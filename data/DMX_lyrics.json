Where the wolves at?\nYou better bust that if you gon' pull that\nWhere the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?\nHave that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?\nOh, them niggas actin' up?!? Where the wolves at?\nYou better bust that if you gon' pull that\n\n[Verse 1]\nMan, cats don't know what it's gonna be\nFuckin' with a nigga like me\nD to the M to the X\nLast I heard, y'all niggas was havin' sex with the same sex\nI show no love to homo thugs\nEmpty out, reload and throw mo' slugs\nHow you gonna explain fuckin' a man?\nEven if we squash the beef, I ain't touchin' your hand\nI don't fuck with chumps\nFor those who been to jail, that's the cat with the Kool-Aid on his lips and pumps\nI don't fuck with niggas that think they broads\nOnly know how to be one way, that's the dog\nI know how to get down, know how to bite\nBark very little, but I know how to fight\nI know how to chase a cat up in the tree\nMan, I give y'all niggas the bidness for fuckin' with me\nIs you crazy?!\n\n[Hook]\nWhere the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?\nHave that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?\nOh, them niggas actin' up?!? Where the wolves at?\nYou better bust that if you gon' pull that\nWhere the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?\nHave that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?\nOh, them niggas actin' up?!? Where the wolves at?\nYou better bust that if you gon' pull that\n\n[Verse 2]\nOnce it's on, I come through, guns is drawn\nBlam blam, lungs are gone, sons will mourn\nFrom dusk till dawn, nighttime belongs to the dog\nOn the street past midnight, look for 'em in the morgue\nDon't play with these cats\n'Cause I ain't got nothin' to say to these cats\nFor the mothers that really do love 'em, please pray for these cats\n'Cause I know niggas is hard-headed but I ain't got the patience\nDon't want me havin' no patience turn into more patients\nMore trips to ICU 'cause I see you\nTryna get away with shit a real nigga wouldn't do\nWhere my dogs at? (Right here!)\nSee them niggas? (Right where?!?)\nGet 'em boy! (Right there!)\nThat's how we do (Alright then!)\nThis is for my dogs, this is for my dogs\nYo, where we at, baby?!? (Creepin' through the fog)\nFrom then till now, don't ask me how\nKnow that we gon' roll like them niggas\nAnd hit every block on the job\n\n[Hook]\nWhere the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?\nHave that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?\nOh, them niggas actin' up?!? Where the wolves at?\nYou better bust that if you gon' pull that\nWhere the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?\nHave that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?\nOh, them niggas actin' up?!? Where the wolves at?\nYou better bust that if you gon' pull that\n\n[Verse 3]\nI get tapes doin' times, stomp niggas like grapes makin' wine\nFive CD's with mad rhymes\nDon't hit me with that positive shit, I know you lyin'\nYou really wanna stop niggas from dyin'? Stop niggas from tryin'\n'Cause I ain't really got that time to waste\nAnd I thought I told you to get these fuckin' bums out my face\nLookin' at you in your grill, I might be nice to cut\nOnce I split your ass in two, you'll be twice as butt\nYeah, you right, I know your style: pussy, 'cause I'm fuckin' it\nSince we all right here, you hold my dick while he suckin' it\nMotherfucker, don't you know you'll never come near me?\nShove your head up your ass, have you seein' shit clearly\nNever heard that D be runnin', because D be gunnin'\nI beat my dick and bust off in your eye so you can see me comin'\nEmpty clips and shells are what I leave behind\nAnd if they get me with the joint, they hit me with a three-to-nine\n\n[Hook]\nWhere the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?\nHave that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?\nOh, them niggas actin' up?!? Where the wolves at?\nYou better bust that if you gon' pull that\nWhere the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?\nHave that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?\nOh, them niggas actin' up?!? Where the wolves at?\nYou better bust that if you gon' pull that\n\n[Outro]\nWhere the fuckin' hood at?!?\nNo one's fuckin' with me, nigga, for real\nI am the hood, I am the streets\nYou bitch-ass nigga!\nTake it how you want, motherfucker\nI\u2019m in the hood all day\nI think I\u2019m like the only nigga, dog, that can go to the projects\n(School Street, Home of the Brave)\nBy his fuckin' self and be good\nYeah, nigga, ask niggas on my projects (Y.O.)\nWhen the last time they seen dog (Not too long ago, baby)\nMotherfucker!\nDee, waah, ugh\u2026 (Y'all niggas is homeless)\nKato\u2026

"[Intro]\nThis life shit, this life shit is like\nIs like bugged the fuck out, son, for real\nSee, to live is to suffer\nBut to survive\u2026\nWell, that's to find meaning in the suffering\n\n[Chorus]\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\n\n[Verse 1]\nI've been through mad different phases like mazes, to find my way\nAnd now I know that happy days are not far away\nIf I'm strong enough I'll live long enough to see my kids\nDoin' somethin' more constructive with their time than bids\nI know because I been there, now I'm in there\nSit back and look at what it took for me to get there\nFirst came the bullshit, the drama with my mama\nShe got on some fly shit so I split and said that I'ma\nBe that seed that doesn't need much to succeed\nStrapped with mad greed and a heart that doesn't bleed\nI'm ready for the world, or at least I thought I was\nBaggin' niggas when I caught a buzz, for thinkin' about how short I was\nGoin' too fast, it wouldn't last, but yo, I couldn't tell\nGroup homes and institutions prepared my ass for jail\nThey put me in a situation forcin' me to be a man\nWhen I was just learnin' to stand without a helping hand\nDamn, was it my fault, somethin' I did\nTo make a father leave his first kid at seven doin' my first bid?\nBack on the scene at fourteen with a scheme\nTo get more cream than I'd ever seen in a dream\nAnd by all means I will be livin' high off the hog\nAnd I never gave a fuck about much but my dog\nThat's my only mothafucka I had offered my last\nJust another little nigga headed nowhere fast\n\n[Chorus]\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\n\n[Verse 2]\nThat ain't the half, shit gets worse as I get older\nActions become bolder, heart got colder\nChip on my shoulder that I dared a nigga to touch\nDidn't need a clique 'cause I scared a nigga that much\nOne deep with the pit startin' shit for kicks\nCatchin' Vicks, throwin' bricks, gettin' by bein' slick\nUsed to get high, just to get by\nUsed to have to puff my L in the morning before I could fly\nAte somethin', a couple of forties made me hate somethin'\nI did some coke, now I'm ready to take somethin'\nThree years later showin' signs of stress\nDidn't keep my hair cut or give a fuck how I dressed\nI'm possessed by the darker side, livin' the cruddy life\nShit like this kept a nigga with a bloody knife\nWanna make records, but I'm fuckin' it up\nI'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\n\n[Chorus]\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\n\n[Verse 3]\nWasn't long before I hit rock bottom\nNiggas talkin' shit, was like, \"Damn, look how that rock got him!\"\nOpen like a window, no more endo\nLook at a video, sayin' to myself: \"That coulda been yo'\nAss on the TV,\" believe me, it could be done\nSomethin's got to give, gots to change 'cause now I've got a son\nI gots to do the right thing for shorty\nAnd that means no more gettin' high, drinkin' 40s\nSo I get back lookin' type slick again\nFake niggas jump back on my dick again\nNothin' but love for those that know how it feel\nAnd much respect to all my niggas that kept it real\nKept a nigga strong, kept a nigga from doin' wrong\nNiggas know who they is and this is your fuckin' song\nAnd to my boo who stuck with a nigga through\nAll the bullshit, you'll get yours because it's due\n\n[Chorus]\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\n\n[Outro]\nSee, this is that shit, this is that shit\nThat all real niggas can relate to\nThis is from the heart, baby\nDon't get it twisted\nX, baby", "image": "https://images.genius.com/515da11d5d46252f603d04fda8629f34.945x945x1.jpg", "artist": "DMX", "raw":

"[Intro]\nThis life shit, this life shit is like\nIs like bugged the fuck out, son, for real\nSee, to live is to suffer\nBut to survive\u2026\nWell, that's to find meaning in the suffering\n\n[Chorus]\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\n\n[Verse 1]\nI've been through mad different phases like mazes, to find my way\nAnd now I know that happy days are not far away\nIf I'm strong enough I'll live long enough to see my kids\nDoin' somethin' more constructive with their time than bids\nI know because I been there, now I'm in there\nSit back and look at what it took for me to get there\nFirst came the bullshit, the drama with my mama\nShe got on some fly shit so I split and said that I'ma\nBe that seed that doesn't need much to succeed\nStrapped with mad greed and a heart that doesn't bleed\nI'm ready for the world, or at least I thought I was\nBaggin' niggas when I caught a buzz, for thinkin' about how short I was\nGoin' too fast, it wouldn't last, but yo, I couldn't tell\nGroup homes and institutions prepared my ass for jail\nThey put me in a situation forcin' me to be a man\nWhen I was just learnin' to stand without a helping hand\nDamn, was it my fault, somethin' I did\nTo make a father leave his first kid at seven doin' my first bid?\nBack on the scene at fourteen with a scheme\nTo get more cream than I'd ever seen in a dream\nAnd by all means I will be livin' high off the hog\nAnd I never gave a fuck about much but my dog\nThat's my only mothafucka I had offered my last\nJust another little nigga headed nowhere fast\n\n[Chorus]\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\n\n[Verse 2]\nThat ain't the half, shit gets worse as I get older\nActions become bolder, heart got colder\nChip on my shoulder that I dared a nigga to touch\nDidn't need a clique 'cause I scared a nigga that much\nOne deep with the pit startin' shit for kicks\nCatchin' Vicks, throwin' bricks, gettin' by bein' slick\nUsed to get high, just to get by\nUsed to have to puff my L in the morning before I could fly\nAte somethin', a couple of forties made me hate somethin'\nI did some coke, now I'm ready to take somethin'\nThree years later showin' signs of stress\nDidn't keep my hair cut or give a fuck how I dressed\nI'm possessed by the darker side, livin' the cruddy life\nShit like this kept a nigga with a bloody knife\nWanna make records, but I'm fuckin' it up\nI'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\n\n[Chorus]\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\n\n[Verse 3]\nWasn't long before I hit rock bottom\nNiggas talkin' shit, was like, \"Damn, look how that rock got him!\"\nOpen like a window, no more endo\nLook at a video, sayin' to myself: \"That coulda been yo'\nAss on the TV,\" believe me, it could be done\nSomethin's got to give, gots to change 'cause now I've got a son\nI gots to do the right thing for shorty\nAnd that means no more gettin' high, drinkin' 40s\nSo I get back lookin' type slick again\nFake niggas jump back on my dick again\nNothin' but love for those that know how it feel\nAnd much respect to all my niggas that kept it real\nKept a nigga strong, kept a nigga from doin' wrong\nNiggas know who they is and this is your fuckin' song\nAnd to my boo who stuck with a nigga through\nAll the bullshit, you'll get yours because it's due\n\n[Chorus]\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\n\n[Outro]\nSee, this is that shit, this is that shit\nThat all real niggas can relate to\nThis is from the heart, baby\nDon't get it twisted\nX, baby"}}, {"title": "What These Bitches Want", "album": "...And Then There Was X", "year": "2000-06-13", "lyrics": "[Verse 1:

of violence in return for fortune and fame. It turns out that this \u201cDamien\u201d that DMX has been conversing with is, in fact, The Devil in disguise; luring DMX with fame and fortune as a rapper only to try to make DMX do things he doesn\u2019t agree with, with Damien later trying to convince DMX to shoot one of his own friends. Think of it as a modern, rap version of Faust.\n\n\u201cDamien\u201d is also the beginning of a trilogy (With The Omen and Damien III.\n\nFun Fact: The name Damien in context with the story is actually a reference to the horror classic \u201cThe Omen\u201d, with Damien, spoiler alert, actually being the Anti-Christ.\n\n\n\n(Damien from The Omen)"}, "comment_count": 13, "community": true,

rest, take my breath\nIf I don't fly I'ma die anyway\nI'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day\nEither let me fly or give me death\nLet my soul rest, take my breath\nIf I don't fly I'ma die anyway\nI'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day\n\n[Verse 1]\nHold me down, niggas wanna know me now\nDidn't want to play with me when to show me how\nNo meow, 'cause it's all about the bark\nLet the dog loose, baby, it's about to spark\nLight up the night like the 4th of July\nNiggas know, when I let go, niggas die\nWith this Y and you don't know, you slow\nLike Baltimore, if you ain't tryin' to go you blow\nI soak up all the pain and accept it in silence\nWhen I let go it's violence, 'cause the wildest\nIs the dog barkin' up the tree for the cat\nIn the fog, what y'all niggas see is the bat\nFlappin' away, but I'm blind like Stevie\nNiggas don't hear me, still tryin' to see me\nStop bein' greedy, you heard what I said\nLet me go, let me flow, or I'm dead\n\n[Hook]\nEither let me fly or give me death\nLet my soul rest, take my breath\nIf I don't fly I'ma die anyway\nI'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day\nEither let me fly or give me death\nLet my soul rest, take my breath\nIf I don't fly I'ma die anyway\nI'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day\n\n[Verse 2]\nI sold my soul to the Devil, and the price was cheap\nAyo, it's cold on this level, 'cause it's twice as deep\nBut you don't hear me, ignorance is bliss and so on\nSometimes it's better to be thought dumb \u2013 shall I go on?\nYo, on the real, what the deal? It's a mystery\nHow is it I can live and make history?\nIf you don't see it, then it wasn't meant for you to see\nIf you wasn't born with it, it wasn't meant for you to be\nBut you can't blame me for not wantin' to be held\nLocked down in a cell where a soul can't dwell\nThis is hell, go get the Devil and give me the key\nBut it can't be worse than the curse that was given to me\nIt's what I live for, you take away that and I'm gone\nThere's a difference between doin' wrong and bein' wrong\nAnd that ain't right, just keep it fair, baby\nPut me in the air and I'll take it there, baby \u2013 yes!\n\n[Hook]\nEither let me fly or give me death\nLet my soul rest, take my breath\nIf I don't fly I'ma die anyway\nI'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day\nEither let me fly or give me death\nLet my soul rest, take my breath\nIf I don't fly I'ma die anyway\nI'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'ma flow regardless because I'm an artist until I'm trapped\nI'ma continue to hit the hardest whether I scrap or rap\nGive me dap, but you ain't my friend\nI see it in your eyes, you contemplate my end\nYou waitin' for that bend in the road where you were told\nThat you would go when you were old and if you died young it was cold\nSold, not for nearly what it was worth\nThink back 26 years, be like, \"What if his birth\nWas a miscarriage and I never existed?\"\nHave I given somethin' that if taken away you'd have missed it?\nDidn't know, yet I persisted, it was the call of the wild\nI merely say what's in my heart and you call it a style\nDon't put it in a cage, don't mistreat it\nYou say you hunger for knowledge? Here it is, eat it!\nAnother song completed is another thought captured\nLet me do my thing, I got it locked with this rap shit\n\n[Hook]\nEither let me fly or give me death\nLet my soul rest, take my breath\nIf I don't fly I'ma die anyway\nI'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day\nEither let me fly or give me death\nLet my soul rest, take my breath\nIf I don't fly I'ma die anyway\nI'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day\n\n[Outro]\nOr give me death\nOr take my breath\nI'ma die anyway\nBut I'll be gone any day\nOr give me death\nOr take my breath\nI'ma die anyway\nBut I'll be gone any day\nWhere my niggas?\nUh, ahh, for my niggas\nUh, ahh, for my niggas\nUh, ahh, for my niggas"}}, {"title": "I Don't Dance", "album": "Undisputed", "year": "2012-04-07", "lyrics": "[Verse 1: DMX]\nY'all lookin'

moves\nStraight up, y'all got somethin' to prove\nY'all niggas duck, but I swing back\nY'all niggas run, but I bring gats\nY'all niggas whisper, \"X is a crackhead\"\nAight fuck it, I'mma just crack heads\nI bang niggas that cross the line\nY'all niggas talk shit from way behind\nI stand my ground, but y'all niggas don't\nShit I go to jail, but y'all niggas won't\nY'all niggas walk around and get scared\nBut I don't give a fuck, I don't care\n\n[Hook (x2)]\nI ain't a dancing nigga, I just move to the beat\nSit there and nod my head but won't move my feet\nGangsta, so I'm holdin' up the wall\nThat dancing shit up to the rest of y'all\n\n[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]\nKells get it crackin', y'all play chess\nKells gets to scrappin' and y'all just flex\nWhy is y'all rappin, when I got next\nYou roll with them and I'll rock with X\nEastside motherfucka, Cleveland Brown\nBurning leaves in the gutta, make it Cleveland loud\nAll I know is when the beefs on, the beast comes out\nEST is

toes\nI come through hard, kickin' down doors\nI spit a mean 16 without a pause\nThen let 16 go just because\nYou in it for the dough, I'm in it for life\nYou in jail beatin' your dick\nI'm fuckin' your wife\nI bring the drama, I bring the noise\nKidnap yo mama, bring her to the boys\nI make shit happen with one word\nYou take shit laughin' nigga, you's a bird\nI take niggas for everything they

"[Intro]\nYeah\nUhh\nIn the name of Jesus, spread the word\n\"No weapon formed against me shall prosper and every turn that rise against my judgment, thou shall condemn\"\n(Lord give me a sign)\nFor this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord\n\"And their righteousness is of me,\" said the Lord\nAmen, Lord, give me a sign!\n\n[Verse 1]\nI really need talk to you, Lord\nSince the last time we talked the walk has been hard\nNow I know you haven't left me, but I feel like I'm alone\nI'm a big boy now, but I'm still not grown\nAnd I'm still going through it, pain and the hurt\nSoaking up trouble like rain in the dirt\nAnd I know only I can stop the rain with just the mention of my savior's name, in the name of Jesus\nDevil, I rebuke you, for what I go through\nBeen trying to make me do what I used to\nBut all that stops right here\nAs long as the Lord's in my life I will have no fear\nI will know no pain from the light to the dark\nI will show no shame, spit it right from the heart\nCause it's right from the start, you held me down\nAnd ain't nothing they can tell me now. Lord, give me a sign!\n\n[Hook]\nLet me know what's on your mind\nLet me know what I'm gon' find\nIt's all in time, show me how to teach the mind\nShow me how to reach the blind. Lord, give me a sign!\nShow me what I gotsta do to bring me closer to you\nCause I'ma go through whatever you want me to\nJust let me know what to do. Lord, give me a sign!\n\n[Verse 2]\nPlease, show me somethin'\nI'm tired of talking to him, knowing he frontin'\nCrying about, \"Life ain't nothin\", but you either be the one mad cause you trapped or the one huntin'\nTrapped in your own mind, waiting on the Lord\nOr hunting with the word that cuts like a sword\nThe spoken word is stronger than the strongest man\nCarries the whole world like the strongest hand\nThrough the trials and tribulations, you never let us down\nJesus, I know you're here with us now\nJesus, I know you're still with us now\nKeep it real with us now, I wanna feel, show me how\nLet me take your hand, guide me\nI'll walk slow, but stay right beside me\nDevil's trying to find me\nHide me! Hold up, I take that back\nProtect me and give me the strength to fight back\nLord, give me a sign\n\n[Hook]\nLet me know what's on your mind\nLet me know what I'm gon' find\nIt's all in time, show me how to teach the mind\nShow me how to reach the blind. Lord, give me a sign!\nShow me what I gotsta do to bring me closer to you\nCause I'ma go through whatever you want me to\nJust let me know what to do. Lord, give me a sign!\n\n[Bridge]\nLife or death, live or die\nI will never live a lie\nI'm going there because I try\nI won't give in till I die\nI'm gon' make it, wrong or right\nMake it through the darkest night\nWhen the morning comes you'll see\nAll I have is God in me\n\nLord give me a sign!\nPlease\nLord give me a sign!\nLord give me a sign!\n\n[Hook]\nLet me know what's on your mind\nLet me know what I'm gon' find\nIt's all in time, show me how to teach the mind\nShow me how to reach the blind. Lord, give me a sign!\nShow me what I gotsta do to bring me closer to you\nCause I'ma go through whatever you want me to\nJust let me know what to do.

On a November 2017 episode of the \u201cDrink Champs\u201d podcast Irv Gotti revealed that DMX was attacking  Ja Rule after the Dog grew tired of musical comparisons to Rule as a result of Ja\u2019s 1999 solo debut single \u201cHolla Holla.\u201d\n\nGotti\u2019s timeline appears to be off because Flesh of my Flesh, Blood of my Blood was released in December 1998, while \u201cHolla Holla\u201d was officially released in March 1999. Despite it\u2019s official release date, it\u2019s very possible that \u201cHolla, Holla\u201d appeared on underground mixtapes several months leading up to Def Jam\u2019s official release.\n\nI made this record, I give X the beat\u2026 I\u2019m in the studio as soon as I hear it I know he\u2019s on the bullshit. he\u2019s shittin' on Rule in that record.\n\nThrough the years the war of words progressed on songs like DMX\u2019s \u201cDo You\u201d and \u201cthey Want War\u201d as well as Rule\u2019s \u201cBlood In My Eye.\u201d\n\nThe two old friends have since buried the hatchet."},

over a dark and gritty Irv Gotti-produced beat.\n\nOn the track X is taking shots at an unnamed adversary who he feels crossed him. On a November 2017 episode of the \u201cDrink Champs\u201d podcast Irv Gotti revealed that DMX was attacking  Ja Rule after the Dog grew tired of musical comparisons to Rule as a result of Ja\u2019s 1999 solo debut single \u201cHolla Holla.\u201d\n\nGotti\u2019s timeline appears to be off because Flesh of my Flesh, Blood of my Blood was released in December 1998, while \u201cHolla Holla\u201d was officially released in March 1999. Despite it\u2019s official release date, it\u2019s very possible that \u201cHolla, Holla\u201d appeared on underground mixtapes several months leading up to Def Jam\u2019s official release.\n\nI made this record, I give X the beat\u2026 I\u2019m in the studio as soon as I hear it I know he\u2019s on the bullshit. he\u2019s shittin' on Rule in that record.\n\nThrough the years the war of words progressed on songs like DMX\u2019s \u201cDo You\u201d and \u201cthey Want War\u201d as well as Rule\u2019s \u201cBlood In My Eye.\u201d\n\nThe two old friends have since buried the hatchet."},

really never gave a fuck how niggas feel\nRob and I steal, not cause I want to cause I have to\nAnd don't make me show you what the MAC do\nIf you don't know by now then you slipping\nI'm on some bullshit that's got me jacking, niggas flipping\nLet my man and them stay pretty and I'ma stay shitty\nCruddy it's all for the money, is you wit' me?\nGet the bitches, and I'll commit the crime\nAnd when it's on we transform like Optimus Prime\nI'll form the head, roll out let's make it happen\nIf we ain't gonna get it wit them we'll take your cap\nBust it off dusting off the softest niggas\nMoney with the biggest mouth, yo let's off this nigga\nUp North this nigga never made a sound\nBreath too fucking hard and you're getting bust down\n\n[Hook: Sheek, DMX]\nYo, yo y'all niggas wanna be killers (get at me dog)\nY'all niggas wanna feel us (get at me dog)\nY'all niggas want the real (Get at me dog)\n(Rrrrrr arf arf, what the deal)\nYo, yo y'all niggas wanna be killers (get at

hurting niggas\n(What you doing?) Robbing niggas, jerking niggas, sticking niggas\nCause they deserve it; when money got murdered\nThey know he died slow cause they heard it\nThe nigga ain't blew up the spot a while\nAnd the mother fucker ain't got shot in a while\nIt just takes a light up to fuck the night up\nBlow everything in sight up, fuck around and I'll have your ass right up\nWhen you mention some shit you wasn't able to stand\nI got shit that'll disable a man with the wave of a hand\nThe days are longer and seems like I'm facing time\nI've got a lot of dreams but I'm not really chasing mine\nI soak it all up like a sitting fly\nCause nowadays getting by, nothing more than an occasional meal and getting high\nI live to die, That's where I'm headed\nLet your man hold something, now it's all about you can get it\n\n[Hook]\nYo, yo y'all niggas wanna be killers (get at me dog)\nY'all niggas wanna feel us (get at me dog)\nY'all niggas want the real (Get at me dog)\n(Rrrrrr arf arf, what the deal)\nYo, yo y'all niggas wanna be killers (get at me dog)\nY'all niggas wanna feel us (get at me dog)\nY'all niggas want the real (Get at me dog)\n(Rrrrrr arf arf, what the deal)\n\n[Verse 3: DMX]\nOne in the back wit ya faggot ass face down\nLucky that you breathing, but you dead from the waist-down\nThe fuck is on your mind? Talking that shit that you be talking\nAnd I bet you wish you never got hit cause you be walking\nBut shit happens and fuck it, you done did your dirt\nNiggas is wondering how the fuck you hid your skirt\nRight under their eyes like a surprise to the guys\nThat one of their mans was a bitch in disguise\nFucking with cats that order more hits and slaughter more kids\nLet me holla at you yo Baltimore shit (ah-oh!)\nKnahmean? I'm just robbing to eat\nAnd there's at least a thousand of us like me mobbing the street\nWhen we're starving, we eat whatever's there\nCome on you know the code in the street; whatever's fair\nBlood stains and chalk, means your man couldn't walk\nAfter the talk, about him not being 11-33 to New York\nTransforming-ass niggas'll get it quick\nAnd yo for real that nigga K can suck my dick\nAnd it's gon' take all these niggas in the rap game to barely move me\nCause when I blow shit up, I have niggas falling like white bitches in a scary movie\nAHHH! You know I don't know how to act\nGet too close to niggas it's like: \"Protected by Viper, stand back\"\nWhat's this? I thought you niggas was killers, demented\nThe fuck you want me to do with this coward? Finish him, it's ended\n(*EXPLOSION*)"}}, {"title": "Blackout", "album": "Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood", "year": "1998-12-22", "lyrics": "[Intro]\n(Jay!)

all\n\n[Hook: Nardo]\nI can feel it coming in the air tonight, hold on\nI've been waiting for this moment for all my life\nHold on, hold on\n\n[Verse 1: DMX]\nThe best of y'all niggas remind me of myself when I was younger\nWhen it was hunger that stopped a nigga from goin' under\nAnd you wonder why I pat you on your head and smile\nLook in your eyes and thank the Lord for my child\nMeanwhile, somethin' I gotta show you, and I hope you can take it\nGotta leave you in the desert, and I hope that you make it\nGotta put you on yo' ass to see what it does to you\nWhen you stand up, you see that I'm just showin' love to you\nOther niggas'll put a slug through you, over your ends\nCats I fucked with are real, but hey, those are your friends\nIt's just what you got comin', sometimes you don't know\nWhat you askin' for, yet you ask for more\nShut the casket door, this one here good as done\nThey thought you was a killer, you swore you'd never run\nNigga died with his gun still up in the holster\nIt is comin' in the air? Yeah, it's gettin' closer\n\n[Hook: Nardo]\nI can feel it coming in the air tonight, hold on\nI've been waiting for this moment for all my life\nHold on, hold on\n\n[Verse 2: DMX]\nI see life through many shades of grays and blacks\nI could take that and hit 'em with the blazin' tracks\nWhen I make that you fake cats have violent dreams\nIt takes another dog to be able to hear my silent screams\nThe Devil got a hold on me, and he won't let go\nI can feel the Lord pullin', but he movin' dead slow\nLet 'em know that amidst all this confusion\nSome of us may do the winnin', but we all do the losin'\nIt's just who does the choosin', is you goin' up or down?\nWhat have you been provin'? Just that you were a fuckin' clown\nBeen seen the bullshit but never spoke on it\n\u2018Cause I know that deep down you really don't want it\nI was traded the chance of bein' a child with a father\nFor a talent and bein' able to survive when it's harder\nMy balance on the high beams of life, keep my dreams in strife\nThat's why I hit these motherfuckin' streets at night \u2013 come on!\n\n[Hook: Nardo]\nI can feel it coming\nIn the air tonight, hold on\nI've been waiting\nFor this moment for all my life\nHold on, hold on\n\n[Verse 3]\nThere's a lot of shit that I let slide, \u2018cause it's outta my hands\nLot of niggas I let ride, but it's not in my plans\nThat a lot of my mans is not seein' through the fog\nFamilies by the truckloads, fleein' to the morgue\nFull moon, (ah-oo) \u2013 the howlin'\n(Grr) \u2013 the growlin', (shh) \u2013 the prowlin'\nDon't know love, can't show love\nThat means you gonna need mo' love than an old thug\nBut hold up, roll up, talkin' out the side of your mouth\nIs what's gonna let niggas know why you died in your house\nWhile they lied to your spouse, told her it was suicide\nBut you and I both knew, the truth'll never die\nListen, nigga, if you scared, get a dog\nBut be prepared for the mob\n\u2018Cause you dead up in the fog\nAnd that's your head by the log\nI can smell it in the air, I can tell when it's there\nThis is hell and we're both here, can you feel it? Tell me yeah!\n\n[Hook: Nardo]\nI can feel it coming\nIn the air tonight, hold on\nI've been waiting\nFor this moment for all my life\nHold on, hold on"}}, {"title": "What's My Name", "album": "...And Then There Was X", "year": "1999-12-21", "lyrics": "[Intro: DMX]\nThis is the fuckin shit I be talkin about\nHalf rappin' ass mothafuckers\nYou think it's a game?

niggas I don't even know that wanna murder me\nJust because they've heard of me, and they know that the Dark is for real\nThe bark is for real, (arf) when you see that spark it'll kill\nPeep how I park it and chill, take it over there, bark wit' it\nFrom Y.O. to Cali to Baltimore back to New York wit' it\nCome through flyin', up 1-2-9\nUp the School Street 'cause I come through mine\nBark at my dogs, \"Get at me, nigga!\"\n\"Arf! Arf! Arf! Get at me, nigga!\"\nWhat the deal is? Never forget what real is\nThem cats that used to say \"X is the best,\" know he still is\nCan't help but feel this, puttin' goosebumps on your arms\nTake you there if you want but I lose chumps with the bomb\nIt's the calm before the storm\nDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and it's gettin' warm, feel me yo\n\n[Hook]\nLook through my eyes and see what I see\nDo as I do, be what I be\nWalk in my shoes and hurt your feet\nThen know why I do dirt in the street\nLook through my eyes and see what I see\nDo as I do, be what I be\nWalk in my shoes and hurt your feet\nThen know why I do dirt in the street\n\n[Verse 2]\nI can understand why y'all niggas is scared of me\nAnd why the big dogs never wanted to play fair with me\n'Cause I leave blood wherever I go, wherever I flow\nWherever I blow niggas who know I can go, feel me yo\nWhat is it about the Dark that gets niggas where they about to spark\nAbout to bark, take it to the heart 'cause it's real like that\nGive him chills, but do I make him feel like that\nShit is real, what you don't know is gon' get ya\nWith the steel, what you don't know is gon' split ya\nI can blaze tracks, make niggas play wax and raise stacks\nPayback's a bitch; didn't you used to say that?\nPlay around in dirt, you'll get mud\n'Cause you know, I can either spread love or shed blood\nAnd bloodshed turns the mud red and real sticky\nOr I can hit you from roof, make it a quicky\nFor real\n\n[Hook]\nLook through my eyes and see what I see\nDo as I do, be what I be\nWalk in my shoes and hurt your feet\nThen know why I do dirt in the street\nLook through my eyes and see what I see\nDo as I do, be what I be\nWalk in my shoes and hurt your feet\nThen know why I do dirt in the street\n\n[Verse 3]\nI bear my soul, niggas wouldn't dare, my role\nGives a nigga a heart of gold, but with a hole\nLost all control, my shoulders hold a lot of weight\nJust like first time sold an eighth, then told it's not an eighth\nBut then it's out of state, and it's too late for changes to be made\nThat's what I get for fuckin' with strangers in the shade\nThis is it, y'all niggas got to give me a plate\nFor the same reason that fate chose to give me the weight\nTake away hate, now I'm supposed to love the one that cursed me\nThe one that wouldn't give me a cup of water when I was thirsty\nIt was always him versus me, but now I gotta teach him\nPersonal feelin's put aside, 'cause now I gotta reach him\nWhat I'd like to do is turn my head, like I don't know him\nBut it seems like I've been called on to show him, so I'ma show him\nAnd if you never met me, then you've no right to judge me\nI've got a good heart but this heart can get ugly\n\n[Hook]\nLook through my eyes and see what I see\nDo as I do, be what I be\nWalk in my shoes and hurt your feet\nThen know why I do dirt in the street\nLook through my eyes and see what I see\nDo as I do, be what I be\nWalk in my shoes and hurt your feet\nThen know why I do dirt in the street\n\n[Outro]\nFeel the pain, feel the joy, of a man who was never a boy\nFor real\nArf arf, arf arf arf"}}, {"title": "Ready to Meet Him", "album": "Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood", "year": "1998-12-22", "lyrics": "[Part 1: Prayer II]\n\nLet us pray...\nI thank you, Lord, for my birth and everything that's followed\nI thank you, Lord, for today, and I will pray for tomorrow\nI thank you, Lord, for the love of my life and a friend\nI made a promise and I'm lovin' my wife 'til the end\nI thank you, Lord, for your guidance, 'cause it's all that counts\nAnd right here, right now...

followed\nI thank you, Lord, for today, and I will pray for tomorrow\nI thank you, Lord, for the love of my life and a friend\nI made a promise and I'm lovin' my wife 'til the end\nI thank you, Lord, for your guidance, 'cause it's all that counts\nAnd right here, right now... Lord, this is your house\nI thank you, Lord, for a dream that came true to light\nAnd I ask you to bless everybody in this room tonight\nI don't always do the right thing and I ask you to forgive me\n'Cause I need You here wit me, without You in my life it's empty\nI think back how some people did me like, violence was the remedy\nAnd because I think of that now, I pray for my enemy\nNot because of what I'll do, but because they don't know\nThere's somethin' better after here, but everybody won't go\nSo I ask You to forgive them and we'll hope they see\nAnd I thank You for the love that they've given to me\nI will not abuse it nor will I lead them astray\nYou see I love 'em like children, that I see everyday\nAnd I pray... no, we pray... together\nGet us through the bad weather, and we love You forever\nLet Your thought and my heart go hand in hand\nI first thought but to start, but I stand a man\nAnd for as long as I can, as long as You permit me\nPlease give me the strength I need to live, bear with me\nAmen\n\n[Part 2: Ready to Meet Him]\n\n[Intro]\nWe each walk the path that we've chosen (Yes)\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm ready to meet him\n'Cause where I'm livin' ain't right, black hate white\nWhite hate black, it's right back to the same fight\nThey got us suspectin' a war\nBut the real war is to follow the law of the Lord\n\n[Verse 1]\nLord, You left me stranded and I don't know why\nTold me to live my life, now I'm ready to die\nReady to fly, I cry, but I shed no tears\nYou told me You would dead those fears, it's been years\nSnakes still comin' at me, just missin'\nSometimes I think all You do with me is just listen\nI thought that I was special, that's what You told me\nHold me, stop actin' like You don't know me\nWhat I do so bad that it sent You away from me?\nNot only sent You away, but made You stay away from me?\n\"My child I'm here as I've always been\nIt is you who went away and now are back again\nWhat did I say?\" Follow Your word and be true\n\"What did you do?\" Well, what I wanted to do\n\"What have you seen?\" Darkness and hell at a glance\n\"What do you want?\" All I want is another chance\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm ready to meet him\n'Cause where I'm livin' ain't right, black hate white\nWhite hate black, it's right back to the same fight\nThey got us suspectin' a war\nBut the real war is to follow the law of the Lord\nI'm ready to meet him\n'Cause where I'm livin' ain't right, black hate white\nWhite hate black, it's right back to the same fight\nThey got us suspectin' a war\nBut the real war is to follow the law of the Lord\n\n[Verse 2]\n\"Just because you went away, my doors are not locked\nWanna come back home?

be destroyed\nYet from this body, I will see God\nYes, I will see Him for myself\nAnd I long for that moment\n\n[Verse 1: DMX]\nGrandma, I really miss you, and it ain't been the same\nI drop a tear when I hear your name\nMary Ella Holloway, why you gotta be so far away?\nUsed to say, \"Don't worry, it's gon' be okay\"\nBut it ain't \u2013 it's like when you left, you took the Lord with you\nWhy couldn't I come when He came to get you?\nDamn, I really miss you\u2026 I had to say it again\nI remember the time when I was like 10\nCrept up in the neighbor's yard, yeah, bein' hard headed\nYou told me I would get it \u2013 you said it!\nAnd boy did I get it, but after you spanked me, you hugged me\nKissed me on my forehead, told me that you love me\nAnd I saw that it hurt you more than it hurt me\nI thought, how bad could this hurt be?\nI know now, that's why it's only done out of love\nWhat I wouldn't give for one mo' hug, from grandma\n\n[Chorus: Faith Evans (DMX)]\nBaby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that\u2026)\nBaby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'\u2026)\nBaby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that\u2026)\nBaby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'\u2026)\n\n[Verse 2: DMX]\nWhat I'm about to say a couple of family members is gon' hate me\nBut I'ma let you know what's been goin' on lately\nNow you know since you left a lot of things with your kids done changed\nYeah, Jackie's still crazy, don't know what's up with James\nAin't seen Jerry in a while, you know he walk like you\nAnd Ren\u00e9e's back in jail, you know she talk like you\nRiculah's(?) doing real good now, she workin'\nRhonda's still runnin' around, trickin', jerkin'\nBuckeye's buggin', he done lost his mind\nAnd Jarvis? Back out of jail, doin' fine\nKylie? He done changed, it ain't all about self\nAs for my father... well, that's somethin' else\nBut that's my dog, he hold his grandmother down\nMy great grandmother, makin' a lot of trips out of town\nBut that's a good thing, and if I could only hear you sing\nOnce more, oh Lord, the comfort it would bring\n\n[Chorus: Faith Evans (DMX)]\nBaby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that\u2026)\nBaby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'\u2026)\nBaby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that\u2026)\nBaby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'\u2026)\n\n[Verse 3: DMX (Faith Evans)]\nYou left behind a mother, eleven kids, eleven grand-kids\nAnd since then, two of your grand-kids done had kids\nThey had a boy named Tacoma, Xavier's brother\nThat's right, Xavier's made you a great-grandmother\nI thank you for the best times of my life\nI thank you for when you first met her acceptin' and lovin' my wife\nI thank you for those Sunday dinners, they were vital\nI thank you for my life, I thank you for the Bible\nI thank you for the songs that you'd sing in the mornin'\n(Amazing Grace\u2026) while I'm yawnin'\nI thank you for the two beatings you gave me\n'Cause I know somewhere along the line the lesson I learned from the two beatings saved me\nAnd when you died I cried like a baby, I begged the Lord to take me\n'Cause no one else could give me what you gave me\nBut life, like everything, comes to an end\nI pray I go to Heaven to see you again \u2013 Amen\n\n[Chorus: Faith Evans (DMX)]\nBaby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that\u2026)\nBaby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'\u2026)\nBaby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that\u2026)\nBaby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'\u2026)\nBaby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that\u2026)\nBaby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'\u2026)\nBaby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that\u2026)\nBaby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'\u2026)\n\n[Outro: Faith Evans]\nAmazing Grace, how sweet the sound\nThat saved a wretch like me\nI once was lost, but now I'm found\nWas blind, but now I see, yeah"}}, {"title": "Damien III", "album": "The Great Depression", "year": "2001-10-23", "lyrics": "[Verse 1: DMX and Damien]\nHey yo, D!

Let me show you!\nDidn't I promise you a Benz, lots of friends,\nCountless pairs of Timbs, these endless ends?\nYeah, but what did it cost me?\nMy life to be taken softly; man, back the fuck up off me!\nDon't fuck with me like that when I fuck with you like this\nDon't come at me like that when you know that you might miss!\nGo on about your business!\nIf any cat you send my way, ain't gon' be no witness!\nLORD JESUS C'mon, dog, look who you're fuckin'\nPLEASE HELP ME Whassup, dog?

It's your nigga D!\nWhat the fuck, you forgot about me?\nYou've been eatin' real good lately\nDidn't get a shout out on your last album, what, you hate me?\nSaid I was your dog\nSaid I was your nigga that let you see it all through the fog\nSaid I was your mans and them\nAnd any problem that you had I would handle them\nAyo, dog, it's like this, I fuck with you lightly\n\u2018Cause I knew if I fucked with you too deep you'd bite me\nGet mad at me, send niggas wantin' to fight me\nWhole time you fucked with me you didn't like me\nDog, where you hear that? Pssh, niggas talk\nPlus you know how shit flow in New York:\nWalls have ears, buildings heard\nSupposed to be shhhhhh, but spill the word\n\n[Hook: DMX and Damien]\nEverywhere that I go, everything that I see\nEvery place that I touch, I feel him fuckin' with me\nI'm gonna fly\u2026\nWhy you lie?\nTold me it was Ryde or Die\nI'm gonna fly\u2026\nEye for an eye\nWhat happened to my piece of the pie?\n\n[Verse 2: DMX and Damien]\nNow, dog, you know me better than that\nI could put you ahead of the pack instead of the back\nI could have niggas sellin' tapes instead of the crack\nCould have niggas fallin' down with lead in they back\nAin't much that I can't do when I want to\nI don't really need you; nigga, fuck you!\nWHAT?!\nNah, I'm just playin'; got a wife and kids?\nGood thing they ain't come across them triflin' kids...\nYo, what you mean by that? Mean by what?\nYou'se a grimy nigga f'real, I see what's up!\nI don't even know why I fucked with you from the door!\n\u2018Cause you know I can give you what you wanted and more\nI could've got it from Him! But you would've had to wait!\nBut I wouldn't have the weight! C'mon, don't hate!\nWhat happened to the right hand, Light Man?\nNah, that's Dark Man! Well, let's get it right then!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: DMX and Damien]\nNow I see you for who you are, it's like I know you\nSo I can't trust you as far as I can throw you!\nOh you don't know, you are the reason\nThat I go through what I go through? Let me show you!\nDidn't I promise you a Benz, lots of friends,\nCountless pairs of Timbs, these endless ends?\nYeah, but what did it cost me?\nMy life to be taken softly; man, back the fuck up off me!\nDon't fuck with me like that when I fuck with you like this\nDon't come at me like that when you know that you might miss!\nGo on about your business!\nIf any cat you send my way, ain't gon' be no witness!\nLORD JESUS C'mon, dog, look who you're fuckin'\nPLEASE HELP ME Whassup, dog? Man, you buggin'\nKEEP THE DEVIL Thug life, thought we was tight\nOUT OF MY LIFE! I'll be back, aight?

everything was black because my eyes were closed\nYou gave me the light and let me bask in your glory\nSo it was only right that when you ask for this story\nI put it together to do our dogs some good\nOur dogs bein' brothers and sisters in the hood\nPlenty of times you sent help my way, but I hid\nAnd I remember once you held me close, but I slid\nThere was somethin' that I just had to see\nThat you wanted me to see so I can be what you wanted me to be\nAnd I think I've seen it, 'cause I don't feel the same\nMatter of fact, I know I've seen it, I can feel the change\nAnd it's strange, almost got me beatin' down your door\nBut I've never known a love like this before\nIt's a wonderful feelin' to get away from the pain\nAnd up under the ceilin' I get away from the rain\nAnd the strain that I feel when I'm here is gone\nI know real, so I wipe away the tears; it's on\nAnd I almost lost faith when you took my man\nMonty, Paso, and Jay's brother Dan\nAnd I fear that what I'm sayin' won't be heard until I'm gone\nBut it's all good, 'cause I really didn't expect to live long\nSo if it takes for me to suffer, for my brother to see the light\nGive me pain 'til I die, but please, Lord, treat him right"}}, {"title": "No Sunshine", "album": "Simmz Beatz Presents - The Best Of DMX", "year": "2001-01-01", "lyrics": "It's dark, and hell is hot\n\n[Hook]\nAin't no sunshine

but being true\nBut..\n\nNow I know\nOnly I can stop the rain\n\nIt doesn't have to be the way it is\nYou say it is\nJust because for the past 20 years\nEveryday it is (WhAt?)\n\nNow I know\nOnly I can stop the rain\n\nI won't even be able to walk out my front door\nWithout worrying about coming to conflict with the law\nCuz\n\nNow I know\nOnly I can stop the rain\n\nIf I follow him, they'll follow me\nAnd I'll speak life into the words that you can see\nCuz\n\nNow I know (c'mon)\nOnly I can stop the rain\n\nWe get away with it everyday shit\nBut everyday shit catches up with you\nAnd when it does you can't say shit\n\nNow I know\nOnly I can stop the rain\n\nIf I don't, you will\nWhat I won't, you still\nWhat makes us feel like we gots to kill\nWhen\n\nNow I know\nOnly I can stop the rain\n\nHow many more lives must we lose\nHow many more times must we choose\nTo trust these fools\n\nNow I know\nOnly I can stop the rain\n\nIf it ain't broke, don't fix it\nI gave it to you straight, don't mix it\nTwist it (what) up for some slick shit\n\nNow I know\nOnly I can stop the rain\n\nI don't have to talk to it anymore\nI don't have to walk to it anymore\nI'm out the door (what)\n\nNow I know\nOnly I can stop the rain\n\nI wanna find peace with the lord\nI don't wanna find the peace with the sword\nI can't afford to\n\nNow I know\nOnly I can stop the rain\n\nWhen everyday of my life\nIs just a constant fight\nBetween wrong and right\n\nNow I know\nOnly I can stop the rain\n\nI thank you lord for my life\nI thank you lord for keeping it loose when things got tight\n\nNow I know\nOnly I can stop the rain\n\nOnly I can stop the rain\nOnly I can stop the pain\n\nNow I know\nOnly I can stop the rain\n\nOnly I can stop the rain, stop the rain\n\nOnly I can stop the rain\nOnly I can stop the rain because the rain calls on me\n\nNow I know\nOnly I can stop the rain\n\nOnly I can stop the rain\n\nI'm out"}}, {"title": "Get it on the Floor", "album": "Grand

on the floor\nGet it on the floor\nGet it, get it on the floor\nYou don't wanna party then your ass gotta go\nYou don't wanna party then your ass gotta go\nNow you can ride to this motherfucker\nBounce to this motherfucker\nFreak to this motherfucker\n(Let's get it on)\nGet it on the floor\nGet it, get it on the floor\nGet it on the floor\nGet it, get it on the floor\n\n[Verse 1: DMX]\nOnce again it's the darker nigga\nHit or spark a nigga, break apart a nigga\nBut the dog is bigger, under stress\nSo unless you're wanting to bless to the chest\nThese slugs from the smiff n wess\nOr the pump'll put a hurt on a nigga\nDump six motherfuckin feet of dirt on a nigga\nMy hands stay dirty, 'cause I play dirty the mob way\nYou don't know, fuck it find out the hard\nA nigga's job is never done\nI handle my business how it come\nAnd there's never been a one on one\nThere hasn't been a problem, I dissolve em like salt, lock it up\nHate to fall but never wreck his car\nAnd it's my fault, keep niggas on point ducking down\nNiggas like you need to get bust, you fucking clown\nI extort to support my peeps\nAnd hold down the fort, never get caught, 'cause I creeps, nigga!\n\n[Hook: Swizz Beatz (DMX)]\nGet it on the floor\nGet it, get it on the floor\nGet it on the floor\nGet it, get it on the floor\nYou don't wanna party then your ass gotta go\nYou don't wanna

it on the floor\nGet it, get it on the floor\n\n[Verse 2: DMX]\nI'm at the crossroads, look but I'm not really sure which way to go\nShould I play that low for what I did the other day\nThey on their way to float, got me striking this random\nI can't stand em, fake-ass niggas want to be the Phantom\nLooking over my shoulder, cause it's colder than it was\nAnd start shorty, because I'm a little older than cuz\nAnd the buzz from the saw, wit the chain to your brain\nWill turn that big nigga to a fucking stain\nThe pain from the dirt makes the hurt go away for a minute\nBut I'm gon die by it 'cause I'm like knee-deep in it\nAnd you motherfuckers wonder why I start shit?\n'Cause when you look in my face, you see that hard shit!\n\"Cause I done been to Hell and back I ain't wit selling crack\nI'd rather rob a nigga, leave him wit a shell up in his back\nOn the real just to show proof, hit the G.W.B\nAnd blow the whole roof off the toll booth bitch ass nigga\n\n[Hook: Swizz Beatz

get it on the floor\n\n[Verse 3: DMX]\nWhen I crawl, leave a nigga sprawled out after I spoke em\nI'll slit his throat, dick in the mud and let his blood choke em\nUp north niggas get the pick stuck up in em\nAnd in the streets bitches get the dick stuck up in em\nMy M.O. is man-slaughter kid\n'Cause on the reals I done wet up more motherfuckers than water did\nSlid, cause I got to slide when the dirt is done\nA homicide but they want me on the Murder 1\nBut as long as I got my gun, I'm aight\nStay outta sight while it's light, and then come out at night\nTo make moves again, stomp and bruise again\nI know I'm going to Hell, 'cause I choose to sin\nAll my motherfucking life I been the Devil's advocate\nNow niggas never even knew the Devil had a kid\nBut he does; and when you hear the buzz of the chainsaw\nYou'll know why I'll split your motherfucking brains for!\n\n[Hook: Swizz Beatz (DMX)]\nGet it on the floor\nGet it, get it on the floor\nGet it on the floor\nGet it, get it on the

wanna party then your ass gotta go\nNow you can ride to this motherfucker\nBounce to this motherfucker\nFreak to this motherfucker\n(Let's get it on)\nGet it on the floor\nGet it, get it on the floor\nGet it on the floor\nGet it, get it on the floor\n\n[Verse 1: DMX]\nOnce again it's the darker nigga\nHit or spark a nigga, break apart a nigga\nBut the dog is bigger, under stress\nSo unless you're wanting to bless to the chest\nThese slugs from the smiff n wess\nOr the pump'll put a hurt on a nigga\nDump six motherfuckin feet of dirt on a nigga\nMy hands stay dirty, 'cause I play dirty the mob way\nYou don't know, fuck it find out the hard\nA nigga's job is never done\nI handle my business how it come\nAnd there's never been a one on one\nThere hasn't been a problem, I dissolve em like salt, lock it up\nHate to fall but never wreck his car\nAnd it's my fault, keep niggas on point ducking down\nNiggas like you need to get bust, you fucking clown\nI extort to support my peeps\nAnd hold down the fort, never get caught, 'cause I creeps, nigga!\n\n[Hook: Swizz Beatz (DMX)]\nGet it on the floor\nGet it, get it on the floor\nGet it on the floor\nGet it, get it on the

sure which way to go\nShould I play that low for what I did the other day\nThey on their way to float, got me striking this random\nI can't stand em, fake-ass niggas want to be the Phantom\nLooking over my shoulder, cause it's colder than it was\nAnd start shorty, because I'm a little older than cuz\nAnd the buzz from the saw, wit the chain to your brain\nWill turn that big nigga to a fucking stain\nThe pain from the dirt makes the hurt go away for a minute\nBut I'm gon die by it 'cause I'm like knee-deep in it\nAnd you motherfuckers wonder why I start shit?\n'Cause when you look in my face, you see that hard shit!\n\"Cause I done been to Hell and back I ain't wit selling crack\nI'd rather rob a nigga, leave him wit a shell up in his back\nOn the real just to show proof, hit the G.W.B\nAnd blow the whole roof off the toll booth bitch ass nigga\n\n[Hook: Swizz Beatz (DMX)]\nGet it on the floor\nGet it, get it on the floor\nGet it on the floor\nGet it, get it on the floor\nYou

throat, dick in the mud and let his blood choke em\nUp north niggas get the pick stuck up in em\nAnd in the streets bitches get the dick stuck up in em\nMy M.O. is man-slaughter kid\n'Cause on the reals I done wet up more motherfuckers than water did\nSlid, cause I got to slide when the dirt is done\nA homicide but they want me on the Murder 1\nBut as long as I got my gun, I'm aight\nStay outta sight while it's light, and then come out at night\nTo make moves again, stomp and bruise again\nI know I'm going to Hell, 'cause I choose to sin\nAll my motherfucking life I been the Devil's advocate\nNow niggas never even knew the Devil had a kid\nBut he does; and when you hear the buzz of the chainsaw\nYou'll know why I'll split your motherfucking brains for!\n\n[Hook: Swizz Beatz (DMX)]\nGet it on the floor\nGet it, get it on the floor\nGet it on the floor\nGet it, get it on the floor\nYou don't wanna party then your ass gotta go\nYou don't wanna party then your ass gotta go\nNow you can ride to this motherfucker\nBounce to this motherfucker\nFreak to this motherfucker\n(Let's get it on)\nGet it on the floor\nGet it, get it on the floor\nGet it on the floor\nGet it,

blatant\nThat with all the blood here, I'm dealin' with Satan\nPlus with all the hatin', it's hard to keep peace (uh huh)\nThou shall not steal, but I will to eat\nI tried doin' good, but good's not too good for me\nMisunderstood, why you chose the hood for me?\nMe? I'm aight; I just had to work hard at it\nWent to grandma for the answer and she told me that God had it\nSo now here I am, confused and full of questions\nAm I born to lose or is this just a lesson?\nAnd who is gon' choose when it gets turned around\nAnd will it be laying in my own blood and on the ground?\nMy child, I've watched you grow up and I've been there\nEven at those times you least suspected it, I was there\nAnd look at what I've given you - a talent to rhyme\nI may not come when you call, but I'm always on time\n\n[Chorus]\nSomebody's knockin'\nShould I let 'em in\nLord, we're just startin'\nBut where will it end\nSomebody's knockin'\nShould I let 'em in\nLord, we're just startin'\nBut where will it end\n\n[Verse 2: DMX & DMX as God]\nBut when the funds are low, the guns'll blow\nLookin' for that one that owe, make 'em run that dough\nNo! Put down the guns and write a new rhyme\nYou'll get it all in due time, you'll do fine, just have faith 'cause you mine\nAnd when you shine, it's gon' be a sight to behold\nSo don't fight to be old or lose sight when it's cold\nSee that light down the road? It's gon' to guide you there\nTwo sets of footprints; I was right beside you there\nBut what about them times I only saw one?\nThose were the times when I was under the gun, It was then I carried you my son\nLed you to safety, it just wasn't your time to face me (uh huh)\nAyo, a few of them times I thought you would erase me\nWhen all you did was embrace me, prepared me for the worst\nOffered me eternal life and scared me with the hearse\nAnd the curse turned to grace when the hurt turned to faith\nNo more runnin' or slidin' in the dirt, 'cause I'm safe\n\n[Chorus]\nSomebody's knockin'\nShould I let 'em in\nLord we're just startin'\nBut where will it end\nSomebody's knockin'\nShould I let 'em in\nLord we're just startin'\nBut where will it end\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo if I'm your man, I'm in your hands, what's your plan\nNever had a friend 'cause you couldn't trust your man\nLearned to stand before I crawled, things were twisted\nAnd if you showed me anything at all, then I missed it\nLooked the wrong way, I've done some wrong things\nKept a bad attitude, but that's what wrong brings\nAnd now you mean to tell me that after all this time\nIt was you that kept the dog from goin' out of my mind?\nIt was you that breathed life into my lungs when I was born?\nAnd it was you that let me know what was right from what was wrong?\nAnd it was you that let me do, what I knew what could be done?\nAnd it was you that gave me a good wife and a beautiful son?\nAnd it's been you speakin' to me inside my mind?\nAnd it's been you who has forgiven time after time?\nIt was you who opened my eyes so I could see?\nAnd it was you that shined your light on me?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8314b41ccd0d9cc7825bc168024bdec2.630x630x1.jpg", "artist": "DMX", "raw": {"annotation_count": 24, "api_path": "/songs/17467", "apple_music_id": "1085328783", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/17467/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "\u201cThe Convo\u201d was labeled an \u201cabsolution poem\u201d by Vibe Magazine\u2026 and rightfully so.

1: DMX & DMX as God]\nYou tell me that there's love here, but to me it's blatant\nThat with all the blood here, I'm dealin' with Satan\nPlus with all the hatin', it's hard to keep peace (uh huh)\nThou shall not steal, but I will to eat\nI tried doin' good, but good's not too good for me\nMisunderstood, why you chose the hood for me?\nMe? I'm aight; I just had to work hard at it\nWent to grandma for the answer and she told me that God had it\nSo now here I am, confused and full of questions\nAm I born to lose or is this just a lesson?\nAnd who is gon' choose when it gets turned around\nAnd will it be laying in my own blood and on the ground?\nMy child, I've watched you grow up and I've been there\nEven at those times you least suspected it, I was there\nAnd look at what I've given you - a talent to rhyme\nI may not come when you call, but I'm always on time\n\n[Chorus]\nSomebody's knockin'\nShould I let 'em in\nLord, we're just startin'\nBut where will it end\nSomebody's knockin'\nShould I let 'em in\nLord, we're just startin'\nBut where will it end\n\n[Verse 2: DMX & DMX as God]\nBut when the funds are low, the guns'll blow\nLookin' for that one that owe, make 'em run that dough\nNo! Put down the guns and write a new rhyme\nYou'll get it all in due time, you'll do fine, just have faith 'cause you mine\nAnd when you shine, it's gon' be a sight to behold\nSo don't fight to be old or lose sight when it's cold\nSee that light down the road? It's gon' to guide you there\nTwo sets of footprints; I was right beside you there\nBut what about them times I only saw one?\nThose were the times when I was under the gun, It was then I carried you my son\nLed you to safety, it just wasn't your time to face me (uh huh)\nAyo, a few of them times I thought you would erase me\nWhen all you did was embrace me, prepared me for the worst\nOffered me eternal life and scared me with the hearse\nAnd the curse turned to grace when the hurt turned to faith\nNo more runnin' or slidin' in the dirt, 'cause I'm safe\n\n[Chorus]\nSomebody's knockin'\nShould I let 'em in\nLord we're just startin'\nBut where will it end\nSomebody's knockin'\nShould I let 'em in\nLord we're just startin'\nBut where will it end\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo if I'm your man, I'm in your hands, what's your plan\nNever had a friend 'cause you couldn't trust your man\nLearned to stand before I crawled, things were twisted\nAnd if you showed me anything at all, then I missed it\nLooked the wrong way, I've done some wrong things\nKept a bad attitude, but that's what wrong brings\nAnd now you mean to tell me that after all this time\nIt was you that kept the dog from goin' out of my mind?\nIt was you that breathed life into my lungs when I was born?\nAnd it was you that let me know what was right from what was wrong?\nAnd it was you that let me do, what I knew what could be done?\nAnd it was you that gave me a good wife and a beautiful son?\nAnd it's been you speakin' to me inside my mind?\nAnd it's been you who has forgiven time after time?\nIt was you who opened my eyes so I could see?\nAnd it was you that shined your light on me?"}}, {"title": "Angel", "album": "...And Then There Was X", "year": "1999-12-21", "lyrics": "[Intro: Regina Bell harmonizing while DMX speaks]\nWhat good is it for a man to gain the world\nYet lose his own soul in the process?\nGod loves you, yes he does, said you're alright with him\nI wonder\u2026\n\n[Chorus: Regina Bell]\nI know you've never seen him\nBut don't fight with him\nYou're gonna make it through the night\nTo the light with him\nYou're alright with him\nI said you're alright with him\nI know you've never seen him\nBut don't fight with him\nYou're gonna make it through the night\nTo the light with him\nYou're alright with him\nI said you're alright with him\n\n[Verse 1: DMX]\nI'm callin' out to you, Lord, because I need your help\nSee, once again I'm havin' difficulty savin' myself\nBehavin' myself, you told me what to do, and I do it\nBut every and now and then it gets a little harder to go through it\nLosin' friends day by day\nI'm in so much pain when I'm here, Lord, please take me away!\nI put you here to do a job, and your work ain't done\nTo live is to suffer, but you're still my son\nAnd there will be a time when you shine as bright as the stars\nBut there won't be a his or hers, just ours\nThen you'll see what I've been tryin' to show you all these years\nDo the right thing, 'cause after the tears come the cheers\nI will, my Lord, with my heart and my soul\nThat's gonna be how I roll, from now until I mold\nLead and I'll follow, you take away the sorrow\nI'ma sleep on what you said and holla back tomorrow\n\n[Chorus: Regina Bell]\nI know you've never seen him\nBut don't fight with him\nYou're gonna make it through the night\nTo the light with him\nUhh, you're alright with him\nI said you're alright with him\nI know you've never seen him\nBut don't fight with him\nYou're gonna make it through the night\nTo the light with him\nUhh, you're alright with him\nI said you're alright with him\n\n[Verse 2: DMX]\nI want you to know, Lord, that for what you given me I'm thankful\nSincerely, from the bottom of my heart, I'm grateful\nYou gave us power in our words, so I think before I speak\nAnd that way when I speak, they know I'm here to teach\nCan't tell 'em nothin' wrong, 'cause I love 'em too much\nI reach a lot of people, and Lord, I'm lovin' the touch\nBut deep inside, I've got somethin' that's workin' against\nEverything I know is right, what I know makes sense\nThat's when you must fight harder than you've ever fought before\n'Cause what you've got goin' on inside you is a war\nBetween good and evil, be careful of those who wanna be you\nThey smile but are not really happy when they see you\nBe careful of the ones that always wanna get you high\n'Cause when the time comes, that one'll let you die\nListen to me!

lose his own soul in the process?\nGod loves you, yes he does, said you're alright with him\nI wonder\u2026\n\n[Chorus: Regina Bell]\nI know you've never seen him\nBut don't fight with him\nYou're gonna make it through the night\nTo the light with him\nYou're alright with him\nI said you're alright with him\nI know you've never seen him\nBut don't fight with him\nYou're gonna make it through the night\nTo the light with him\nYou're alright with him\nI said you're alright with him\n\n[Verse 1: DMX]\nI'm callin' out to you, Lord, because I need your help\nSee, once again I'm havin' difficulty savin' myself\nBehavin' myself, you told me what to do, and I do it\nBut every and now and then it gets a little harder to go through it\nLosin' friends day by day\nI'm in so much pain when I'm here, Lord, please take me away!\nI put you here to do a job, and your work ain't done\nTo live is to suffer, but you're still my son\nAnd there will be a time when you shine as bright as the stars\nBut there won't be a his or hers, just ours\nThen you'll see what I've been tryin' to show you all these years\nDo the right thing, 'cause after the tears come the cheers\nI will, my Lord, with my heart and my soul\nThat's gonna be how I roll, from now until I mold\nLead and I'll follow, you take away the sorrow\nI'ma sleep on what you said and holla back tomorrow\n\n[Chorus: Regina Bell]\nI know you've never seen him\nBut don't fight with him\nYou're gonna make it through the night\nTo the light with him\nUhh, you're alright with him\nI said you're alright with him\nI know you've never seen him\nBut don't fight with him\nYou're gonna make it through the night\nTo the light with him\nUhh, you're alright with him\nI said you're alright with him\n\n[Verse 2: DMX]\nI want you to know, Lord, that for what you given me I'm thankful\nSincerely, from the bottom of my heart, I'm grateful\nYou gave us power in our words, so I think before I speak\nAnd that way when I speak, they know I'm here to teach\nCan't tell 'em nothin' wrong, 'cause I love 'em too much\nI reach a lot of people, and Lord, I'm lovin' the touch\nBut deep inside, I've got somethin' that's workin' against\nEverything I know is right, what I know makes sense\nThat's when you must fight harder than you've ever fought before\n'Cause what you've got goin' on inside you is a war\nBetween good and evil, be careful of those who wanna be you\nThey smile but are not really happy when they see you\nBe careful of the ones that always wanna get you high\n'Cause when the time comes, that one'll let you die\nListen to me! I'm here, but I can only help you\nIf you want me to help, what do you want for yourself?\n\n[Chorus: Regina Bell]\nI know you've never seen him\nBut don't fight with him\nYou're gonna make it through the night\nTo the light with him\nYou're alright with him\nI said you're alright with him\nI know you've never seen him\nBut don't fight with him\nYou're gonna make it through the night\nTo the light with him\nYou're alright with him\nI said you're alright with him\n\n[Verse 3: DMX]\nMy Lord, my savior, don't judge my behavior, but instead\nTake what's in my heart and put it in my head\nSee, I guess I really never knew how proud I made you\nMy life is yours, my soul I gave you\nI don't know if I'll do good enough (He's by your side)\nAnd we both know the hood is rough (Right by your side)\nSometimes I don't know what to do (X, dry your eyes!)\nBut I know what I gotta do (It'll be alright)\nYou keep givin' me the word, and I'll put it to song\nTalk to me, I'll talk to them, and we can't go wrong\nThis is the start of somethin' strong, and this is just the start of it\nPraises to you, my Lord, for lettin' me be a part of it\nI was that kid that, been there, did that\nBecame ashamed so I hid that, but ain't no longer with that\nUse me as an example\u2014if I can do it, then they can too\nWith the Lord behind us, there ain't nothin' that we can't do\n\n[Chorus: Regina Bell]\nI know you've never seen him\nBut don't fight with him\nYou're gonna make it through the night\nTo the light with him (The light with him)\nYou're alright with him ('Cause he loves you)\nI said you're alright with him\nI know you've never seen him\nBut don't fight with him\nYou're gonna make it through the night\nTo the light with him\nUhh, you're alright with him ('Cause he loves you)\nI said you're alright with him\n\n[Outro: Regina Bell]\nHe's by your side\nRight by your side\nX, dry your eyes!\n'Cause it'll be alright\nYeah, he's by your side\nRight by your side\nX, dry your eyes!\n'Cause, it's gonna be alright\nYeah yeah, yes it is!"}}, {"title": "A'Yo Kato", "album": "Grand Champ", "year": "2003-09-16", "lyrics": "[DMX]\nHuh, This go out to my dog Kato, rest in piece baby\n\nDogs that I call my friends\nPraying for all my friends\nThings I do for my friends\nWe miss you!

you and the lord (aight)\nDon't know when I'm coming, but keep checking the door (aight)\nBut while I'm here, knock on wood\nI'll make sure that your kids remember who their father was\nAnd Val is

fight\nOver some dick that they don't even own\nAll I'm givin' them is the bone\nBlowin' up a niggas phone, but ain't nobody home (damn)\nI'm in the zone, tryna do things\nLet's turn this into a crew thing -- whassup girlfriend, you game?\nDon't wonder why when I leave at night\nIt's because I thieve at night\nI'm leavin' bitches not breathin' right\nI fuck they head up with some slick shit\nHit

DMX]\nIt's all good, it's alright\nFuck all day, fuck all night\nCall my bitches, 'cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches\nEast to the West coast, all my bitches\n\n[Verse 1: DMX]\nYo, chickens is good for pluckin', so I'm stickin' bitches, fuckin'\nGot 'em trickin' while they suckin', give em dick and they be buggin'\nI've done it all - from mackin two hoes on a three-way\nDominican hoes on B-way, country hoes in V-A\nAnd they all say the same about my game it's tight\nThat's why every night a different group of bitches start a fight\nOver some dick that they don't even own\nAll I'm givin' them is the bone\nBlowin' up a niggas phone, but ain't nobody home (damn)\nI'm in the zone, tryna do things\nLet's turn this into a crew thing -- whassup girlfriend, you game?\nDon't wonder why when I leave at night\nIt's because I thieve at night\nI'm leavin' bitches not breathin' right\nI fuck they head up with some slick shit\nHit 'em off with some long dick shit\nMake it some quick shit, but rip shit\nThen I'm out, just like the trash on a Thursday\nKnowin' she'd be givin' up the ass on the first date\n\n[Chorus: DMX]\nIt's all good, it's alright\nFuck all day, fuck all night\nCall my bitches, 'cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches\nEast to the West coast, all my bitches\nIt's all good, it's alright\nFuck all day, fuck all night\nCall my bitches, 'cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches\nEast to the West coast, all my bitches\n\n[Verse 2: DMX]\nFlocks of bitches by the dozens, from sisters to cousins\nGot 'em doin' shit they said they wasn't ever gonna do\nLike knowin' I'd fuck the bitch that she was close to\nStill gave up the ass and dough, she was supposed to (what?)\nPictures of bitches and flicks of chicks\nVideos with the baddest hoes, suckin' dick\nIt's the dog in me, that makes me do wrong\nAnd honeys can't help but get strung (why?)\n'Cause the game is too strong (okay)\nI like 'em greedy, black like Edi\nEyes beady, willin' to give to the needy\nI done ran through 'em all, from around the way bitches\nTo them outta state hoes, and even hittin' gay bitches\nAll I tell 'em is, \"Let me get that,\" then it's on\nKnock her motherfuckin' boots, and then I'm gone\nI got the white bitches sayin', \"It's a black thing!\"\n'Cause I leave that ho with no dough and plenty of back pain\n\n[Chorus: DMX]\nIt's all good, it's alright\nFuck all day, fuck all night\nCall my bitches, 'cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches\nEast to the West coast, all my bitches\nIt's all good, it's alright\nFuck all day, fuck all night\nCall my bitches, 'cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches\nEast to the West coast, all my bitches\n\n[Verse 3: DMX]\nBitches who get props, 'cause they know who can get got\nAnd they can get shot, by the way a niggas lip drop\nWalk up in the spot, knowin' what she want strictly\nWhen hon wants the dickly, hon comes and gets me\nHits me, pays me, doesn't get crazy\nKnows to be Swayze, 'cause that's daddy's baby\nI keep them hoes in check, like the government\nHittin' 'em off with nothin' but the dick, and they lovin' it!\nHuggin' it, like it's they best friend, 'cause it is\nWord to Miz, fuckin' with tricks is just biz\nI deal with strictly dimes\nGot 'em committin' they first crimes\nNow she suckin' dick, for the first time\nAnd ain't no secret, 'bout how I freak it, when they sleep\nDidn't never know how I peeped it, then creeped it\nThat's how I know this must be that shit\nI tell them bitches, \"I'll be back,\" and they believe that shit!\n\n[Chorus: DMX]\nIt's all good, it's alright\nFuck all day, fuck all night\nCall my bitches, 'cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches\nEast to the West coast, all my bitches\nIt's all good, it's alright\nFuck all day, fuck all night\nCall my bitches, 'cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches\nEast to the West coast, all my bitches\nIt's all good, it's alright\nFuck all day, fuck all night\nCall my bitches, 'cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches\nEast to the West coast, all my bitches\nIt's all good, it's alright\nFuck all day, fuck all night\nCall my bitches, 'cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches\nEast to the West coast, all my bitches\n\n[Outro: DMX]\nI

chain\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nI be that youngin with that gun that\u2019s tellin' ya stop frontin'\nI be that yougin on the run after I pop somethin'\nIn the Bible I read death is of the tongue\nAnd if you talk about death enough death is gon' come\nJay taught me how to flow, they shot him in the head\nRandy ass was there, now he runnin' scared\nSome say I'm gangsta, some say I'm crazy\nIf you ask me I'll say I'm what the hood made me\nNow I can stunt 'til my ass dead broke like JD\nOr put a hundred grand on every nigga head that play me\nSee I'm cool with them Haitian mob niggas\nThey say ''Sak pase Nap boule'' and rob niggas\nThe media be tryin' to make a nigga look bad, what's with that?\nSee my flick next to Preme, Papi and Cat\nAnd Montana, I kill 'em with the grammar\nI enhanced in the slammer after bangin them hammers\nX, what up? (Aight)\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nYou don't live that, you shouldn't say that\nCause what come out your mouth'll get you shot down\nThrowin' your money around and we don't play that\nGetting in our line'll get you shot down\nWe know where you hang, we know where you stay at\nThat bullshit you on'll get you shot down\nHere's a few cliques that you shouldn't play with\nG-Unit, Ruff Ryders'll get you shot down\n\n[Verse 2: DMX]\nFuck y'all niggas talkin' 'bout, think you playin' with?\nDouble R, G-Unit, the same old shit\nPut the faggots in the ring, watch 'em all quit\nAll y'all niggas is pussy, suck my dick\nAin't nothin' but a handful of man still standin'\nI remember 50 in a cypher when Onyx was \"Slammin\"\nNow we meet again, it's all good, my nigga\nBack to the street again, it's all hood, my nigga\nKnock on wood, my nigga, we both walk the dog\nWe ain't get to where we at by luck, shit was hard\nBut once we got through the trials it's all smiles\n'Til a big type nigga all of a sudden get wild\nNow why you gotsta go and take me back to where I came from?\nI'mma make you remember where you know my name from\n45th Street, and blaow-blaow Ave\nI done ran through your crew and only let off half, nigga\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nYou don't live that, you shouldn't say that\nCause what come out your mouth'll get you shot down\nThrowin' your money around and we don't play that\nGetting in our line'll get you shot down\nWe know where you hang, we know where you stay at\nThat bullshit you on'll get you shot down\nHere's a few cliques that you shouldn't play with\nG-Unit, Ruff Ryders'll get you shot down\n\n[Verse 3: Styles P]\nIf your head ain't off of your shoulders\nYou ain't get shot, you got nicked nigga (just nicked)\nCause if my chrome hit a piece of your bone\nIt's gon' do more than chip, nigga (a lot more than that)\nYeah, what the fuck is the problem?\nThe Porsche is red, the buckets is army\n30 shot handguns, the gutter is starvin\nNiggas like me might rush your apartment\nBloodstains'll fuck up your carpet, brain on the window\nI smell murder every time that the wind blow\nTie him to the chair and then knock out his chinbone\nI don\u2019t want the throne or the crown, I ain\u2019t sell enough\nYou can have the jail or the ground, you ain't in hell enough\nI'm the one that flood the gutters\nBetter tap your man and let him know P'll love to cut his\nAnd niggas is gettin shot down, two guns up\nDouble R, S.P., holdin' D Block down\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nYou don't live that, you shouldn't say that\nCause what come out your mouth'll get you shot down\nThrowin' your money around and we don't play that\nGetting in our line'll get you shot down\nWe know where you hang, we know where you stay at\nThat bullshit you on'll get you shot down\nHere's

dog at the bottom looking up, now what's that?\nYour worst nightmare 'cause I take it right there\nYou got niggas coming? Where they at? Right where?\nI make 'em like air, floating away\nWouldn't tell what he was thinking so I opened a way\nLeft him broken away, you know he hurt before he died\nMakes you wonder if he lost his shirt before he died\nOnly two knew the answer and one of us is dead\nSo anyone who seeks the truth can get it straight to head\nThen you and him can discuss what I did\nYeah it was wrong, dog, but I slid\nI'll repent one day, just not right now\nYou hear my shit all on the street, I'm kinda hot right now\nCome on\n\n[Hook]\nI don't give a fuck about\nY'all niggas cause y'all ain killing nothing\nI don't give a fuck about\nY'all niggas cause y'all ain killing nothing\n\n[Verse 2]\nI wanna break bread wit' the cats that I starve with\nWanna hit the malls with the same dogs I rob with\nWanna be able to laugh with the niggas that I cried with\nWhen it's over be like these is the niggas that I died with\nWhat do you do when you find out in the hall there's a rat?\nWhat do you do when you find out that your dog is a cat?\nShit, all niggas pack, can't hold but two\nSo while you getting more gats I'm putting holes in you\nA snubnose will do, break 'em off real propa'\nNeed to keep spittin' and I ain't gonna stoppa'\nCocka, unlocka, let'em go!\nGive it to his man, just to let him know\nAll things considered it was real for' a minute\nGot what was yours and tried to steal something with it\nNow feel something hit it, your chest that is\nThe best that is, is probably the best that slid\nDon't stress that kid!\n\n[Hook]\nI don't give a fuck about\nY'all niggas cause y'all ain killing nothing\nI don't give a fuck about\nY'all niggas cause y'all ain killing nothing\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhen niggas hear that dog bark, they better run\nWhen police hear that dog bark, they better come\nThey expect to save their lives, but they lives will be lost\nThere is a price to pay, how many lives will it cost? (come on)\nSince I run with the devil, I am one with the devil\nAnd I stay doing dirt so I'm a come with the shovel\nIs you on a level of a madman whose mind's twisted?\nMad niggas dreams caught the last train, mine's missed it\nListed as a manic-depressive with extreme paranoia\nHey dog, I got something for ya\nHear my name, feel my pain\nNiggas wanna steal my fame, but first, feel my reign\nKnow what it's like to suffer, never have enough of\nShit, starting off hard then only getting rougher!\nTougher, but then came the grease\nSo if you wanna save the peace, tame the beast"}}, {"title": "One More Road to Cross", "album": "...And Then There Was X", "year": "1999-12-21", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nUhh, this is life (this is life)\nThis is what I know (this what I know)\nSo to me (so to me)\nThis is life (this is life)\n\n[Chorus]\nOne more road to cross\nOne more risk to take\nGotta live my life\nLike there's one more move to make\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm up at like 6AM to check this nigga\nHe work the nightshift and I gots to check them figures\nKnock on his door, peoples talkin' 'bout, \"He ain't there.\"\nBut the house is packed, shit I know he here somewhere\nSee, money get high, I don't knock what a nigga do to get by\nJust make sure you gettin' by don't fuck with you gettin' mine\nAin't the first time he ran off, shoulda split his shit then\nHate to think of what he's did and if I catch him slippin'\nWon't be an ass-whippin, I can tell you that\nI keep it real with this cat, he go and sell two packs\nAnd run off (damn) tell me he was locked down up North\nAnd you out a week later? That's bullshit!

We got a hero, shoot that nigga!\nMatter of fact, you hit the back, I'll put two in that nigga\nHard-head motherfuckas always get it\nI told him what would happen if he moved\nThat nigga moved so I did it\n\"Did you get it?\" I asked my man as he was comin' from the back\nNigga opened his mouth, said nothin' and fell out flat\nThis cat come out spittin', hittin' my mans, his mans\nCouldn't control what was in his hands\nI'm hit, damn! I bust back and got the fuck up outta there\nDidn't get a dime, but at least I got up outta there\n\n[Chorus]\nOne more road to cross\nOne more risk to take\nGotta live my life\nLike there's one more move to make\n\n[Verse 3]\nAyo I see it, try to avoid it, but it comes\nThat's how it's goin' in the slums over crumbs\nSomethin' little becomes somethin' major\nNiggas gettin' blown up like a pager, ear to ear with the razor\nPour out my soul, took control of hurt\nWhy must Earl Simmons swim in dirt?\nI'm gon' make it work, 28 and tryna get baptized\nPriest scared to touch me 'cause he said I gave him bad vibes\nRide when I die, straight down but I'm plottin'\nWe all gots to go, but who wants to be forgotten?\nI'ma leave a mark and it won't be the mark of the devil\nThrow dirt and may your hands burn when you touch the shovel\nThe level of animosity is stoppin' me from thrivin'\nFuck what them niggas is talkin' about, I'm survivin'\nAlive and goin' through it, but I made my bed\nSo now it's in these flames that I lay my head\n\n[Chorus]\nOne more road to cross\nOne more risk to take\nGotta live my life\nLike there's one more move to make", "image":

think that the two would go good\nMidtown honey, nigga from the hood\nBut knock on wood, I got this bitch (what?) excuse me\nShe don't like to be called a bitch, try not to lose me\nThe rules we go by, where I'm from, she don't know\nWhen I say I'm goin around the way, she won't go\n(Hell no) C'mon baby, you aight with me\nTryin to get you, to spend the whole night with me\n(But I'm a good girl) Uhh, that's why I like her\nCouldn't treat her like a hoodrat, didn't bite her\nTurn a church girl to a straight Ruff Ryder\nTake her to the Ramada make it an all nighter\n(Oh no, I only go to the Swiss hotel)\nFuckin with me? I have you in the back of the Chevelle\nLike what (what) hittin it raw dogg in the butt\nYou was good this mornin, but tonight you a slut\n\nChorus: DMX (Dyme)\n\nWhy do (good girls) like bad guys\nKnowin that bad guys tell mad lies?\n(And why do) dog niggas (want a honey wit class?)\n(Sometimes you want more than just a honey wit ass)\nHey yo Boo, why do (good girls) like bad guys\nKnowin that bad guys tell mad lies?\n(Then why do) dog niggas (want a honey wit class?)\n(Sometimes you want more than just a honey wit ass)\n\n[Dyme]\nHey yo Boo, I'm diggin you, cause you make me wanna do\nAll them things I was taught I wasn't supposed to\nI'm secure, keep it tight while you on tour\n(You fuckin wit a dog!)

Make me backflip\n(You been tryin to act, rich, that's why I taxed you\nAnd I just got married) Hell, but I ain't even ask you\n(I'm just tellin you, cause nowadays, bitches be flippin)\nOne more bitch, I'm skippin (Damn girl, stop trippin)\nCause you be actin like\n(Listen, I ain't always talkin money\nBut I will keep you wit a smile, and walkin funny\nSo what's it gon' be?) Yo, what you mean? (What to do?\nYou want the nigga wit the slacks, or the jeans and the boots?\nYou wanna be safe or be laced, cause you can be replaced)\nYeah, you can be erased\n(Don't get slapped, babyface)\n\nChorus\n\n[DMX]\nMan, I got shorty stayin out late (Well I keep him wit a cut\nAnd his nails stay clean) At least I get a nut\nAnd I got honey rebellin (And I stopped him from sellin)\nI be gettin away with murder, right?

heartless\n\n[Verse 1]\nWho is this I see, coming through, its like 3 in the a.m\nI'ma rob this nigga, and when I'm done, I'ma slay him\nFor being stupid like, comin' through after 1 or 2\nAnd havin' a gun that he couldn't get to, yeah, that one'll do\nFoolish niggas learn the hard way, then I teach 'em\nBe in the wrong place at the wrong time, then I leach 'em\nLike Jigga said, niggas test you when your gun goes warm\nSo I keep 'em scattering like roaches, when the light turns off\nFrom night to dawn, right from wrong holds no weight\n3-57 slugs with a snub nose, dray eight\nSettin' all you bitches straight (what) squashing all beefs\nTo the point where the police be blockin' all streets\nGot me trapped up in the building, but you know how that go\nI stay fucking with the hood rats and I run up in the rab hole\nRun through the hallway, see police, face to face\nAnd being I'm telling you this story, means I caught another case\n\n[Interlude]\nIts either you or me\nAnd more than likely, its gonna be you, than me\nAiight? Feel me, O\n\n[Verse 2]\nDay 2 of the saga, this fucking drama continues\nWaking up like every 2 hours, looking out my window\nPlus I keep the 4-4 pointed at the door just in case\nWhen they bust in, I bust them and I'm gunning for the face\n\"What a waste of potential\" is what my teachers used to tell me\n\"You can always get a job\" and cheap shit they tried to sell me\nGot me no where but broke and fucked up in the game\nBut now I got a name, and niggas know my name\nKnock of the door \"Police! We're looking for a man\nKilled a couple of cops last night and the reward is ten grand\"\nI play like a bitch \"Its just me here, and I'm not dressed\nAnd that guy sounds kind of dangerous, I hope you make an arrest\"\nThat was a close one, now I know I gotta get outta the city\n'Cause I know I'm hotter than lava, I'll holla tomorrow\nGot my dog on the horn, he like \"Fuck, you done did?!\nThey done ran up in my crib, nigga, patting down my kid!\"\n(dial tone)\n\n[Verse 3]\nPut the harness on the dog, load up the weapons\nMurder's on my mind, no half steppin'\nMotherfuckers want war, you can get it\nCause I'm tired of running, remember me as the nigga that died gunning\nKamikaze mission, C-4 strapped to the chest\nRun up in that joint, raw dog; fuck the vest\nThey can keep theirs, cause it won't be the slugs that'll kill 'em\nIt'll be the roar of the C-4 as I'm bringing down the building\nWhen I go, taking a bunch of the motherfuckas with me\nI ain't sitting around waiting for them faggot niggas to come and get me\nI bring it to 'em, service with a smile; what nigga?\nDidn't know a dog with rabies was up in the cut, nigga?\nNow that you finally finding out what this shit means\nI'm at the precinct, 116th\nRun up in there, open up my jacket \"You motherfuckas looking for me?\"\n\"Well here I am! Now you coming with me!\"\n(Explosion)\n\n[Outro]\nMan, that shit is crazy, baby\nCan you dig it, can you dig it, can you feel it, is you with it\nIt's off the hook y'all"}}, {"title": "Dog Intro", "album": "Grand Champ", "year": "2003-09-16", "lyrics": "[Swizz Beatz whispers]\nRuff Ryders\nRide or die\nGet at these niggas dog\n\n[Man talking]\nYup, yup, yup\nI don't really trust humans that much these days\nShit, fact of the matter is, I trust dogs more than I trust humans\nShit, nothing like that dog love I tell ya\nNot just any dog, gotta be a pit bull\nYup, that's the only dog for me\nYou don't wanna get caught in a pit with one of them\nThey make good companions, but even worse enemies\nIt's all on how you take it\n\n[DMX verse]\nNothing goes down I don't get a small piece of\nGet the picture see the beauty in the beast of\nThe mad man, Mr. bad man is here\nCause a nigga like me smells wreck in the air\nIt just ain't fair, the shit that I be doing to niggas\nAnd get away with the same shit ruining niggas\nCover all ground and I roll thick like the fog\nOnly motha fuckin' friend I ever had was a dog\nNever ate the hog but glad to say I smoked plenty\nThe 5th Precinct to name one of many of'em\nIn one verse I beat you worse than your momma\nI fuck around and eat you first like Dahmer's\nI'ma, play that ass out like a bomber\nKilled a nigga once for looking like he wanted drama\nI'm buggin, the pain it hurts I gotta scream\nAHHHHH!\nLettin' off a little steam\nSociety was just too much, I couldn't hack it\nSix motha fuckin' years in a straight jacket\nYo black it wasn't wise for them to let me out the joint\nNever really got better so I'm not on point\nI just might flip, quick, but it's too late to be bitchin'\nGot more loose screws than the table in your kitchen\nI'm itchin', just hope you ain't around when I scratch\nCause like I said before, I eats what I catch\nSearchin' shit will have a nigga hurt and sick\nThe dirt you kick will get you in the dirt and quick\nWord to Miz, you niggas is kids, don't play\nI'm too old for the jokes you'll get smoked, I don't play\nI'm won't say what's gon' happen if you force my hand\nSomeone somewhere will be like \"I lost my man\"\nTake it to heart it's about to get dark so run that\nAll that shit niggas talking been there done that\nWhat black?

of\nGet the picture see the beauty in the beast of\nThe mad man, Mr. bad man is here\nCause a nigga like me smells wreck in the air\nIt just ain't fair, the shit that I be doing to niggas\nAnd get away with the same shit ruining niggas\nCover all ground and I roll thick like the fog\nOnly motha fuckin' friend I ever had was a dog\nNever ate the hog but glad to say I smoked plenty\nThe 5th Precinct to name one of many of'em\nIn one verse I beat you worse than your momma\nI fuck around and eat you first like Dahmer's\nI'ma, play that ass out like a bomber\nKilled a nigga once for looking like he wanted drama\nI'm buggin, the pain it hurts I gotta scream\nAHHHHH!\nLettin' off a little steam\nSociety was just too much, I couldn't hack it\nSix motha fuckin' years in a straight jacket\nYo black it wasn't wise for them to let me out the joint\nNever really got better so I'm not on point\nI just might flip, quick, but it's too late to be bitchin'\nGot more loose screws than the table in your kitchen\nI'm itchin', just hope you ain't around when I scratch\nCause like I said before, I eats what I catch\nSearchin' shit will have a nigga hurt and sick\nThe dirt you kick will get you in the dirt and quick\nWord to Miz, you niggas is kids, don't play\nI'm too old for the jokes you'll get smoked, I don't play\nI'm won't say what's gon' happen if you force my hand\nSomeone somewhere will be like \"I lost my man\"\nTake it to heart it's about to get dark so run that\nAll that shit niggas talking been there done that\nWhat black? Think it's an act? Then let me know\nBut he liked what I'm saying so shut the fuck up and let me flow\nYo you think it's a game? Keep playing\nThey gon' find your ass somewhere in a creek laying\nIt's over you just ain't laid down yet\nAnd in a minute you gon' be that motha fucka' that ain't found yet\nHold off from making movies and make moves\nStop talking about shit that you can't prove\nI'm the mountain you can't move, so why you trying\nLooking at me stupid wondering why you dying\nWhile you flying\nThrough the air with a big ass hole in your chest\nWishing you was holding a vest\nBut it's too late for wishing so all you getting is rest\nGo to sleep, pa pa will take care of the stress\nGod bless and may He have mercy on your soul\nPOP POP\nTake these two more with you on your stroll, nigga\n\n[DMX talking]\nYup, yup, yup\nI don't really trust humans that much these days\nShit, fact of the matter is, I trust dogs more than I trust humans\nShit, nothing like that dog love I tell ya\nNot just any dog, gotta be a pit bull\nYup, that's the only dog for me\nYou don't wanna get caught in a pit with one of them\nThey make good companions, but even worse enemies\nIt's all on how you take it\n\nYou know how we do baby\nAight\nGrand champ\nYou know how we do\nScratch all day, match our weight\nFuck nigga\nYou can't be fuckin' serious\nA raccoon ain't nothing but a big cat"}}, {"title": "ATF", "album": "It's Dark and Hell is Hot", "year": "1998-05-19", "lyrics": "[Intro: DMX]\nGot me on the run\nUh, uh\n\n[Verse: DMX]\nBOOM, BOOM, BOOM, open the door, ATF\nToo late to send my girl downstairs to say he left\nHit the basement, go through the replacement door\nCome up in my neighbor's yard, with a taste for war\nYou know I laced the four with the hollows\nCrack the safe, grab the bottles (What you want me to do?)

be heard\nGive me the light, 'cause all I need is the word\nGive me a life that I'm responsible for\nI'll give Him what's right, 'cause I'm responsible for Him\nAnd into the night, I'm gonna be there with Him\nFacin' a fight, I be right there with Him\nI'm ready for Heaven, 'cause I done been through the Hell\nAnd since I was seven, I've had a story to tell\nSee, God is great, and that's why I'm still livin'\nHe gave to me, so I'ma keep on givin'\nThe bravery of a man's mind in slavery\nIs makin' me the man I was made to be\nI hate to see when cats know but don't spit it\nRight is wrong, when it's on you gon' get it\n\n[Hook]\n(Right, wrong)\nWhatever which way they go (right, wrong)\nWhatever which way they go (right, wrong)\nWhatever which way they go (right, wrong)\nWhatever which way

didn't go right, You hit me like\u2014\nYou see, things ain't always what they seem to be\nAnd the reason I dream of thee is He's with me\nAnd the reason I get through things so easily\nIs by the grace of God 'cause He sees the need to guide me\nWalk right beside me\nBecause He knows what's goin' on inside me, He tried me\nKnew where my heart was at, knew what I was thinkin'\nKnew when I was down and out, left there stinkin'\nKnew when to pick me up 'cause it got too hard\nKnew when I was gonna scream out: \"Please God!\"\nAnd You already knew that You would be there for me\nThat's why I bring You together to give You the glory\n\n[Hook]\n(Right, wrong)\nWhatever which way they go (right, wrong)\nWhatever which way they go (right, wrong)\nWhatever which way they go (right,

me\nAin't no cats gon' bust slugs for me\nAin't no cats gon' shed blood for me\nBut my dogs is gon' be a thug wit me\nAin't no other cats got love for me\nAin't no cats gon' bust slugs for me\nAin't no cats gon' shed blood for me\nBut my dogs is gon' be a thug wit me\n\nUhh, uhh\n\n[Verse 1: DMX]\nIf I'm gonna rob, I'mma rob all night\nIf I'm lookin' for somethin' it's probably a fight\nIf I'm gon' fuck bitches then they better be tight\nIf that's dead, then the head better be right\nIf I gots to play I'mma play 'til I win\nSince I gots to be here can't wait to begin\nWanna fuck shorty, can't stand shorty friend\n'Cause honey friend fucked many, many men\nStay wit the rats 'cause the rats is real\nWanna fuck, then we fuck, already know the deal\nShit, fuck what you look like, just show the real\nAnd I keep spot that we can go to chill\nI love my, get down for the hoes\nOnly reason I come around is for the hoes\nPipework, I lay it down for the hoes\nHit 'em off with that dark brown, you know?\n\n[Chorus: DMX]\nAin't no other cats got love for me\nAin't no cats gon' bust slugs for me\nAin't no cats gon' shed blood for me\nBut my dogs is gon' be a thug wit me\nAin't no other cats got love for me\nAin't no cats gon' bust slugs for me\nAin't no cats gon' shed blood for me\nBut my dogs is gon' be a thug wit me\n\n[Verse 2: Drag-On]\nY'know fuckin' wit me, ain't keepin' your health right\n'Cause me and my boys, we keep it jail tight\nThe shit I pack is heavy, but the shell's light\nWhen they drop the same time, you drop without a fight\nBurnin' anything that I'm puttin' my name on\nYou might take a 'Drag', but you can't flame 'On'\nI know y'all niggas don't owe me with a chain on\nWhen it come to the fire I'm the kid they blame it on\nWhen you see like eight cars then y'all know who we are\nNiggas spittin' mean bars off the green jar\nNever drunk but you see me leaned at the bar\nSpittin' fire that'll melt the ice on your arm\nYou had that but for now dog give me that\n'Cause dog you don't wanna see how my semi act\nFake hustlin' niggas, you'll pump any pack\nWhen it come to this shit, I done laid plenty flat (C'MON!)\n\n[Chorus: DMX]\nAin't no other cats got love for me\nAin't no cats gon' bust slugs for me\nAin't no cats gon' shed blood for me\nBut my dogs is gon' be a thug wit me\nAin't no other cats got love for me\nAin't no cats gon' bust slugs for me\nAin't no cats gon' shed blood for me\nBut my dogs is gon' be a thug wit me\n\n[Bridge: DMX]\nDo you hear what I tell you? Understand what you hear\nDon't let nobody tell you, what to hope and to fear\nDo you hear what I tell you? Understand what you hear\nDon't let nobody tell you, what to hope and to fear\n\nUhh, uhh\n\n[Verse 3: DMX]\nWhat you niggas want? 'Cause I got it right here\nY'all niggas front, then I hit you right there\nNot really impressed by what niggas wear\nFaggots talk shit but I really don't care\nI'm the type of nigga that'll die for the cause\nFuck what you heard, I will die for my dogs\nAin't scared of shit, will ride in the fog\nSame thing but a bigger size than yours\nI fuck with Drag-On, 'cause he spits the flame\nDrag-On motherfucker don't forget the name\nAnd we all takin' over, ain't shit the same\nIf you ain't out that mob nigga quit the game\nAnd ain't no other cats got love for me\nAin't no other cats gon' bust slugs for me\nAin't no other cats gon' shed blood for me\nBut my dogs is gon' be a thug wit me, c'mon!\n\n[Chorus: DMX]\nAin't no other cats got love for me\nAin't no cats gon' bust slugs for me\nAin't no cats gon' shed blood for me\nBut my dogs, is gon' be a thug wit me\nAin't no other cats got love for me\nAin't no cats gon' bust slugs for me\nAin't no cats gon' shed blood for me\nBut my dogs, is gon' be a thug wit me\n\n[Bridge: DMX]\nDo you hear what I tell you?

fight me off the map with a new song\nMan you know you wrong, trying that shit there\nYeah a nigga went there, all you do is sit there\nI've been rapping for 20 years and you 20 years old\nX back on the block nigga if you go bold\nThere's a new sheriff in town, just been re-elected\nYou ain't gonna like it, but respect, nigga check it\nI'mma get it in till the nigga wins with the dividends\nWe gon' walk these dogs 'til the bitter end\nYou like, oh it's him again, I knew that's how you felt\nPussy, I knew that's how you smelt\nBut you cats still playing around with just beats\nTalking about what you got, ain't air in the teeth\nYou can put on a vest, but I'mma still stop it\nCause I got a chopper that sound like a helicopter\nAnd niggas really don't want me to pop the trunk\nWe gon' either chop or slump when I cock and dump\nWhether the Glock or pump, cats ain't ready\nHalf from here to here, lookin like spaghetti\nPull out the machete, hack off the limbs\nBag up the pieces, wipe off the Timbs\nJump in the Benz, five cars deep\n4 o'clock in the morning, riders still asleep\nShut shit down whenever we hit town\nGIVE A NIGGA PASS! I lay my dick down\nYou can, bring out the best or, bring out the worst\nYou gon' bring out the worst, we gon' bring out the hearse\nNiggas play poker, I play poke-her\nHit her from ear to ear make her smile like The Joker!"}}, {"title": "Last Hope", "album": "The Weigh In", "year": "2012-05-15", "lyrics": "[Intro: DMX]\nThey do it every time man\nEvery time\nEvery time they do it to me\n\n[Hook

music\n\n[Hook]\nKeep (Yeah!) your head (What!) to the sky (Uh, uh, uh, uh, come on!)\nKeep (Yeah!) your head (What!) to the sky (Uh, uh, uh, uh)\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhen I think I don\u2019t deserve it, I think about Jesus\nAnd the fact that he was perfect and he thinks that I\u2019m worth it\nI know I got a purpose, so when I don\u2019t like what I see in the mirror\nI learn to look past the surface\nBelieve me God heard this, 'cause these words came from my heart\nI was in pain, it was dark\nThen came the spark to light down the road\nTo let me know that he would lighten up my load\nAnd it\u2019s gon\u2019 get greater, later\nGod only wants the best for me, but the devil\u2019s a hater\nI can see his eyes through the smiles of fake friends\nIf y'all think hate wins... just keep waitin'\nAt the end of the day who\u2019s will will you think will prevail\nOr will you live to tell\nMiracle after miracle it comes through\nThe spiritual individual is in you\n\n[Hook]\nKeep (Yeah!) your head (What!) to the sky (Uh, uh, uh, uh, come on!)\nKeep (Yeah!) your head (What!) to the sky (Uh, uh, uh, uh)\n\n[Verse 2]\nLord if you hear me, You know that I\u2019m comin' to You sincerely\nI need You near me, please feel me\nI\u2019m sick and I need for You to heal me\nI\u2019m lost and lookin' for the real me, I\u2019m tired and weary\nHaven\u2019t been able to see things clearly\nAnd even though I know You love me dearly, I still get leery\nSo where does that leave me? Lost and alone\nI wanna call God but it\u2019s like I lost my phone\nEvery day is a struggle, 'cause I juggle my problems\nNeed to let go and let God, 'cause only he could solve 'em\nI'm tired of lyin' to myself, thinkin' I could do it on my own\nBut when I get left alone\nThat's when the devil sneaks in and creeps in\nKnocks on the door lightly then peeks in\nAnd it\u2019s usually around the weekends\nThat I get reckless and jump off the deep end (Come on)\n\n[Hook]\nKeep (Yeah!) your head (What!) to the sky (Uh, uh, uh, uh, come on!)\nKeep (Yeah!) your head (What!) to the sky (Uh, uh, uh, uh)"}}, {"title": "Some X Shit", "album": "Ryde or Die Vol. 1", "year": "1999-04-27", "lyrics": "[Left and right DMX parts simultaneous]\nWhoo whoo!

Blige]\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\nWhere would I go?\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\nWhere would I go?\n-Gotta keep it real with me\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\nWhere would I go?\n-So the hell with you\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\nWhere would I go?\n-I think I'm going to the top\nMe and DMX\n\n[DMX]\nI will spend mad time in one spot, plottin' my next move\nTryna figure out - why is it, that X do what X do\nSome questions go unanswered (why?), that's what I'm afraid of\nSometimes I can't show, but I know what I'm made of\nThey made love, or should I say they made lust\nBound, there didn't have to be love there, but they made us\nI got quite a few sisters, I was the only boy\nBut bein' with my dog, was my only joy\nLike a kid with a new toy, I forgot about the grime\nEscaped the misery, didn't think about the crime\nLost all track of time, was in another world\nEverybody knew Earl, but there was another Earl\nLighter side of the dark, fight in the park but wouldn't wanna\n[?] But when they jumped me, became a good runner\nOne by one they all went under, so I had the last laugh\nThey all thought it all was a joke, but I had the last laugh\n\n[Mary J. Blige]\nHa ha ha ha ha ha\n[DMX]\nCome on!\n\n[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\n-If I don't know, I don't know\nWhere would I go?\n-Where would I go?\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\nWhere would I go?\n-Where we going, where we going, where we going?\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\n-Where I'm going\nWhere would I go?\n-But I know where I'm going\nIf I don't know where I'm coming from\n-Do you know, do you know\nWhere would I go?\n-I go, I go\n\n[Verse 3: DMX]\nI feel the ghost from within, comin' back to haunt me\nStay lovin' my peoples, even though they don't want me\nWhen I was bad, I was forgotten, like I was dead and rotten\nShould've been gettin' love, but instead was plottin'\nShit wasn't right, and it was all blamed on me\nDidn't know that I was special 'til this rap shit came to be\nGave me a way out, showed me it was better to teach\nThan bust niggas with the 4-4, leave 'em dead in the streets\nOver beef that was worth less, than the cost of the slugs that I bought to kill them\nAnd that's because I thought I ought to kill 'em\nLittle did I know, death wasn't right\nDidn't always show every breath was a life\nIt was to be captured in suspended animation\nTo be felt by all, understood by every nation\nWhat's the sense of hatin', when I can show love\nWhat's the sense of fakin', when I can show blood\n\n[Mary J. Blige]\nNow what's the moral to this story?\n[DMX]\nCome on!\n\n[Chorus: Mary J.

hoodie on\nListen, I'll come through your block\nMake all your niggas really missing\n(Where they at?)\nWhere they at now?\nYou want that real shit, don't 'cha?\nYou want that street shit, don't 'cha?\n\n[Verse 1: DMX]\nMan, cats nowadays be spittin' that fuck shit\nBird ass niggas spittin' that duck shit\nI'm from the old school and that there we don't fuck with\nBeen locked down on lockdown so you suck a dick\nFour ways to get in when you fit in: floor, chair\nBefore you climb the ladder try to find the stairs\nJust the go-getters, flow spitters\nThat roll with us are gorillas\nCold killers that blow triggers\nYou got niggas, but my niggas know your niggas\nAnd what my niggas know 'bout your niggas, they ho niggas\nOh no niggas, and I call 'em \"oh no niggas\" 'cause the last thing them bitches said was, \"oh no\" nigga\nYou're about to go, nigga\nAnd the last thing your people heard was\n\"Amen from the past and release the birds\"\nWe gonna' end it with the word, may God rest his soul\nAnd though it looks like he's sleeping, to the touch he's cold\n\n[Hook: Swizz Beatz]\nLa familia\nIf it ain't about the dog, we ain't feelin' ya'\nA lot of rappers been soft for a long

reckless and you make reckless plans\nSo, respect that we can dance\nBitch ass nigga\nMotherfuck you and your man, we can do it with the hands\nFuck I need a gun for?\nI done fucked a lot of bitches already\nSo when it come to pussy you just one more\nHit 'em with the 'what for'\nThat's when you know a nigga's a bitch and he's still gonna' get the hand, but you like, \"What for?\"\nReally? You want more?\nI come through with the click, click boom - click, click, boom\nPut it through your front door\nBrains on the wall like paint\n'cause I don't need to know what it is as long as I know what it ain't\nAin't a fuckin' thing fake about me\nThe devil spent so much time ruining my life\nWhat would the snake do without me?\nKeep running your fucking mouth and see what happens to niggas that keep running they fucking mouth\nThey get knocked the fuck out, nigga\n\n[Hook: Swizz Beatz]\nLa familia\nIf it ain't about the dog, we ain't feelin' ya'\nA lot of rappers been soft for a long time\nBout to put the hoodie dog all times\nThey said pain is back\nI said, naw, Bain is back\nThe Dark Knight blitzing with the hoodie on\nListen, I'll come through your block\nMake all your niggas really missing\nWhere they at now?\nYou want that real shit, don't cha'?\nYou want that street shit, don't cha'?\n\n[Outro: DMX (talking)]\nReal niggas recognize real niggas man\nA real nigga ain't gonna go through the trouble of trying a real nigga\nCuz he know a real nigga will get down just like he get down\nAnd he don't want that headache\nHe'd rather push up on a soft ass nigga\nHe spot a bitch nigga from a mile away\nAnd carry 'em just like, know what I mean?"}}, {"title": "We in Here", "album": "Year of the Dog...

much\nBloodline is where the pups at\nThey off the Grand Champ, yea what black\nDon't nothin move less, dog say so\nCats clueless about the way it go\nOff the chain I got at least 3 kills\nEven though my last album only did 3 mil\nI still give em chill cuz they feel dog\nI can't help what it is, shit is real dog\nYou must have thought that it was a joke or somethin'\nNow you done fucked around\nAnd got your man choked for frontin'\nNow hold up playa cuz I don't play those games\nAnd don't ask me shit cuz I don't say no names\nSee what I know I'm taking to the fuckin' grave\nSo keep knockin cuz you ain't gettin a fuckin' thing\n\n[Hook x4]\n\n[Verse 2]\nAy yo\nWho we be was off the last joint\nBut now it's who we see and we forget the last joint\nCats ain't never walked like X\nEven before Kool G Rap talked like sex\nI've been around since at least 83\nSo ain't no sense in you motherfuckers hatin' me\nCuz I'm gon be here when you cats is gone\nAnd other cats is on, another batch is born\nDon't give a fuck about none of y'all\nFuck each and every one of y'all\nCuz I done done it all, been where ya at\nBeen where ya goin', then brought it back\nI tried to tell ya about it but you wouldn't listen\nNow I'm gonna take you to the hood cuz the hood will listen\nI wish you woulda listened cuz then you woulda known\nThat it's only right to give a dog a bone\nBitch\n\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Verse 3]\nAw Man\nThere are some things I can't stand\nWhen a nigga holla wanna shake my left hand\nWhen a nigga follow cuz he actin like my man\nNigga might as well swallow cuz he actin like a fan\nAnd I got balls like you do\nMan I got Paul to pull through you\nStan don't they know how we do\nEar to the streets with our hearts to the people\nGots to give a little to get somethin back\nAnd what you usually give see you ain't nothin black\nBut when you don't give then it won't last\nHis shit will disappear like wit a nigga that smoked fast\nYou'll get broke fast, that's the Lord's will\nHold up I think somebody's a the door, Shhh chill\nYou sit right there, I'm gonna answer that\nCuz when I finish poppin ain't nobody answerin back\n\n[Hook x4]\n\n[Outro]\nFuck it"}},

be\nMake you wanna.. then I'm gonna..\nCause I gotta.. POP POP, POP POP (nigga!)\n\nI look through the 11th floor window\nTake one last puff of the indo\nLook through the scope, and let like ten go\nBreak it down, back in the briefcase\nWipe the sweat off my face so I can leave safe\nOutside I breathe safe\nNigga never saw it comin, that's how he got it\nNever even thought of runnin, cause a nigga plotted\nSmart niggas get niggas killed for real\nI know, they make a deal? I'm comin with the steel\nIt's gon' be that cat you don't see that's gon' pop you\nStop you in your motherfuckin tracks nigga and drop you\nGet rid of all the clothes (uh-huh) dump the gun\nI hate to be the type of nigga to leave you, slugged and run\nBut I'm on the job and right now there's more niggas that need to be, left with a head full of lead, restin easily\nAnd that twenty G's a fee, put to a good use\nThe only excuse I have for what I do is, love of abuse\n\nChorus 2X\n\n[DMX]\nI can catch you in the very building that you live in\nWait until you get right at your door then start spittin\nNow they got a ribbon tied to the rail at the top of the steps\nI was there, you ain't DIE at the top of the steps\nI can do that walk behind you shit and follow you home (shhh)\nMake a noise, you turn around and I put one in your dome (BOOM!\nLast thing you saw was chrome and a, flash of light\nI blast him right, nigga, that's yo' ass tonight\nI could put a bomb in your car and watch it explode (BOOM!)\nThen make em call, tell em all they found was a piece of your clothes and a small piece of your nose and, bone from your arm\nWhich they really couldn't tell apart, because of the bomb\nI could be waitin, camped out in yo' car, in the backseat\nWith some fuckin chickenwire, soon as you hit the backstreet\nI jump up like Jack-in-the-Box, strangle the shit out yo' ass\nClean up the mess and, get away from the cops\n\nChorus 2X\n\n[DMX]\nI could be the UPS delivery boy (uh-huh) or the man\nWorkin at Toys'R'Us handin yo' kid a brand new toy\nI could be the one servin your food wherever you go to eat at\nOr that nigga on the corner that you ask, \"Yo, where the weed at?\"\nI could be the one driving the school bus that yo' kids in\nExcept that, I don't like to involve, women and children\nA nigga got feelings, I just put em aside\nAnd when it's time for me to do my job, I just ride\nI don't get much sleep (uh) my soul's tormented\nI wish it was a lie but everything I said I meant it\nI know I'm doin wrong and everyday I beg the Lord\nTo forgive me for fuckin with the, double-edged sword\nShit ain't goin too well, BUT THAT'S MY LIFE\nI know I'm goin to hell, BUT THAT'S MY LIFE\nSometimes I think what will I do, WITH MY LIFE\nKill nigga kill this IS MY LIFE\n\nChorus 2.5X", "image":

P]\nHoliday Styles\nBitch, I get you shot in the head or shot in the neck\nIf I ain't gettin proper respect\nI don't care if you rap, I still spit in your grill\nI don't give a fuck, never have, never will\nIf it ain't on your hip, then you're lookin to die\nI ain't tryin to be the nigga that's gonna look at the sky\nAsk God why I'm broke, bitch, I'm cooking the pie\nWe all gon' die, sooner or later, matter of time\nMy niggas sell crack, with a package of dimes\nHundred or more, in front of the store, waitin to bubble\nBrand new nine, and an eight in a bubble\nI put sixteen above ya neck, I love my set\nNiggas think they a thug, then thug to death (uh-huh)\nCause the P gonna squeeze 'til no slugs is left (what)\nYou know I'm good with a hundred of 'dro, gun and an O\nYou think your shit butter? Hop in front of this toast\n\n[Sheek Louch]\nYo, aiyyo, aiyyo\nI say what I want, fuck what y'all think is cool\nAnd I hate cops, cause most y'all was dicks in school\nNo pussy gettin niggas tryin to cuff the God\nPlay Sheik out in the yard, but that shit too hard\nMy dough too long, nowadays, my flow too strong\nWhat y'all make in a year, I kick that for a song\nCheck my car, I don't care, I don't play fair\nKeep some shit in the stash box, then get me the chair\nAnd it don't buck shot and the blast is hard to hear\nI'm a true thug nigga, bring it straight to your crew\nSmall yell when I rap, I'm basically talkin to you\nYou see the pain in my eye? Nigga, the flame in my eye?\nI'm tryin to leave my kids some real fuckin change when I die\nFrom rappin or tellin some cat to reach for the sky\nI'm that hunt down nigga, with the four pound nigga\nBounty hunt your whole crew til my bullets go through, WHAT?\n\n[Jadakiss]\nYo, yo, yo, yo\nAll I need is a big gun and a Coupe that's crazy quick\nA nice house with five rooms, maybe six\nA town where money is coming, eighty bricks\nBreak 'em down to all twenties, is a crazy flip\nBet you never even felt the heat\nTil I put the M1 next to your waves and melt the grease\nStreets help niggas; niggas don't help the streets\nY'all use beats for help; we help the beats\nWho want it with me? Who want it with Sheek? Who want it with P?\nIf I say so myself, it's a wonderful three\nBe in the hood with all your jewels in the glovebox\nSame niggas that-a rob you love L.O.X. (uh)\nAll types of burners, even snub Glocks (uh)\nNice size tecs you could carry in your sweats (uh)\nFind your man dead in the trunk of a car (uh)\nIt's Jada {*mwwaa*} responsible for breakin your heart (uh)\nUh\n\n[Drag-On]\nCreep through the streets\nFor some of y'all rappers, that's mighty hard\nMe the Security? Protectin my body? I let my shotty guard\nPut chill pills in brains, bullets like Tylenol\nMake niggas drowsy from the blood loss, got em noddin off\nAnd take casket naps, fuck that\nYou shoulda never let this bastard rap\nAll I know is cold winter, hot slugs through your snorkel\nNo parents, tale from my horror's no morals\nRaised in the wrong era, with no guidance\nSo you dyin? It's no problem, no lyin\nDrag's fire; so ya hamburger beef? I french-fry 'em\nDrag done ate your food\nLike I know to raise your dukes so guard your chin up\nDrag barrels, but shit, I spit-bubble your skin up\nDrag scorch niggas for dinner but season 'em well\nI don't brag I let the streets tell\nPo'-po' now you see he fell\n\n[DMX] {*overlapping last line*}\nUh, uh, now you motherfuckers\nKnow what my name means when you hear it in the streets (uh)\nY'all bitches fear it cause you weak\nYou wanna hear it? I make it speak (WHAT?)\nYou ain't ever bust a gun, but there's a lot of greasy talkin (uh-huh)\nWhat the science behind that son? (I don't know)\nA lot of easy walkin\nI bust shit down (uh) got down (uh) kick down (uh) shot down (uh)\nAin't tryin to talk about what I got now, but I got now (WHAT?)\nI ain't never sold a brick, I done stuck niggas up (c'mon)\nAnd for talkin too much shit? I done fucked niggas up (uh)\nIt can get \"Dark\" for real, and I think you already know that (uh-huh)\nWell think about it with the brick in your hand before you throw that\nNow don't act, cause actin might get you rollin\nWith what you ain't ready to handle (UHH)\nAll that's left of your memory, is a candle (WOO!)\nIt happens quick fast nigga, to bitch ass niggas\nTalkin reckless behind your back, them kiss ass niggas (uh)\nFrom the rap shit to the street shit, I keep shit tight\nLet them cats spit that weak shit (What!)\nI'm DOG FOR LIFE!

talkin'\nWould they lay somebody's else's head where you lay\nDo they find it easy to be hard\nAnd find it even harder to be easy\nYou know sometimes I close my eyes and I wonder\nIf I ever left how much you'd miss me\nOh, somebody told me blood was thicker than water\nIf a man can say that he can recognize his own daughter\nAnd if hell is below would you pay the price to go\nThen I can make it to heaven for sure\n\n[Hook: Adreena Mills]\nThis is a cold world (what), cold world\nWe make it this way, but we don't like it this way\nThis is a cold world (what), cold world\nWe make it this way, but we don't like it this way\n\n[Verse 1: DMX]\nCats don't know what they say what they talkin'\nSo I just let a nigga say what he feel\nFuckin' with the kid they gon' end up in the coffin\n'Cause I'ma say what I gotta say with the steel\nNiggas hatin' 'cause I got a job\nI know it's they job to be hatin'\nI'm a dog so I don't fuck with cats\n'Cause they gon' have me livin' in a state pen\nIt's about time I reacted\nLook what y'all did to this rap shit\nKnowin' niggas is wrong, come on with the cat shit\nWack shit, get niggas torn down, slapped quick\nBlam, blam, blam, go down that quick\nActin' like the truth was gone\nAnd I'm sayin' gotta deal with the ruthless one\nIt's 2 piece, leave your faggot ass toothless son\nI go hard, dog don't do it, too late, it's done\nHold up, I'ma show you why dog is the illest, kill this\nYou might not catch it, but you'll feel this\nThe realest nigga to ever do it\nThe realest nigga to ever go through it and y'all gon' bring me back to it\nY'all gon' make me lose my mind\nMiddle name is grime, came from crime\nYou thought I'ma change with time, niggas don't know me\nLet your man hold somethin', you ain't got it, nigga show me\n\n[Hook: Adreena Mills]\nThis is a cold world, cold world\nWe make it this way, but we don't like it this way\nThis is a cold world, cold world\nWe make it this way, but we don't like it this way\n\n[Bridge: Adreena Mills]\nThe tunnel looks bright up from behind but you gotta keep movin', movin', movin'\nBecause if life stops spinnin' in the right direction whose losin', losin', losin', losin'\nSee in the night, I pray to keep me breathin'\nTo see another day to give them somethin' to believe in\n'Cause I know it won't always be this way\nWhen you tryin' hard to make a change",

you talkin'\nWould they lay somebody's else's head where you lay\nDo they find it easy to be hard\nAnd find it even harder to be easy\nYou know sometimes I close my eyes and I wonder\nIf I ever left how much you'd miss me\nOh, somebody told me blood was thicker than water\nIf a man can say that he can recognize his own daughter\nAnd if hell is below would you pay the price to go\nThen I can make it to heaven for sure\n\n[Hook: Adreena Mills]\nThis is a cold world (what), cold world\nWe make it this way, but we don't like it this way\nThis is a cold world (what), cold world\nWe make it this way, but we don't like it this way\n\n[Verse 1: DMX]\nCats don't know what they say what they talkin'\nSo I just let a nigga say what he feel\nFuckin' with the kid they gon' end up in the coffin\n'Cause I'ma say what I gotta say with the steel\nNiggas hatin' 'cause I got a job\nI know it's they job to be hatin'\nI'm a dog so I don't fuck with cats\n'Cause they gon' have me livin' in a state pen\nIt's about time I reacted\nLook what y'all did to this rap shit\nKnowin' niggas is wrong, come on with the cat shit\nWack shit, get niggas torn down, slapped quick\nBlam, blam, blam, go down that quick\nActin' like the truth was gone\nAnd I'm sayin' gotta deal with the ruthless one\nIt's 2 piece, leave your faggot ass toothless son\nI go hard, dog don't do it, too late, it's done\nHold up, I'ma show you why dog is the illest, kill this\nYou might not catch it, but you'll feel this\nThe realest nigga to ever do it\nThe realest nigga to ever go through it and y'all gon' bring me back to it\nY'all gon' make me lose my mind\nMiddle name is grime, came from crime\nYou thought I'ma change with time, niggas don't know me\nLet your man hold somethin', you ain't got it, nigga show me\n\n[Hook: Adreena Mills]\nThis is a cold world, cold world\nWe make it this way, but we don't like it this way\nThis is a cold world, cold world\nWe make it this way, but we don't like it this way\n\n[Bridge: Adreena Mills]\nThe tunnel looks bright up from behind but you gotta keep movin', movin', movin'\nBecause if life stops spinnin' in the right direction whose losin', losin', losin', losin'\nSee in the night, I pray to keep me breathin'\nTo see another day to give them somethin' to believe in\n'Cause I know it won't always be this way\nWhen you tryin' hard to make a change"}}, {"title": "Untouchable", "album": "Grand Champ", "year": "2003-09-16", "lyrics": "[DMX]\nUhh (huh) yeah, it is what it is\nYah'mean?

let's get that money!\n\n[DMX]\nIt's two o'clock and I'm just about to hit the street\nTil I knock off this rock I don't get to eat\nSometimes that's like that's the only reason why I hustle\nStep on toes, strongarm and show a lil' muscle\nAin't no real dough, that's why a nigga feel so frustrated\nI hate it, seein crab niggas that made it\nAnd I'm robbin cats just as broke as myself\nLivin foul and ain't lookin out for my health, where's the wealth?\nNot in New York, cause niggas talk about goin out of state\nMoney got an eighth, comin back, hot with a lot of weight\nWhere's my plate nigga? I'm hungry too\nSo I'mma do like hungry do, and get a hungry crew\nNiggas that ain't never had, and doin bad\nWill be glad to get up off that stoop lookin' sad\nGrab your bags, it's about to go down\nWe goin to this hicktown, let's get the lowdown, on how they get down\n\nChorus 2X\n\n[DMX]\nI gots to make a move and make it soon\nGots to take a block and make it boom\nWe comin through so make some room\nFound somethin that could be somethin if I pump it up\nThis kid Black is the only thing that could fuck it up\nThe purple top thirty-five smalls is ringin' bells\nBut I'mma crush him with the black 40 double-L's\nI send two niggas back up top, and come back\nWe chop up rock, by midnight, we open up shop\nIt's four in the mornin, we on the block creepin\nKillin the cash, while yo' ass is sleepin\nLook here, I'm what they call a true hustler\nCause, nigga, if I ain't know you since I was like six\nThen I don't trust ya\nAnd we'll bust ya over somethin petty like a few dollars\nPut somethin hot up in that ass and watch you holla (\"Ahhhhh!\")\nYou think I'm here for the ho flow? I want the dough flow\nAnd fuck the po'-po', nigga keep a fo'-fo'\n\nChorus 2X\n\n[DMX]\nI spend my money on niggas cause niggas get me rich\nAnd a bitch ain't doin shit but suckin my dick\nNiggas is family now, and we stand strong\nThirty niggas on six blocks, makin the cash long\nShit is good, because niggas gettin what they been wantin\nAnd we see the same shit, other New York niggas frontin\nStick up kids huntin, but I ain't got no love for em\nI keep the burner and the duster with the glove for em\nThem motherfuckin knockers come at us and chop us\nAnd I know they, really tryin to stop us and wanna drop us\nSo we pump, from the alley and the last house we use as a cash house\nIt's holdin em strong, it's a stash house\nI got runners that work for twelve hour shifts\nAnd when them niggas keep they count correct, I don't riff\nBut I ain't tryin to hear that nigga took your pack shit\nAin't tryin to hear jack shit, fuck the black bitch\nI ain't a greedy nigga, all I want is a five year run\nIf I don't make it, then fuck it, let me die near a gun\nGot bitches to transport without an escort\nI'm makin moves from D.C. up to Westport\nLocal police ain't a problem cause they don't even stress us\nIt be them ATF niggas that have you under pressure\nJust so you know, ain't gon' never put my Glock down (why nigga?)\nCause I'm a hustlin motherfucker, and I'm holdin my block down\n\nChorus 2X"}}, {"title": "World's Greatest", "album": "Ruff Ryders: Past, Present, Future", "year": null, "lyrics": "[Hook: Swizz Beatz]\nIt's the world's greatest (Ruff Ryders)\nMake you throw

Boyyyyyyy!\n(\"There's nothin you can do...\" *repeats in background*)\n\n[Chorus](2x)\nX is comin' for ya, can't do nothin for ya\nCause X is comin' for ya\nRun, hide, duck, duck\nWe don't give a fuck, fuck\n\n[Verse 1: DMX]\nLook in the mirror (uh) say my name five times\nTurn out the lights (WHAT?) then I done crooked nine lives\nDon't get scared now nigga, finish it cause you started it\nWatch shit grow out of control, now you want no part of it (c'mon)\nNigga, where yo' heart at? Tell me what you made of\nAlready lost a stripe cause I know what you afraid of\nWe both know you pussy, but I ain't gonna say nuttin\nJust hit a nigga off, and you can stay frontin (uhh)\nI gotcha back for now, till I cased the joint (what?)\nPlus, give the Feds a real good place to point (what?)\nAnd laced the joint, I ain't gonna front I had my hands full\nGlad to be alive, but you like, that's that bull (grrrrr)\nBut now you know, what you get, when you fuckin wit\nCause you shoulda left alone, now you stuck in shit\nDuckin shit, til that headpiece gets BLAZED\nScreamin this, ahh, cease to the grave\nIts over, at least for you it is\nDon't need the coroner, to see how true it is\nI knew these kid, but did that stop me from gettin em, screamin\nIT WAS ALL FOR THE MONEY, while I'm hittin and splittin him down\nFrom his nose to his nuts (what?)\nFire department comin, put the hose to his guts (what?)\nWashed away, just like dirt when it rains (uh)\nAnd now because of you, I hurt when it rains (grrrrr)\n\n[Chorus](2x)\nX is comin' for ya, can't do nothin for ya\nCause X is comin' for ya\nRun, hide, duck, duck\nWe don't give a fuck, fuck\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy real name is Damien and my girl's name is Carrie\nThat Poltergeist bitch is hot, but too young to marry\nThat nigga Satan be fakin mad jacks so I taxed his ass\nEvery chance I get, is just another hit (uh, uh, uh, what?)\nAnother nigga split; there go white meat - another nigga\nTakin up room in the morgue under a white sheet (c'mon)\nThat's what you get for tryin to take it there (uhh)\nBut with this Desert Eagle in your mouth\nYou cryin bout let's make it fair (uhh)\nSometimes it takes pain to make the brain a little smarter (uh-huh)\nWhen I think the rain will stop, it only starts to rain harder (uh-huh)\nPart of the game is niggas wanna become fam-ous\nAnd doin the same shit I do, remain nameless (uh, uh, uh, uh)\nI want house money, Jag money (what?) so I gots ta bag money\nI ain't laughin, but yo it's mad funny (c'mon)\nI used to talk about that shit you got\nBut you ain't never got that shit when that shit get hot!\nRunnin up in the spot with, two niggas from Israel\nCause it is-real, you did squeal, now how you think yo' kids feel?\nKnowin you died a snitch, I look in yo' eyes and see a bitch\nWasn't surprised to see a switch (c'mon)\nLet's make it quick, I got a flight at 6 goin to Pakistan\nSo let this nigga know, I know he pussy, I'mma smack his man (uhh)\nFuckin Willie niggas and silly niggas\nI'd rather be eatin of a plate\nWith all them Baltimore and Philly niggas (WHAT?)\nCause I done took about as much I can stand\nA nigga smilin in my face like they my motherfuckin man\nAiyyo, it gets a lot worse, cause there's a curse (WHAT?)\nThat says, the reward for bein real, is a hearse\nBefore you turn thirty, cause the dirty shit you did (uhh)\nCatches up and get you right when you thought you slid\nIt's gettin dark, and with the cold to the heart\nYou realize, you ain't gonna see your shorty\nOld enough to walk, for real\n\n[Chorus](2x)\nX is comin' for ya, can't do nothin for ya\nCause X is comin' for ya\nRun, hide, duck, duck\nWe don't give a fuck, fuck",

"[DMX]\nYou got a minute for Yo' son, Father? I need to talk\nI'm so tired of tryin' to run, Father, let's take a walk\nI'm so sorry for what I done, Father, it ain't my fault\nBut the devil's been on my back lately, he's like a hawk\nYou never give us more than we can handle, but it's gettin' hard\nAnd I'm a strong individual, but I need You, God\nLot of things that I used to, I don't wanna\nRun the streets like I used to, I know I'm gonna\nSpeak the word for You one day\nUp in there like, \"Hallelujah!\" on Sunday\nI thank You Lord for the blessings that You gave me\nAnd for my life, with the blessings You have saved me\nAnd for my wife, You have carried me enough times - and that's the truth\nMarried me to rough times, throughout my Youth\nAnd through it all I saw that You was still with me\nI was that one lost sheep and You was comin' to get me\n\n[Hook]\nLord You got me like... Your love got me like...\nLord You got me like... Your love got me like...\nLord You got me like... Your love got me like...\nLord You got me like... Your love got me like...\n\n[DMX]\nI look at life a little different now, since You hugged me\nAnd I always loved my peoples, but now they love me\nThank You for the love, Lord, we praise Ya\nJacob's descendants, from Africa to Asia\nPleadin' the blood of Christ over our life\nWrong or right, just help us make it through the night\nAnd we'll shout Yo' name in times of need\nAnd times of joy, and, when we bleed\nAnd, when we are overcome with greed\nYou ain't gon' have to tell me twice, I'mma take heed\nAnd because of what You've given me, I know You'll deliver me\nAnd I won't drown no matter how deep the river be\nYou are the strength I, never knew I had\nKept the heart good when they told me it was bad\nAll praises due to Ya\nThat's why I had to dedicate somethin' new to Ya, thank You Father\n\n[Hook]\nLord, You got me like... Your love got me like...\nLord, You got me like... Your love got me like...\nLord, You got me like... Your love got me like...\nLord, You got me like... Your love got me like...\n\n[DMX]\nUhh... I never knew a love like, this before\nMessin with the thug life I, missed it all\nYou opened the doors and, let me in\nI'm down for the cause so, let's begin\nPrayers that You give to me I give to them\nSame way You live in me I live in them\nLife is a blessing now\nYou got me smilin' from inside of my heart, when inside it was dark\nAnd it doesn't rain anymore\nOnly sunshine, no pain anymore, I really love my\nYou washed away the tears with the fears\nI'm happier than I've ever been in my life, the whole thirty years\nYou know that... one day I'll speak the word\nYou know that... when I do I will be heard\nYou know that... You gave me a permanent smile\nAnd You know this, Father, because I'm Yo' child, what?\n\n[Hook]\nLord, You got me like... Your love got me like...\nLord, You got me like... Your love got me like...\nLord, You got me like... Your love got me like...\nLord, You got me like... Your love got me like...\n\n[Outro]\nLord, You got me like... Your love got me like...\nLord, You got me like... Your love got me like...\nLord, You got me like... Your love got me like...\nLord, You got me like...

walk it\nY'all niggas could get it\nBut it must all go down\nX is wit' it because\nWE GON' WALK THESE DOGS\nYou got it living BACK livin' with salt\nI'ma' bring it BACK cause I'mma go hard\nFuckin' til' a nigga play the yard\nWE GON' WALK THESE DOGS\nGettin' down has never been an issue\nI'ma bust my gun and not gon' miss you\nHate the smell of the slug burnin' the tissue\nWE GON' WALK THESE DOGS\n\n[Hook 2X][DMX]\nNigga bust up all the thugs\nIt's about to get real out of hand dog\nBetter get your man dog\nHit 'em and leave him where niggas can't stand dog\nIt's you man dog!\n\n[Kashmir]\nYou better come in and get him now\nBetter grab his arm and sit him down\nNigga leave him in his house, I'm a put him down\n\n[DMX]\nWE GON' WALK THESE DOGS!\n\n[Kashmir]\nWe don't give a fuck about you\nYou talk real slick Homie, But we doubt you\nGot slugs that a put a nigga right back out you Cause\n\n[DMX]\nWE GON' WALK THESE DOGS!\n\n[Kashmir]\nI'm right here now nigga what up\nAlways talkin' about how you could of, would of\nBut never doin' shit, cause you sweeter then sugar\n\n[DMX]\nWE GON' WALK THESE DOGS!\n\n[Kashmir]\nGo on now, I'm not the one\nKashmir 7:30 about to pop the gun\nHave your mom's on the news sreamin' \"Not My Son\"\n\n[DMX]\nWE GON' WALK THESE DOGS!\n\n(Chorus)\n\n[DMX]\nDon't fuck wit' things you don't know about\nI'll have a Smith & Wesson TO show him out\nTake him to the desert and blow him out Cause!\nWE GON' WALK THESE DOGS!\nRight to the streets, with the heat\nUntil I find something to eat, so don't sleep\nFuck around, thinkin' it's sweet, til' a nigga creep cause\nWE GON' WALK THESE DOGS!\nDon't cry now, it's too late\nI'ma empty ya' stomach of that shit you ate\nOne time in the park, make a nigga lose weight, because\nWE GON' WALK THESE DOGS!\nBigga, Betta, stronga, fasta\nFuck a bitch longa if I have at to\nAnd then I will cap her directly after\n\n(Chorus 2X)"}}, {"title": "Heat", "album": "Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My

what's my next move\nDo I stick with the score, or get with the door\nFeds got the drop in the back of the Uhaul\nSnipers on the roof, chance of gettin' away - too small\nTell 'em like this, \"Look, it's gonna be a shoot out\nWhoever make it out meet back at the new house\nGood luck, if I don't see you again peace\nLet's handle our business with these government police\"\nYou and you go out the front, you take the back\nYou cover the first two and I'll take the sack\nBoomer didn't make it, neither did Stan\nNow it's three niggas, splittin' four hundred grand (aight)\nWe all feel the loss but enjoy the profit\nThe game is the same, ain't nothin' gonna stop it\nMost times you make it, one time you won't\nAll niggas could really do is have a vest under the coat (come on)\n\n[Chorus: DMX &

it? Aight, let's get busy\nRun up in the bank, bitch, *woman screams* hit the deck\nYo, bust money and get the keys off his neck (come here)\nWe on the clock, three minutes until we finished\nFeds are on the way, but I'm tryna see spinach\nIn and out, duffel bag across the back\nExtra large sports coat to cover up the Mac\nFeds they attack, I spit lead out, niggas spread out\nRun up on a civilian in his car, make him get out\n\n[Chorus: DMX & Swizz Beats]\nThe heat is on\nAre y'all really ready to fly\nThe heat is on\nAre y'all really ready to die\nThe heat is on\nHave your mother ready to cry\nThe heat is on\nHuh\nThe heat is on\nYou know\n\n[Chorus: DMX & Swizz Beats]\nThe heat is on\nAre y'all really ready to fly\nThe heat is on\nAre y'all really ready to die\nThe heat is on\nHave your mother ready to cry\nThe heat is on\nHuh\nThe heat is on\nYou know\n\n[Verse 3: DMX]\nHigh speed chasin', racin' through the streets\nDeath's in the air, I can taste it through the heat\nMy partner's goin' fast, I don't think he's gonna last\nBut if he don't, I'mma hit his wife with his half\nBut that's the type of nigga I am, this ain't just rappin'\nI made it, he didn't, but hey, shit happens\nWhat can I do, but go on livin'\nFleein' from the condo, I'll go on a ribbon\nLife goes on, that might sound wrong, but hey\nWe all live by the rules of the game we play\nDay to day, death is a possibility\nThe way I play is a vest stops you from killin' me\nIt's too hot to be in the heat 'casue it's on\nToo hot to be in the streets, so I'm gone\nGo back to bein' discreet, live long\n'Til one day either me or the heat is gone\nCome On!\n\n[Chorus: DMX & Swizz Beats]\nThe heat is on\nAre y'all really ready to fly\nThe heat is on\nAre y'all really ready to die\nThe heat is on\nHave your mother ready to cry\nThe heat is on\nHuh\nThe heat is on\nYou know\n\n[Chorus: DMX & Swizz Beats]\nThe heat is on\nAre y'all really ready to fly\nThe heat is on\nAre y'all really ready to die\nThe heat is on\nHave your mother ready to cry\nThe heat is on\nHuh\nThe heat is on\nYou know\nThe heat is on", "image": "https://images.genius.com/236ac8cb125196c489579b947c3b2fb8.945x945x1.jpg", "artist": "DMX", "raw": {"annotation_count": 7, "api_path": "/songs/17478", "apple_music_id": "815326415", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/17478/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "DMX recalls the movie \u201cHEAT\u201d starring Robert Deniro.

too small\nTell 'em like this, \"Look, it's gonna be a shoot out\nWhoever make it out meet back at the new house\nGood luck, if I don't see you again peace\nLet's handle our business with these government police\"\nYou and you go out the front, you take the back\nYou cover the first two and I'll take the sack\nBoomer didn't make it, neither did Stan\nNow it's three niggas, splittin' four hundred grand (aight)\nWe all feel the loss but enjoy the profit\nThe game is the same, ain't nothin' gonna stop it\nMost times you make it, one time you won't\nAll niggas could really do is have a vest under the coat (come on)\n\n[Chorus: DMX & Swizz Beats]\nThe heat is on\nAre y'all really ready to fly\nThe heat is on\nAre y'all really ready to die\nThe heat is on\nHave your mother ready to cry\nThe heat is on\nHuh\nThe heat is on\nYou know\n\n[Chorus: DMX & Swizz Beats]\nThe heat is on\nAre y'all really ready to fly\nThe heat is on\nAre y'all really ready to die\nThe heat is on\nHave your mother ready to cry\nThe heat is on\nHuh\nThe heat is on\nYou know\n\n[Verse 2: DMX]\nMe and my two mans gave money, twenty grand\nFor a scam, they don't get the condo in the sand\nAnd chance of gettin' caught slim next to none\nBut now we like three deep, need that extra gun\nBump into my man, I remember from up north\nI remember he had principles and wasn't nothin' soft\nOff to discuss, just what's goin' dizzy\nEverybody got it? Aight, let's get busy\nRun up in the bank, bitch, *woman screams* hit the deck\nYo, bust money and get the keys off his neck (come here)\nWe on the clock, three minutes until we finished\nFeds are on the way, but I'm tryna see spinach\nIn and out, duffel bag across the back\nExtra large sports coat to cover up the Mac\nFeds they attack, I spit lead out, niggas spread out\nRun up on a civilian in his car, make him get out\n\n[Chorus: DMX & Swizz Beats]\nThe heat is on\nAre y'all really ready to fly\nThe heat is on\nAre y'all really ready to die\nThe heat is on\nHave your mother ready to cry\nThe heat is on\nHuh\nThe heat is on\nYou know\n\n[Chorus: DMX & Swizz Beats]\nThe heat is on\nAre y'all really ready to fly\nThe heat is on\nAre y'all really ready to die\nThe heat is on\nHave your mother ready to cry\nThe heat is on\nHuh\nThe heat is on\nYou know\n\n[Verse 3: DMX]\nHigh speed chasin', racin' through the streets\nDeath's in the air, I can taste it through the heat\nMy partner's goin' fast, I don't think he's gonna last\nBut if he don't, I'mma hit his wife with his half\nBut that's the type of nigga I am, this ain't just rappin'\nI made it, he didn't, but hey, shit happens\nWhat can I do, but go on livin'\nFleein' from the condo, I'll go on a ribbon\nLife goes on, that might sound wrong, but hey\nWe all live by the rules of the game we play\nDay to day, death is a possibility\nThe way I play is a vest stops you from killin' me\nIt's too hot to be in the heat 'casue it's on\nToo hot to be in the streets, so I'm gone\nGo back to bein' discreet, live long\n'Til one day either me or the heat is gone\nCome On!\n\n[Chorus: DMX & Swizz Beats]\nThe heat is on\nAre y'all really ready to fly\nThe heat is on\nAre y'all really ready to die\nThe heat is on\nHave your mother ready to cry\nThe heat is on\nHuh\nThe heat is on\nYou know\n\n[Chorus: DMX & Swizz Beats]\nThe heat is on\nAre y'all really ready to fly\nThe heat is on\nAre y'all really ready to die\nThe

niggas is wit it\nNow what y'all want me to do\nKeep your shit the hardest\nIt's about to go down\nNiggas is ready to start this\nWar that's for sure\nNigga come and get it\nWe ride or die, why?\n'Cause our niggas is wit it\n\n[Verse 1]\nI want Monopoly money but I ain't even halfway there\n'Cause doin' dirt, a nigga got to take the back way there\nWhat it is, is the biz and it's dirty\nYou'll get rich but life expectancy is about thirty\nPlace of business is the hallways, I've been up for four days\nOn parole with warrants that'll send me back to Rahway\nIf I get caught across Jersey state lines\nFigure this 9-8 and I been runnin' since 8-9\nSo that's like 9 years delinquent time, you speak in crime then you know\n9 years you owe, get knocked, 9 years you gonna go\nNo probation or parole more time doin' nothin'\nDay room to the yard, writin' rhymes and frontin\nCarry niggas greasy because I'm built like that\nBury niggas easy 'cause they get killed like that\nIf you ain't in it wit me then you in my way, but either or\nYou will respect mine and leave TEC-9 and leave it for dude\nThe realest you gonna feel is when you face your death\n\"Sorry, I didn't know\" nigga, don't even waste your breath\nCoppin' pleas not D why you flippin'\nNigga know the only thing I'm really scared of is slippin'\nLettin' a nigga catch you when I got my guard down, so I keep 'em up\nNoddin' off with one eye open, I can freak it\nBut there's gonna be a time when I close 'em both\nLead poisonin', I'm a get hit with an overdose\nOver those drug things, crud things\nThink I don't know my slug stains, or blood blaze\nRaw gun playin' drama, sadness to another niggas momma\nI'mma be the the one that puts you up inside trauma\nThese are troublesome times and the crimes prevail\nAnd the dark side keep a nigga's ass in jail\nBada-boom, bada-bing, some of this and some of that\nI gots to boogie for a minute but you know I'm comin' back\n\n[Chorus]\nNow what

him right\nHit him in his face and hear them close the casket tight\n'Cause it's like it ain't nothin' but endin' it to a nigga\nStreet sweeper like ahhhh, sendin it to a nigga\nWhen you in the house you'll play by house rules\nTwo words you'll never hear again are house lose\nAnd that's house choose it ain't gonna be that, 'cause I can't see that\nReady to get up in this nigga's ass real good so where the weed at\nBelieve that, you ain't gon' see nothin' gettin' too familiar\nAnd I would tell you what I do but then I'd have to kill you\nAnd it ain't even worth it, I ain't gon' build

"[Intro]\nLet us pray for those that we've lost\nWe know that we miss them for selfish reasons\nOh Lord my God, indeed you I put my trust\nSave me, from all them that persecute me\nAnd deliver me, in Jesus name, GRRRRR\n\n[Hook]\nCause we all go anyway, I'mma say goodbye today\nCause it could be any day, I'mma say goodbye today\nWe've grown in so many ways, but I'mma say goodbye today\nCause it could be any day, I'mma say goodbye today-ayayyyy\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'mma say goodbye today, cause I don't know when\nWe gon' cross paths again, until then\nI'mma be that, and see that, speaks the truth\nBelieve that, I'mma see that, to reach the youth\nMy suffering will not be in vain (NOT)\nNeither will yo' pain ever since you passed to hear yo' name\nRest in peace to Autumn - we all know cancer cells kill\nBut if they caught 'em, they could've fought 'em\nIf you'd still be here, right here with us\nWe'd have plenty time before death came to get us\nBUT, what is death like?  Should I really care?\nAfter looking at it, was life really fair?\nDid you burn any bridges?  Did you make amends?\nDid you ask God for forgiveness for your sins?\nWhat is Heaven like?  If you could come back, should you?\nIf you could communicate for a moment there, would you?\n... Just questions that we ask ourselves, every day (wanna know)\n\n[Hook]\nCause we all go anyway, I'mma say goodbye today\nCause it could be any day, I'mma say goodbye today\nWe've grown in so many ways, but I'mma say goodbye today\nCause it could be any day, I'mma say goodbye today-ayayyyy\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo young, so gifted\nDirection of life was uplifted, when the wind shifted\nAnd took a turn for the worse, with the blessing come the curse\nA nigga stressing took the dog into the hearse\nMy nigga Divine was way too young to die\nFell out the nest and was way too young to fly\nBut that didn't stop fate from happening\nIdle time make the Devil\u2014HATE WHAT'S HAPPENING!\nGod no!  Why did it go that way?\nComing from his fans away, why did he go that day?\nLightly, I dare say, life goes on\nDonuts, Trey and Jerz I say, please be strong\nHe was supposed to be on the road with me\nI wish somebody WOULD'VE came to get me\nAnd niggas would've had to hit ME\nBut until then, MY FRIEND\nI'mma say goodbye today, cause you never know when\n\n[Hook]\nCause we all go anyway, I'mma say goodbye today\nCause it could be any day, I'mma say goodbye today\nWe've grown in so many ways, but I'mma say goodbye today\nCause it could be any day, I'mma say goodbye today-ayayyyy\n\n[Outro]\nGoodbye today, I'mma say goodbye today\nGoin away hey (uhh) goodbye today, I'mma say goodbye today\n(It's okay) And I say (let us pray)\nGoodbye today (and I say) say goodbye today\nGo on your way (and I say when you're, gone) I'mma say goodbye today\nI'mma say goodbye today (gotta say before you move on) HEY!\nYes (yeah!)\nI mean, this is life (yeah, say goodbye)\nWe are born, to die, so LET ME FLY! (know what I mean)\nLet me fly, we are born, to die (be good)\n{\"Sometimes the pain is too much to bear\" - repeat to end of Outro}\nCause I'm in a better place ('til we meet again)\nI'm in a better place (I don't know what form)\nSee you soon baby! (we'll meet again)\nHa ha! .. (But we will meet again)\n...\nSpread your wings (they gon' shed a tear on this one!)\nFly, I'll try not to cry, it'll be hard\nI just, miss, not having you here\nEven though I know you're in a better

ready to die\nSometimes a nigga that's your man might get it\nSometimes even though it's sweet, if you ain't with it\nSometimes the pain is too much to bear\nSometimes it rains too much to
