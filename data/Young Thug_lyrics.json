Produced by Young Shad and Ricky Racks, Thug comes hard with his crooning and braggadocios style to brag about his bestie.\n\n\u201cBest Friend\u201d officially went platinum in 2016.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/youngthug/status/749404633945219072\n\nThis song was met with controversy upon release when Louisiana rapper Tokyo Vanity threatened to sue Thugger. According to Complex Magazine, Vanity is threatening to sue Thugger for copyright infringement, claiming he stole her song \u201cThat\u2019s My Best Friend.\u201d\n\nThe Fader interviewed the director of the music video, Be El Be, who shared his opinion on who Thuggers \u201cbest friend\u201d really is:\n\nIf [Young Thug is] his own butler, if he\u2019s catching himself with himself, making love to himself, if he\u2019s in the bathroom getting changed and it\u2019s just him and him\u2014it\u2019s showing his best friend is himself. That self-esteem! He\u2019s a very stylish young man, so I would say that the inside meaning of that is that he is his own best friend.\n\nOn September 14th, 2015 the official music video was released by Young Thug. It is co-directed by Be El Be and the visuals show Thugger running into himself in everything he does. Pitchfork said it best (in regards to describing the video):\n\nYoung Thug\u2019s video for \u201cBest Friend\u201d begins with Young Thug walking in on Young Thug, who\u2019s in the process of hooking up with Young Thug. Then, Thug jumps in a car driven by Thug. Eventually, Thug\u2019s head is served at a dinner attended by Thug. \n\nFun Fact: 5 months later from the release of the music video, Young Thug read out the lyrics on GQ  so people can understand him better and simply for laughs and giggles!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/IVRXJ1Gd33g"}, "embed_content": "<div id='rg_embed_link_2165110' class='rg_embed_link' data-song-id='2165110'>Read <a

pass them a molly, now they kiss each-other (Hot!)\nEvery time I fuck I gotta hit me least like two bitches\nBoy, that dope been whipped, you need like new wrists\nForeign car outside, that bitch got two digits\nMoney stand like eight feet just like two midgets\n\n[Verse 1]\nWho the fuck told you that Young Thugger Thugger don't fuck up the beat?\nI got six cars and I also got rentals and all of 'em tinted\nNo, I'm not Nipsey, not from L.A., but I got keys to the city\nI fuck it, I suck it, I beat it down, then she beat me to the ceilin'\nStoner my lifestyle, I'm livin' too wild\nI came to make you proud, that money keep her around\nIn love with her head, I can't turn it down\nCan't wait for my time to come back around\nShe see that you don't got Lil Haiti's style\nPlus I just seen Snoop on Girls Gone Wild\nI just bought a Bentley and a bitch came with it\nYoung rich nigga hittin' million dollar licks\nBalling in New York like a motherfucking Knick\nYou better have them racks, you ever want to hear me spit\nAnd everywhere I go I gotta pass like the staff\nI'm goin' off top like a motherfuckin' lay up\n357, six shots like Al\nI left ten bands in a motherfuckin'

bags, but you\nI don't like using profanity, but the Young Thugger will gut you\nAll of my cups are muddy I fuck my bitches' buddies\nI just want nut like Buddy, all of my bitches buddies\nPanamera with the tinted roof\nAll the niggas dogs goin', \"Roof\"\nTop notch shawty, nigga ring came with karats\nYoung nigga rich, jewelry colder than the attic\nIf she ain't a virgin, then that bitch is only average\nI can't even hear ya, baby, get rid of the static\nI can't learn a bitch, but I learned mathematics\nI just ball her down whenever she call my pattern\n\n[Hook]\nOkay, cool, okay, bool,

let's do it\nYeeeee!\n\n[Pre-Hook: Young Thug]\nI wake up and go get me some new money\nYou know I'm living like a G\nThese lil niggas ain't gonna take nothin' from me\nYou know we do it like a G\nI swear to God I fuck on anyone\nJust like a gangsta, just like a G\nThis Duct Tape and YSL\nYou know I do it like a G\nG's up hoes down\nG's up hoes down\nG's up hoes down\nG's up hoes down\nG's up hoes down\nG's up hoes down\nG's up hoes down\nG's up hoes down\n\n[Hook: Trouble & Young Thug]\nLike a thief in the night\nI take anything but some pussy\nShe got that head like a dyke\nShe got that head that I like\nDeep in your partner ain't right\nPut that lil babe on ice\nI make the paper like rice\nHead on that bucket, your mothafuckin' life, Skoob\nI promise you don't know me\nI pull up bout my cake\nWhere I'm from is not safe\nI got fish, I'm a lake\nScoop them grits on a plate\nYet she thought it was steak\nI'm a thief in the night\nMake her ride like a bike\n\n[Verse 1: Young Thug & Trouble]\nI go down on a dyke, I go up on my price\nI might drop Kimbo Slice, kidnap like Uncle Ice\nI got grits at the beach and they white like a rice\nLet Trouble take your life\nAfter I give you five\nStraight put that five to the side\nIt ain't no question how nigga gon' ride\nWhen they come with them questions\nMy nigga get quiet, sh sh, nigga sit quiet, sh sh\nI am not taking no disrespect\nYou Patrick Ewing, you pump fakin'\nNo that won't happen on me\nI drop a key like the mufuckin' beat\nI look good as your dad on a Friday\nSo many cars I gotta buy a driveway\nNever gon' let 'em live a nigga crime day\nServing these X and P's instead of poppin'\nPockets fat up like they jumped 'em\nYSL, that slimy anaconda\nBicking back, being bool like a uncle\nI'm so geeked up I might fuck a condom\n\n[Hook: Trouble & Young Thug]\nLike a thief in the night\nI take anything but some pussy\nShe got that head like a dyke\nShe got that head that I like\nDeep in your partner ain't right\nPut that lil babe on ice\nI make the paper like Rice\nHead on that bucket, your mothafuckin' life, Skoob\nI promise you don't know me\nI pull up bout my cake\nWhere I'm from is not safe\nI got fish, I'm a lake\nScoop them grits on a plate\nYet she thought it was steak\nI'm a thief in the night\nMake her ride like a bike\n\n[Verse 2: Trouble & Young Thug]\nI get 'em all on the rice\nShe didn't even know what it was but she taste it\nI dig in, her shit sound like Jason\nI be on Percocets more than occasion\nThey betting on me like in Vegas\nBetting on me like I'm Vegas\nStick to the code man, there won't be no trace\nThugga Thugga, tell me what would you say?\nWhat would you say?\nNo J Money, but my gun say, \"Bow\"\nPop a molly, look at her then fiend\nI'm the target mofucka, no beam\nNo this shit is not good as it seems\nI might give her the boot with no jeans\nI kick shit like a chong and a ching\nI\u2019m a boss, I'm bout that unity\nSandwiches, you know you in between\nAnd you gotta know we at the green\nYou gotta be young nigga, wilder than Billie Jean\nGotta have paper for lawyer fees\nYou ain't with it, you a L\nStill getting it, yeah, bails\nBreak it down on the scale\nIf it add up, hell yeah, I do it\nLap back as he ran to it\n\n[Hook: Trouble & Young Thug]\nLike a thief in the night\nI take anything but some pussy\nShe got that head like a dyke\nShe got that head that I like\nDeep in your partner ain't right\nPut that lil babe on ice\nI make the paper like Rice\nHead on that bucket, your mothafuckin' life, Skoob\nI promise you don't know me\nI pull up bout my cake\nWhere I'm from is not safe\nI got fish, I'm a lake\nScoop them grits on a plate\nYet she thought it was steak\nI'm a thief in the night\nMake her ride like a bike"}},

items.\n\nTogether the three list off the many designer brands they\u2019d be willing to buy their respective women, such as Chanel, Christian Louboutin, Fendi, Herm\u00e8s, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, Yves Saint Laurent, and Dior.\n\nGunna, Baby, and Thugger would also be willing to purchase their women different luxury vehicles including: Bentley Sedans, Mercedes Benz, Lamborghini\u2019s, Porche Cayenne\u2019s, Mercedes G-Wagon\u2019s, and Range Rovers.\n\nWhen Slime Language\u2019s features were initially announced, Lil Baby wasn\u2019t listed as one of the guests on the project. However, soon after, feature list was updated to include his name. This is because he was only added to \u201cChanel (Go Get It)\u201d shortly before the song\u2019s release, replacing a verse by Lil Uzi Vert, as revealed in the demo version that leaked in early November 2018. This also explains why Baby\u2019s verse was updated a few days after the song\u2019s initial release."}, "embed_content": "<div id='rg_embed_link_3902284' class='rg_embed_link'

allowing them to purchase luxury items.\n\nTogether the three list off the many designer brands they\u2019d be willing to buy their respective women, such as Chanel, Christian Louboutin, Fendi, Herm\u00e8s, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, Yves Saint Laurent, and Dior.\n\nGunna, Baby, and Thugger would also be willing to purchase their women different luxury vehicles including: Bentley Sedans, Mercedes Benz, Lamborghini\u2019s, Porche Cayenne\u2019s, Mercedes G-Wagon\u2019s, and Range Rovers.\n\nWhen Slime Language\u2019s features were initially announced, Lil Baby wasn\u2019t listed as one of the guests on the project. However, soon after, feature list was updated to include his name. This is because he was only added to \u201cChanel (Go Get It)\u201d shortly before the song\u2019s release, replacing a verse by Lil Uzi Vert, as revealed in the demo version that leaked in early November 2018. This also explains why Baby\u2019s verse was updated a few days after the song\u2019s initial release."}, "comment_count": 0, "community": true, "custom_preview": null, "has_voters": true, "id":

my time\nGunna dripping with Uzi and Slime\nConnect with my bitch like a WiFi\nSlidin' in the DM like a Cha Cha\nI got M\u2019s, I can take care of the southside\nI've been buildin' these billionaire ties\nGot the Yves Saint Laurent heels in your size\nGet the penthouse and fill it with vibes\nGot Marc Jacobs, they cover my eyes\nShe need help, I'ma send her a dime\nI can't pour nothing less than

ain't talkin' 'bout buyin' grams then I'm a deaf man\nI can make the dope do numbers, the Stacey Augmon\nI told my bitch to dye her hair red like Dennis Rodman\nIf Gucci Mane got so much money then why he robbin'?\nWe thirty deep, we cover the streets, nigga, we mobbin'\n\n[Hook: Young Thug]\n(It's Guwop), again\nThugger and Guwop, again\nChasin' that Guwop, again\nThat's my lil whoadie,

Young Thug]\nMy bitch white and she brown like port\nEd-umacation abort, bookin' these dorks\nI jumped off the porch and went north\nWhipped you some dope full of narc-cotics\nYSL hardbody, I got

trap music is today.\n\nOn May 26th 2016, Gucci Mane was released from prison after spending two years locked up for possession of a firearm. Just a month later, he released his album Everybody Looking which also featured Jeffery on the track \u201cGuwop Home\u201d.\n\nGUWOP also has a meaning to it, explained by Gucci himself on Twitter: https://twitter.com/gucci1017/status/524742715465277440\n\nOn this track, Jeffery, along with Young Scooter and Quavo and Offset of Migos pay homage to the godfather of trap."}, "comment_count": 2,

because I know you need her\nStart about fake shit, I shall call my people\nShout out to rasta niggas, those my people\nPut down my strap and used these hands, they evil\nTried to be loyal to these foreigns, but I am a cheater\nGot a lot of followers, a perfect leader\nI like it icy cause I'm not a cheap one\nBabe make your booty roll\nI got a lot of hundreds, I wan' see that tootsie roll\nI got

for\nOf course I do it for my bitch and for my crew for sure\nI do it for my jeweler, my ice off a fucking boat\nYou know the routine, little bitch I'm private\nLittle bitch I'm hot, like I'm a Taki\nI knock it out, pussy, just like I'm Rocky\nI got a bunch of wings surrounding my body\n\n[Hook: Young Thug]\nGet it, all my niggas yeah they with it\nCause these pussy niggas hatin'\nThey

time, just like a birdie\nI cop a foreign, I pull off skirting\nBitch is you worth it, you make me nervous\nYou rock them Chrome Hearts, you looking nerdy\nThis ain't no fish n' grits, but this that fishscale\nI let little mama be, I keep her good and well\nBitch I'm an OG, I don't play that tattletale\nBy the time you dress me out, I'ma be done made bail\nI smoke that cookie dough, I drink that Actavis\nMy life a video, I'ma let you caption it\nEnergizer Bunny, you see these carats, ho\nI'm Rey Mysterio, my life on HBO\nThey didn't want me fuck none\nNow they want to suck some, and fuck

she lost in the sauce\nShe needa get hit with the pause\nAfter I fuck her she run through the dawgs\nAnd then I'm rejecting her calls\nI threw a pack over the gate to my niggas 'hind the wall\nRIP Pistol, RIP Mike, I pour out the lean for y'all\nRemember the days I trapped out the bando\nI had a thousand dollars\nYou the same nigga that said I wouldn't make it\nI put in a thousand

finger to rivals\nMichael Jackson, my idol\nStill ducked in a pie hole\nTalk to the plug, every day except Cinco de Mayo\nI still got me a Carlo\nStill got money, Carlo\nYour car running so bad, it stink up the Apollo\nCall my Rollie a Ralo\nCall my AP a app\nI ain't talking seat-belts when I say that I'm  strapped\nI'm in love with my side hoe\nI.. sneak her through the side door\nI'ma show you what we ride for\nI'ma show you what we die for\n\n[Chorus: PnB Rock]\nI'm with the gang, gang, gang and we 'bout to go up\nSwitching lanes, it's a thang, every time we show up\nYou a lame, lame, lame

lane, lane that ain't gon' ever change up\nI blow the brain out the range like a Taz Angel\nHere's R.I.P. to Paul Walker homie got hisstain up\nWe had your main on us, now we got stains on us\nAnd all we gotta do is stay down and come up while they flexin' (What we gotta do?)\nYeah, I got her Indian and she Western\nYeah, I just had sex with one of your best friends\nThen that fast and furious started nesting\nSay I'm bout to go take off on you (Take off on you)\nIs you staying, is you rolling like a scroller? yes you are\nYour ready to take off like a 1980 Coke\nHe know that Instagram shit, are you gon' post that?\n\n[Chorus: PnB Rock]\nI'm with the gang, gang, gang and we 'bout to go up\nSwitching lanes, it's a thang, every time we show up\nYou a lame, lame, lame and you so below

always ready to ride 'cause for the squad, we'll do anything\nStay down, we'll never change\nWe always gon' stay the same\nPut you in check, when you outta place\nI try to tell 'em not to mess with my gang, gang, gang\nWe do what we gotta do and don't complain-plain-plain\nI'm on the road, I'm probably fresh up off the plane, plane, plane\nKnow you heard about me, I do my thang, thang, thang\nI got the world on my back\nI put your girl on her back\nI did it all on my own\nNow there ain't no turning back\nAnd my whole squad got my back\nAnd shawty so bad, I asked her if she repped the gang, she said \"Facts\"\nGang, gang, gang\n\n[Chorus: PnB Rock]\nI'm with the gang, gang, gang and we 'bout to go up\nSwitching lanes, it's a thang, every time we show up\nYou a lame, lame, lame and you so

with his first collaboration with Nicki Minaj since 2014\u2019s \u201cDanny Glover\u201d remix.\n\nThe song was leaked two days ahead of its expected release on April 13, 2018, and it came as somewhat of a surprise to fans considering that Thugger previously said he wouldn\u2019t be releasing any music in 2018.\n\nOn April 10, both artists hinted at the song\u2019s release after they both tweeted the number \u201c3\u201d. Thug\u2019s go-to engineer, Alex Tumay, also joined in, further adding to the speculation."}, "comment_count": 0, "community": true, "custom_preview": null, "has_voters": true, "id": 14296872,

Bonds\nAnd I got a head full of hair like I'm from Amazon, uh\nGlaze that ass like a candle honey, uh\nFerragamo shower shoes for me, uh\nLightbulb, neck got jewels on it, uh\nLike an old school, I

white tees, of course (don't you panic)\nDon't you take this shit for granted, don't you panic\nWhen I put my D in your pants, don't you panic\nWhen I catch up with your bitch, you know I'm smashin'\nI can put her on her feet, oh, oh head gasket\nYou gotta tell me what's wrong\nI can't wait to deep stroke to the mornin'\n'Bout to put my dick in your mouth right when you yawn\nYou gotta put that puss' on my lips whenever I'm on one\nI thank the red doll, so I whip my bum bum\nI'm 'bout to fuck somebody girl off this rum, rum (go 'head)\nI'm chasin' all of these rats like I was Tom

nightmares shaped like you\nYou be blowin' smoke clouds shaped like me\nI be havin' nightmares shaped like you\nYou be blowin' smoke clouds shaped like\nTwo cups, can I drown in my mind, too?\nHear the track, spin it back, catch a vibe, too\nThis the shit that be bad, so bad it's good for you, ayy\nI just thought that you should know\nTake a hit, we can sip like it's medicine\nChemistry, remedy, there's no better than...\nThis the shit that be bad, so bad it's good for you, hey\nSo bad, hey\n\n[Chorus: Young Thug]\nLike family don't matter, oh, oh\nWhat's poppin', what's the deal?\nWhat's

Man\u201d\u2014was the first single released from JEFFERY, the tape previously known as No, My Name is JEFFERY, and Young Thug. This is Thug\u2019s first collaboration with Wyclef Jean, and Thugger later named track one of JEFFERY in his honor.\n\nThe production is handled by Wheezy and Zaytoven\u2019s right hand man, Cassius Jay, who\u2019s influence on the beat is clearest in the keyboard melody found in the pre-hook\u2014which is reminiscent of his mentor Zaytoven\u2019s preferred instrumentation."}, "comment_count": 2,

the phone, you know what I'm saying? When you said you was gon' goddamn do this and that to me when you saw me?\n(freaky-deeky)\nWhere all that at? Oh I thought so\nYou got high a level of confidence, you know what I'm saying\n\n[Chorus: Young Thug]\nYou said you gon' fuck me to death when you see me\nYou said that, you said that\nYou said you gon' do me the worst, I remember you right when you said that\nYou said you gon' kiss from my neck to my chest to my naval and dick and nuts\nWe talked about everything, then you know that we got us some making up\nI lick on that puss on a pill, and I make her stand up like some bunny ears\nI bite on her butt and I suck on her toes and her soul go outta here\nShe look at him like he roadkill and I turned 'round her life like I'm Dr. Phil\nLet's get freaky deeky 'round here\n\n[Post-Chorus: Young Thug]\nSay now, ooh, ooh, ooh\nSay now, ooh, ooh, ooh (I want you to say now)\nSay now, ooh, ooh, ooh (I want you to say now)\nSay now (Jeffery!), ooh, ooh, ooh\n\n[Verse 1: Young Thug]\nI got the door unlocked\nAnd I know right now she'd rather have my dick than a watch (facts)\nAnd I'm not right about everything, but I got a strong feeling she'll take me a charge if we run into the narcs\nAnd I'm seeing all your emotions, came a long way from roaches\nUnwrap the birds, get to rolling\nI ain't never needed nothing brodie\nAll full pocket, macaroni\nRose-gold AP like a token\nBought that bitch a mink, now she cozy\nRather go to jail, I ain't told 'em\nI get excited when I see you\nI'd rather freeze up and get shy when I see you\nI'm daydreaming and I\u2019m steady just strappin' our child in the rearview\nIf you a cool one you a real one\nLet's go to Africa, to the Pilgrim\n\n[Chorus: Young Thug]\nYou said you gon' fuck me to death when you see me\nYou said that, you said that\nYou said you gon' do me the worst, I remember you right when you said that\nYou said you gon' kiss from my neck to my chest to my naval and dick and nuts\nWe talked about everything, then you know that we got us some making up\nI lick on that puss on a pill, and I make her stand up like some bunny ears\nI bite on her butt and I suck on her toes and her soul go outta here\nShe look at him like he roadkill and I turned 'round her life like I'm Dr. Phil\nLet's get freaky deeky 'round here\n\n[Post-Chorus: Young Thug & Quavo]\nSay now, ooh, ooh, ooh\nSay now, ooh, ooh, ooh (I want you to)\nSay now, ooh, ooh, ooh (I want you to)\nSay now (say now), ooh, ooh, ooh\n\n[Verse 2: Quavo]\nLast week she told me we ain't gon' make it past this day\nWe in my house, she wanted me to leave, but where am I gonna stay?\nShe hid the keys in the attic, she even tried to hide my Patek\nPlease stop being petty, I don't want no more spaghetti\nMy side bitch in the driveway, yeah\nWaiting on you to leave, bae, yeah\nYou gotta know, yeah, the time changed\nI don't know what's on your mind frame\nBut I gotta go and gangbang\nThe streets mine so I switch lanes\nYou said \"I won't change\" (won't change)\nYou said \"I won't change\" (won't change)\nI regret I put you up on game (regret it)\nI regret I told your mama \"Life would change,\" (momma)\nYeah, out of all the cash, I put on her\nOut of all the bags, I put on her\nAnd I said I don't brag, I don't boast\nSince you popped the tags, I don't want 'em\nAnd my niggas they been placed the vote\nBut you needed to get off the boat\nI can't blame it on me I said \"No\"\nGot her head so big it explode\n\n[Chorus: Young Thug]\nYou said you gon' fuck me to death when you see me\nYou said that, you said that\nYou said you gon' do me the worst, I remember you right when you said that\nYou said you gon' kiss from my neck to my chest to my naval and dick and nuts\nWe talked about everything, then you know that we got us some making up\nI lick on that puss on a pill, and I make her stand up like some bunny ears\nI bite on her butt and I suck on her toes and her soul go outta here\nShe look at him like he roadkill and I turned 'round her life like I'm Dr. Phil\nLet's get freaky deeky 'round here\n\n[Post-Chorus: Young Thug]\nSay now, ooh, ooh, ooh\nSay now, ooh, ooh, ooh (I want you to)\nSay now, ooh, ooh, ooh (I want you to)\nSay now (say now), ooh, ooh, ooh\n\n[Verse 3: Young Thug]\nLet's make our last toast (Jeffery), she gets the last gulp\nI got some Actavis yeah, I want the last dose\nI got a good cash flow, but I don't want the fast dough\nYoung Thugger got filthy rich, I came right out the rat-hole (facts)\nI smoked a whole leaf, I'm drinking codeine\nI want some head and knees, I don't want no teeth\nI should've called off, I'm bout to OD\nIn her mouth like a golf ball, my two homies\nLay it up on me, I make her squirt on the couch, eww\nPrivate party, only broads here\nWe pass forty caps, no beers (got the forty capsule)\nEvery diamond on me crystal clear\nMolly on me, baby, take it off of me (off of me)\nCAT scan, white stuff on my jeans (lap dance)\nHit it from the back, loosen up her spleen (Aye)\nSay you mine, I'ma take it off and raw dog\n\n[Chorus: Young Thug]\nYou said you gon' fuck me to death when you see me\nYou said that, you said that\nYou said you gon' do me the worst, I remember you right when you said that\nYou said you gon' kiss from my neck to my chest to my naval and dick and nuts\nWe talked about everything, then you know that we got us some making up\nI lick on that puss on a pill, and I make her stand up like some bunny ears\nI bite on her butt and I suck on her toes and her soul go outta here\nShe look at him like he roadkill and I turned 'round her life like I'm Dr. Phil\nLet's get freaky deaky around here\n\n[Post-Chorus: Young Thug]\nSay now, ooh, ooh, ooh\nSay now, ooh, ooh, ooh (I want you to)\nSay now, ooh, ooh, ooh (I want you to)\nSay now, ooh, ooh, ooh"}}, {"title": "Safe", "album": null, "year": "2017-02-23",

York with a puck\nDon't mean you won't get stuck up, up\nAy, I might just tell these hoes my secret\nFirst I like them red like a demon\nA purse, every time lil' momma catch me cheating\nStarburst, I

completed my little mission\nI, put something in your stomach next to your kidney\nI, want nothing to do with none of these lil bitches\nI, want something to do with everything and I'm willing\nTo go to church and ask God there for forgiveness\nFor everything and tell that preacher that I'm gon' remember\nHim bringing You in my life and that's on my children\nFuck all them other hoes talking, they Wendy Williams\nNow your wrist got ice like December\nI pour out the paint like Mutumbo\nI'mma fucking lion like Simba\nAnd, yeah my girl ballin' like Kendra\n\n[Hook]\nI think she ready for a

And my niggas, nigga just, nigga just said, \"bruh I just told them the same shit\". That nigga say he just told these girls that, he knew what I was 'bout to say. That's crazy, cray-cray, I dig though, you know what I'm sayin'?

bangin'\nI got the real hitters with me and they dangerous\nYou can't find 'em on no camera but they no namin'\nWash 'n powder bae I\u2019m tired, I\u2019ve been up all night\nMe and bae Bonnie Clyde, everything we do right\nLove her vibe, love her vibe, she make me feel so nice\nShe 100, the first day we met, she let me fuck all night\n\n[Chorus]\nAh-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, work\nDo the work, baby, do the

though\nI think it's time to take my homies thes ride on a boat\nShow them a good time cause I know they\u2019ll do that for me, oh\n\n[Chorus]\nAh-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, work\nTonight baby, gotta work,

news\nSpent a dime on the red carpet oh, oh\nSo many black chains on, look like a goatee\nI pop pills every week\nYour bitch gon\u2019 suck me, look like she don\u2019t got no teeth\nShe even suck it better than the time she on her knees\nBring a Molly, yeah I\u2019ll see\nI\u2019m smoking pot while you smoke weed\nJust cause I\u2019m signed, don\u2019t mean treat me\n(What's brackin'?)\n\n[Hook:

my niggas one thousand, they get it\nYour niggas, you flexing, and fraudulent\nTwo bitches with me they m\u00e9naging\nI fuck them, then smash them, put them on the market\nI make them go cook and they bring me the money back\nMove in silent like camouflagin'\nShoutout Skippa tha Flippa, came up from nickles\nGreen diamonds like a dill pickle\nEverybody know that I\u2019m in the field\nDrinking and pouring a double seal\nRemember the days when I was road runnin'\nAnd taking trips across the country just for money\nYou fuck with my squad then they start dumpin'\nTake the pot and slam dunk it, Tim Duncan\n\n[Hook: Young Thug]\nNinth grade, quarterback, Washington High\nWhen you in the trap, all these rules apply\nKeep it in your lap, not to the side\nBeen so successful, all your cars

speculate\nFeeling myself but no masturbation\nI\u2019m 22, rich with no education\nThe world\u2019s gonna end one day, read it in Revelations\nGood brain she deserve a scholarship\nThe pistol like lighters, you know that I pocket it\nThese bitches be callin\u2019 my phone\nAnd I\u2019m making, I\u2019m dabbing\nAnd know my diamonds came in from Africa\nSmoking on Salvia that came from El

cause you didn\u2019t have a pistol\nOG gas bag and I flip it like a nickle\nTwo bitches with me nigga, call me Malcolm in the middle\n\n[Hook: Young Thug]\nNinth grade, quarterback, Washington

it like John Cena\nCatch a nigga bitch while I\u2019m eating\nDiamonds on my neck, blinging\nIn the phantom of the opera leaning\nTwo double cup got me feigning\nI dream of genie bitches in bikinis\nThey dreaming for the fettuccine\nPull up and drop my top off like Houdini\nGiuseppe\u2019s on my feet, safari zebras\nMotor fitted, dabbing in the Lee\nSit ya ass down like I\u2019m Beanie

bee\nSmoking OG Moon Rocks mixed with the Diesel\nGivenchy walking on the stars\nLook at these bitches, just eat it up\nJump on the dick, she gon' skin it up\nPull up in a fuckin\u2019 Bentley

thousand dollars for the newest snake collar (snake, yeah)\nVintage swagger (vintage swag), head dollar (ain't playin')\nRock clean, Balmain (c'mon let's get it)\nVintage swag (just vintage hoe), New Celines (just want my glasses)\nHands dirty (hey), watch me turn them clean (clean, clean)\nLil shawty hot (magic), kerosene\nI'ma kill by any means, favorite sound ching-ching\nI spray her face with

shoot you in your head and then it's no more thinking\nPussy boy I'll leave you dead and call it dead-ication\nI put Act inside my drink, they call it medication\n\n[Verse 1: T.I.]\nHold up, pull up, roll up, pour up, ounces in a soda\nPush up on your bitch and shawty I didn't even know her\nSee this hood I throw up, realest one I ever seen\nATL, call it XXL, cause we stay spittin' shells outta

(damn)\nHe told me keep Benz on the race (goddamn)\nUntil you see it like this, I promise man you'd never think it exists\nStraight out a jet to the crib, I'm quick with the switch\nMan we never miss, okay (god-)\n'Bout to turn up in the club, man, back the fuck up\nWe ain't takin' no pictures\nSee all the wings in the front, it's us\nWe had to triple the digits\nSee all those sexy mamas blowing kisses, man\nWe had to grant all they wishes (we grants-)\nCasamigos got me spinnin'\nBut I want some spendin' some out wit' some dealers\nLet's go (goddamn)\n\n[Verse 2: Young Thug]\nI'm rocking Dior Sauvage (damn)\nI'm higher than Scotty, they calling me Pippen (god)\nI got some Cartier vision, it costs me six thousand\nI'm watchin' these women\nMoney's the reason I'm sinning\nMoney's the reason

Jaden Smith]\nOoh, hop out the back of the turn up\nAvoid all the cameras, I did it on purpose\nShe tryna act like she perfect\nI see all the masks that you leave on the surface\nShe made me write all my verses in cursive\nShe need all them purses at Herm\u00e8s\nThat's like 25 racks and we always on a roll\nMan, we always working, let's go\n\n[Verse 4: Young Thug]\nAy, let me pour up some Act, got some brand new graffiti\nIt's going down my back\nI got Chanel slippers, Gucci pennies, baby, girl you can pick\nRocking Giuseppe Zanotti's a night\nI spent half a million designer on kits\nI got Chanel slippers, Gucci pennies, baby girl you can pick\nI got so high, went off the equator, I feel like Buzz Lightyear\nI met a broad, skinny like nails, and I was richer than ice cream\nI had to grind without a rail, now all my cars got Nitron\nStraight to Dubai, I feel like the mail, I was on a Global Express\n\n[Outro: Young Thug]\nI had to grind without a rail, now all my cars got

only (yeah, yeah)\nOnly us, none of y'all other niggas (I know none of y'all can't tell)\nIt's on God\n(I'm in London, got my beat from London)\n\n[Chorus: Young Thug]\nAyy, ayy, I'm drippin' again\nThe way that I drip this shit should be a sin\nAyy, ayy, divorce all my friends\nI'm not a Migo, 'bout to trap out the Benz\nAyy, they told me don't spend\nI went got the racks and I did it again\nAyy, I think she a twin\nPlus she got red calamari skin\nAyy, you don't got no wins\nYou should grab something white and just throw it on in\nI went to school, got suspended\nI told her I want some head, bobby pin\nIf the lil' kid don't got class, yeah we calling truancy\nI ain't had no money to spend\nI got my first check and went paid off my rent\n\n[Verse 1: Jaden Smith & Young Thug]\nI poured a four from the clouds down\nAnd my head floating in bliss (goddamn)\nI'm on the phone with big bro now (damn)\nHe told me keep Benz on the race (goddamn)\nUntil you see it like this, I promise man you'd never think it exists\nStraight out a jet to the crib, I'm quick with the switch\nMan we never miss, okay (god-)\n'Bout to turn up in the club, man, back the fuck up\nWe ain't takin' no pictures\nSee all the wings in the front, it's us\nWe had to triple the digits\nSee all those sexy mamas blowing kisses, man\nWe had to grant all they wishes (we grants-)\nCasamigos got me spinnin'\nBut I want some spendin' some out wit' some dealers\nLet's go (goddamn)\n\n[Verse 2: Young Thug]\nI'm rocking Dior Sauvage (damn)\nI'm higher than Scotty, they calling me Pippen (god)\nI got some Cartier vision, it costs me six thousand\nI'm watchin' these women\nMoney's the reason I'm sinning\nMoney's the reason I gotta take Ritalin\nYou niggas don't care 'bout women\nJust shut the fuck up, yeah I'm taking care plenty\nI put Chanel on a belt buckle, of when my price is half off\nI keep a stick for my cover, got way more girls than Hugh Hefner\nGot the same name as the butler\nBut more money than Ashley and her mother\nGot a backwood full of sherbert, I'm 'bout to smoke like a murder\n\n[Chorus: Young Thug]\nAyy, ayy, I'm dripping again\nThe way that I drip this shit should be a sin\nAyy, ayy, divorce all my friends\nI'm not a Migo, 'bout to trap out the Benz\nAyy, they told me don't spend\nI went got the racks and I did it again\nAyy, I think she a twin\nPlus she got red calamari skin\nAyy, you don't got no wins\nYou should grab something white and just throw it on in\nI went to school, got suspended\nI told her I want some head, bobby pin\nIf the lil' kid don't got class, yeah we calling truancy\nI ain't had no money to spend\nI got my first check and went paid off my rent\n\n[Verse 3: Jaden Smith]\nOoh, hop out the back of the turn up\nAvoid all the cameras, I did it on purpose\nShe tryna act like she perfect\nI see all the masks that you leave on the surface\nShe made me write all my verses in cursive\nShe need all them purses at Herm\u00e8s\nThat's like 25 racks and we always on a roll\nMan, we always working, let's go\n\n[Verse 4: Young Thug]\nAy, let me pour up some Act, got some brand new graffiti\nIt's going down my back\nI got Chanel slippers, Gucci pennies, baby, girl you can pick\nRocking Giuseppe Zanotti's a night\nI spent half a million designer on kits\nI got Chanel slippers, Gucci pennies, baby girl you can pick\nI got so high, went off the equator, I feel like Buzz Lightyear\nI met a broad, skinny like nails, and I was richer than ice cream\nI had to grind without a rail, now all my cars got Nitron\nStraight to Dubai, I feel like the mail, I was on a Global Express\n\n[Outro: Young Thug]\nI had to grind without a rail, now all my cars got Nitron\nStraight to Dubai, I feel like the mail, I was on a Global Express\nI'm in

engineers...\nI mean, one of my newest producers\nI'm high, sorry\n\n[Refrain]\nI pulled up outside in that new big coupe body Benz\nWhen I dress myself I'm the topic, yeah the trend\nUnlike a needle I don't never wanna see the pen\nPile all my yays and I better not never see the lens\nFresh start, I wanna play, baby\nCome love a boss, you my babe, baby\nI'm eatin' like I ain't ate\nAnd I'm workin' like a maid\n\n[Verse 1]\nCome through, won't you see me with my lenses\nI'ma trap it, pitch it, I'ma I press it, then I tint it\nI got falcons in the Honda Civic, I'ma get it\nI got dolphins in the fuckin' fender and they bending\nHelp me eat\nBaby don't let me sit here and bleed\nI got Halloween, trick or treats up my sleeve\nYou can't Future me because she know this me\nShe know this me, she notice me\n\n[Chorus]\nShe know Young Thugger Thugger\nShe notice me, she notice me\nShe know Young Thugger Thugger\nShe notice me, she notice me\nShe know Young Thugger Thugger\nShe notice

start suckin' like ticks\nShe be the truth when she suckin' that dick\nAnd she wanted my milk like a W.I.C\nShe don't play games and she don't go no kids\nBut lil mama say that I'm it\nIce is drippin' like a faucet\nI am hotter than a Taki\nFifth pocket, look like a wallet\nWoah, woah no Kemosabe\nI got Ms like talkin' Miley\nAnd I'm still hot like a pocket\nBaby girl suck on my balls like a basket\nGet a nigga out of dental, tragic\nLil mama my money stretch like elastic\nNo rubber, I might just use plastic\nI'm a real boss, I'ma fuck her and leave her in dirt\nLike a muh'fuckin' Maverick\nAnd I got lucky, I'm lucky muh'fucka\nI might just go play for the Celtics\nI'ma run up with no helper\nIf I get dealt with, get dealt with\nBitch I'm a muh'fuckin' killer\nEarring bigger than a pillow\nEat your main bitch like a Skittle\nBuy my Burberry at Dillard's\nBoy you know that you not realer, a thriller\nBoy you know that you're not built like that\nHit you with 3 like Reggie Miller\nMama askin' how he kill like that\nBig old body Benz\nShe wanna fuck me in my big old body Benz\nShe need to suck me in my big old body Benz\nI won't stop and I won't end\nI swear, I promise\n\n[Refrain]\nI pulled up outside in that new big old body Benz\nWhen I dress myself I'm the topic, yeah the trend\nUnlike a needle I don't never wanna see the pen\nPile all my yays and I

faculty braggin'\nMy briefs, they high fashion\nShe naked, I walk through the door\nI promise, I promise she know\nI pour up a four and got more\nI'm cold as the North fuckin' Pole\nI came a long way from the stove\nI hop in the foreign, go slow\nIced out, ain't no time in it, oh\nOh-oh-oh\n\n[Verse 1]\nI just beat the case\nI hopped out the Benz\nI just fucked some twins\nHad the jewelry in\nI hopped out again\nPulled up in the Range\nGot drank in my cup\nLike I'm Kirko Bangz\nFrom ashy to classy\nKeep up with my ice and my fashion\nI take care of my kid with a passion\nI pray to God that they stay happy\nLil Roscoe, he sleep where it's nasty\nThey could've freed him cause he grew up with no daddy\nBut instead they took advantage and did him badly (fuck)\nAin't give no fucks cause we were saddened\nGot a camera from the club and that's all they had\n(Free the Goat)\nThey also knew that lil' nigga didn't have a wagon\n(Free the Goat)\nDamn\n\n[Chorus]\nAction\nI hop out, I'm

oh\nOh-oh-oh\n\n[Verse 2]\nStop it, stop the killin'\nWe, we get millions\nWe together, get the cheddar (get them racks)\nFuck them niggas, keep a Beretta\nLet 'em have it\nAsk God for forgiveness for them babies\nYou know Slimes with it, baby, baby\nStack them racks up to the ceiling, hey, hey\nFuck you a nigga's old lady\nKeep 'em mad and that's how you know you doin' good\nKeep embarrassin' them with racks that look like books\nI'm so finished, with these bitches\nI need me a real one, I need commitment, where ya at?\n\n[Chorus]\nAction\nI hop out, I'm dabbin'\nMy old lady classy\nWe onto

away\nYou know we can get away\nBecause I'm calling your name\nBecause I'm calling your name\n\n[Verse 1: Young Thug]\nI'ma hit it, never pass it\nBooty fat like she eat asses\nYou can't see, you need glasses\nThey can't see me like masks\nI know a way, I know I need\nI won't misread, specs on when I treat it\nI show my face when it's real\nI'll share my place when it's real\nPromise me that you won't squeal\nI am your doctor, your Phil\nSuck this dick, peppermint, hey baby\nI see you're far, yeah, far, baby\nHercules, Hercules\nI feast on you, you nurse on me\nI love you strongly, they phony\nI'm drunk on her, she all on me\nHaiti slang, girl you the business\nI'm hungry, eat her like Denny's\nOn this Hannah Montana\nTheir jewelry's sunny, yours windy\nEvery day I see you, I wan' fuck you by the pound\nI came to the town, discovered it, lost and found\nBaby you know I am the one that you want right now\nI need two cups whenever I beat it up or down\n\n[Hook: Young Thug]\nShe callin' me Jeffery\nI protect her like a seatbelt\nNigga, money stacked up like 3 shelves\nRun my older hoes off, keep her feet there\nBy myself, I'm on the shore, no seashells\nI hope I'ma ride that bitch like a V12\nAye baby girl don't meet me there, beat me there\nPlus I am a freak like 3 Kels'\nPull on up, baby, pull on up\nGuns R Us, baby, Toys R Us\nI'm livin' that life\nBaby I'm important like in Pedialyte\n\n[Verse 2: Young Thug]\nI'ma put that pussy in saran for yah\nI'ma pop a Xanny for that ass for yah\nI'ma play dead, just like a cask on yah\nI'ma bleed red when I go smash on yah\nSuck this dick, peppermint, hey baby\nI see you're far, yeah, far, baby\nI'ma check that bitch up and down in the street\nAin't gon' hold my head down when they see me\nI'm a lion, nah fuck it, I'm a beast\nBut nigga my water blue like a genie\nToo much money to go to jail, they can't have a freebie\nI bring them racks out the shell, bitch you know they're bleeding\nToo crazy, too crazy\nLike you could be my baby, lady\nThree crazy, three crazy\nI just might come for you like the Navy\nOne crazy, two crazy\nNew coupe Mercedes\nHey I'm just like this\nToo hot, I need a fan, no Tasia\n\n[Hook: Young Thug]\nShe callin' me Jeffery\nI protect her like a seatbelt\nNigga, money stacked up like 3 shelves\nRun my older hoes off, keep her feet there\nBy myself, I'm on the shore, no seashells\nI hope I'ma ride that bitch like a V12\nAye baby girl don't meet me there, beat me there\nPlus I am a freak like 3 Kels'\nPull on up, baby, pull on up\nGots you wrapped, baby, Toys R Us\nI'm livin' that life\nBaby I'm important like in Pedialyte\n\n[Verse 3: Young Thug]\nI just drink that lean on me, I promise ain't goin' broke\nWhen I hit the club, them strippers smile, I give 'em hope\nI know how it feels to be so broke that you got jokes\nI know, I know, I know, I know how to get that paper\nI know, I know how it feels to stack racks up like acres\nI know, I know how it feels, 2,000 channel cable\nAli-ani-ani got me lookin' like the mayor\nWhat you be, Thug? I'm a player\nAnd what, Thug? I'm a slayer\nAnd what, Thug? I make bail\nAnd plus? I won't tell\nYou're a winner, in a Bimmer\nAnd what? And I'm drinkin' 4 ounces in liter\n\n[Hook: Young Thug]\nShe callin' me Jeffery\nI protect her like a seatbelt\nNigga, money stacked up like 3 shelves\nRun my older hoes off, keep her feet there\nBy myself, I'm on the shore, no seashells\nI hope I'ma ride that bitch like a V12\nAye baby girl don't meet me there, beat me there\nPlus I am a freak like 3 Kels'\nPull on up, baby, pull on up\nGots you wrapped, baby, Toys R Us\nI'm livin' that life\nBaby I'm important like in Pedialyte\n\n[Outro: Young Thug and Ellie Goulding]\nYou know we can get away\nBecause I'm calling your name\nYou know we can get away\nBecause I'm calling your name\nYou know we can get away\nBecause I'm calling your name"}}, {"title": "Stunna", "album": "Slime Season", "year": "2015-09-16", "lyrics": "[Hook]\nI'm a fuckin' stunna\nAss big, Hummer\nBirds, Alge Crumpler\nBig B, stung 'em bzzzzz\nSlime, anaconda\nI became a problem\nRollin' OG kush, fungus\nKnow me well, wonder\nPull up on a pussy nigga any second\nYoung Thugga thuggin', pussy, Makaveli\nLeft pocket lettuce, right pocket relish\n17-5, baby, sell it, Thugga!\n\n[Verse 1]\nHop inside the coupe and drop the roof\nCause I'm the mothafuckin' man, you dig?\nMama give me head, nut on her brain\nAnd then I bought the bitch a brand new wig\nI'ma pour up mud and now I'm livin' like a pig\nSigned so many deals I think I got the best sig\nI can write, I can write\nHear no evil, I see no evil\nI ain't kin to Wayne\nBut I called the bitch and now she my mamacita\nBig diamonds on me, mothafuckas lookin' like pimples\nDon't let the fish eye fool you, bitch this a peephole\nPlay with my head, I'll bust your watermelon\nPink, I'm movin' slower than a caterpillar\nI got a hundred thousand hoes, tryna get a million\nI got a hundred thousand coupes and I don't keep the ceiling\nI'm almost at the finish and you niggas still beginning\nI got more money than Martin so I pour up more Remy\nI just got back from Jimmy Fallon, me and T.I.P. sippin'\nFour fours, tryna rob, oh no\n\n[Hook]\nI'm a fuckin' stunna\nAss big, Hummer\nBirds, Alge Crumpler\nBig B, stung 'em\nSlime, anaconda\nI became a problem\nRollin' OG kush, fungus\nKnow me well, wonder\nPull up on a pussy nigga any second\nYoung Thugga thuggin', pussy, Makaveli\nLeft pocket lettuce, right pocket relish\n17-5, baby, sell it\n\n[Verse 2]\n17-5, all my niggas, they gon' ride\nComplete homicide, I'm a earthling in disguise\nWith a foreign body, diamonds wet with no wires\nScrew that bitch with no pliers\nNo charger, pussy, die\nLivin' like a mob boss, pussy nigga no I won't play\nNigga can't stand in front of me\nI got my ice on, bitch ain't nothin' fugazi\nVintage swag, nigga, no 80s\nAnd I don't speak Creole\nBut them niggas, they gon' look out every time I'm in Haiti\nI got more money than you and you and you and you and you too\nI ain't even crippin' but I got a mothafuckin' clue and it's blue\nDamn, and I want you to guess, nigga\nBut if you're wrong, you gon' get the rest, nigga\nI'ma put a lot of metal in his chest just like a vest, nigga\n\n[Hook]\nI'm a fuckin' stunna\nAss big, Hummer\nBirds, Alge Crumpler\nBig B, stung 'em\nSlime, anaconda\nI became a problem\nRollin' OG kush, fungus\nKnow me well, wonder\nPull up on a pussy nigga any second\nYoung Thugga thuggin', pussy, Makaveli\nLeft pocket lettuce, right pocket relish\n17-5, baby, sell it", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4e8296c9aec83af52df1cb35973271fe.600x600x1.jpg", "artist": "Young Thug", "raw": {"annotation_count": 18, "api_path": "/songs/2297175", "apple_music_id": null, "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/2297175/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "Young Thug does it again on this track produced by Issac Flame.

a pussy nigga any second\nYoung Thugga thuggin', pussy, Makaveli\nLeft pocket lettuce, right pocket relish\n17-5, baby, sell it, Thugga!\n\n[Verse 1]\nHop inside the coupe and drop the roof\nCause I'm the mothafuckin' man, you dig?\nMama give me head, nut on her brain\nAnd then I bought the bitch a brand new wig\nI'ma pour up mud and now I'm livin' like a pig\nSigned so many deals I think I got the best sig\nI can write, I can write\nHear no evil, I see no evil\nI ain't kin to Wayne\nBut I called the bitch and now she my mamacita\nBig diamonds on me, mothafuckas lookin' like pimples\nDon't let the fish eye fool you, bitch this a peephole\nPlay with my head, I'll bust your watermelon\nPink, I'm movin' slower than a caterpillar\nI got a hundred thousand hoes, tryna get a million\nI got a hundred thousand coupes and I don't keep the ceiling\nI'm almost at the finish and you niggas still beginning\nI got more money than Martin so I pour up more Remy\nI just got back from Jimmy Fallon, me and T.I.P. sippin'\nFour fours, tryna rob, oh no\n\n[Hook]\nI'm a fuckin' stunna\nAss big, Hummer\nBirds, Alge Crumpler\nBig B, stung 'em\nSlime, anaconda\nI became a problem\nRollin' OG kush,

niggas, they gon' ride\nComplete homicide, I'm a earthling in disguise\nWith a foreign body, diamonds wet with no wires\nScrew that bitch with no pliers\nNo charger, pussy, die\nLivin' like a mob boss, pussy nigga no I won't play\nNigga can't stand in front of me\nI got my ice on, bitch ain't nothin' fugazi\nVintage swag, nigga, no 80s\nAnd I don't speak Creole\nBut them niggas, they gon' look out every time I'm in Haiti\nI got more money than you and you and you and you and you too\nI ain't even crippin' but I got a mothafuckin' clue and it's blue\nDamn, and I want you to guess, nigga\nBut if you're wrong, you gon' get the rest, nigga\nI'ma put a lot of metal in his chest just like a vest, nigga\n\n[Hook]\nI'm a fuckin' stunna\nAss big, Hummer\nBirds, Alge Crumpler\nBig B, stung

that she love me, that\u2019s all\nI wanna clean it with Lysol (fresh)\nShe fuckin' all my buddies, that\u2019s all\n\n[Verse 1]\nShe fuckin' all my buddies\nI might love fuckin' it, but I just cannot love it\nI might catch a nigga bitch and fuck her right on Gresham\nBitch, I am a monster, I know I am a lil' ugly\nI might pull up with all of my jewelry on like Busta\nGot a unique body, my clothes, get \u2018em from Russia\nI might pull up and pimp that bitch just like a sucka\nI don't give a fuck about these lil shrimps, I got my mustard, ketchup, nigga\nNigga loaded pimpin', pimp tight, game right\nI might eat it, I might beat it like Mike Ikes\nTreat that pussy Tempur-Pedic, and call it a night\nShe compliment on my fly, and I ain't talking no flight\nAnd therefore I love her\nShe make a nigga shine without using butter\nMy partner in crime, she won't tell like her mother\nWe don't want no one other, we got one another\nShe know I got her, we got each other\nShe know I'ma grip her weave when I fuck her\nShe know I'ma go over C's like a Blood\nHey baby my name Jeff and Mudd\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nI got me a K in this place\nBaby, don\u2019t play in this place\nYou can call me ace in

can see straight through you like a bullet\nShawty want my closet like a hood\nFuck all of my fellas, no good\nBitch I am a tiger, no wood\nI done see more holes than Tiger Woods\nWhen she with me she just do it\nShe can't fit into these jeans don't do it\n\n[Bridge 1]\nShe remember me\nShe remember everything about me\nShe remember me\nShe remember, she remember everything\nShe remember me\nShe remember me\nShe do it, she do, she do\n\n[Verse 3]\nShe remember I'm a young nigga\nEvery time she sees those racks she wants a son, nigga\nShe know I'm in her mouth just like some gum, nigga\nI might give her my all, then some, nigga\nI'm strapped, my fingers itching, check my palms, nigga\nMy girl gon' relax, and dressed in Toms, nigga\nI got Lil' Bobby say I am a tall nigga\nYou know my cup is pink, like bubblegum, nigga\n\n[Bridge 2]\nEaster pink, pussy wetter than a sink\nI'll get down on my knees\nIf I can't have you you're deceased\nThat means I couldn't be\nBaby, I can't see, curiosity\nIn love with the opposite of me\nDo you dig it?\n\n[Hook]\nFuck a nigga bitch, that\u2019s all\nGrabbin' on my dick, that\u2019s all\nStuntin' with my bitch, that\u2019s all\nGrindin' with

him knocked off for a double sealed pint of lean\nI might get him knocked off while I pull a bank scheme\nI might get him knocked off for just tryna join the team\n\n[Verse 1: Birdman]\nYeah, we roll these bitches like they centipedes\nWe get this money, flip some hundreds then we blow some Gs\nI gave her life and then I showed her Bs\nWe fucked the world but now we overseas\nInside of the car, we stashed a hundred bricks\nWe put it down and hit the town, we 'bout the money trips\nWait, the ice is rollin' cause we're rollin', bitch\nFlakes, the dope is colda cause we're polar, bitch\nI answer the call and put her right beside me\nTwo, we 'bout that woop like them brand new Spyders\nKeep your mouth closed, boy, cause we're aim and fire\nI just might one night her, show love and wife her\nI'm bangin' green like the lizard in Geico\nI pull up and wet you, burn your top like Michael\nI got bullets bigger than fingers in rifles\nIt's big Bs with a hundred Gs in each one of my pockets\n\n[Hook: Young Thug]\nI'm gon' beat that pussy up just like a champion\nI'm a beast inside these streets like a barbarian\nTold my baby next February we're married\nWe laughin' at these pussy

scheme\nI might get him knocked off for just tryna join the team\n\n[Verse 2: Young Thug]\nI'm not gon' pass, I'ma smash 'em\nShe want that nut so I blast her\nMy Bentley grey like a pastor\nWhippin' that snow, no Alaska\nGood head, she got her masters\nShawty a long way from dumb\nYour money flat like a plasma\nGood kush, smoke is the bomb\nI drink that Act while you be drinkin' red\nI don't fall in love, I run over it instead\nHey, babe, bobble, that big ol' head\nI'm like, \"lil baby, I don't know your kid\"\nI keep my pistol I'll give you the lead\nThey 3 deep I call 'em Ed, Edd and Eddy\nBaby take a picture,  get that photo cred\nShe make me lean back like a sofa bed\n\n[Hook: Young Thug]\nI'm gon' beat that pussy up just like a champion\nI'm a beast inside these streets like a

This is immediately funny, since 95% of the population does not know what Young Thug is talking about or even understand the words that he is saying.

she don't do it I know someone that will\nYou know the deal\nI don't want to drink no lean with these niggas if it's not double sealed\nAnd that's the real\nNigga big B balling no budget\nAnd my car

jewelry, yes it's flooded\nTake that dick up out her coochie, then I butt it\nAll these niggas with me blooded, like we cutted\n\n[Chorus]\nNigga how the hell you gon' tell me what's mine?\nI remember on the block I was serving them dimes\nYeah, how the hell you gon' tell me what's mine?\nAnd them boys they had no dope I was selling you mine\nHow the hell you gon' tell me what's mine?\nLittle nigga

these cats run out of the house?\nHouston, Texas when I'm on land, I lean back like a couch\nI'm not playin', I want it bad, call shots like a spouse\nWe roll that kushy up, we eat that pussy though\nSuck it til you're throwin' up, my Phantom grey, no hound\nI lost a Lear, no bucks, still waitin' on that Bentley truck\nStop playin', lil bitty boy, you a duck\nHe ain't YSL, nigga, he ain't in the hut\nI might stop by and let that little bitch lush\nI pull up and chop at your cousin, your bus\nLittle nigga, you know what it was\nYou know what it is, you know what it does\nI'm makin' your old lady shake it\nShe suckin' too slow, I'm impatient\nMy diamonds so wet like a basin\nDon't know where to go, I'm amazin'\n\n[Hook: Jacquees]\nWhat's amazin'?

milk\nI'm sittin' at the top lookin' down at these wimps\nThese hoes just roll me a blunt\nAnd you know that they stuff it, it cannot be imps\nI never had cutlass and donks\nI based up my bankroll then based out my trunk\nI might fuck that lil bitch in the mornin'\nI might put her out and call Tyrone\nSnoop Dogg, I might go ahead and bone\nI'm big ballin', bitch put me inside the dome\nI'm

her, leave her, fuck her\nI don't wait up, hold up, let me check my mail\nHe broke, he servin' his squad with a scale\nI make it rain, I hope all is well\nI pull off deep like what in the hell?\nHoe give all my niggas some bails\nWait I'ma lay down 'fore I'll tell\nPull up in old school Chevelles\nI don't save pictures, they might get revealed\nHow many times have I asked are you well?\nHow many

ever dreamed?\nI was the man and you a thing\nOne and two\nAnytime I get mad, I can goodbye to you\nGod damn, who the hell let rats in the house?\nKing of lions, who let these cats run out of the house?\nHouston, Texas when I'm on land, I lean back like a couch\nI'm not playin', I want it bad, call shots like a spouse\nWe roll that kushy up, we eat that pussy though\nSuck it til you're throwin' up, my Phantom grey, no hound\nI lost a Lear, no bucks, still waitin' on that Bentley truck\nStop playin', lil bitty boy, you a duck\nHe ain't YSL, nigga, he ain't in the hut\nI might stop by and let that little bitch lush\nI pull up and chop at your cousin, your bus\nLittle nigga, you know what it was\nYou know what it is, you know what it does\nI'm makin' your old lady shake it\nShe suckin' too slow, I'm impatient\nMy diamonds so wet like a basin\nDon't know where to go, I'm amazin'\n\n[Hook: Jacquees]\nWhat's amazin'? I don't know\nWhat's amazin'? I don't know\nWhat's amazin'? I don't know\nWhat's amazin'?

rocking gold like Rols-R-Us\nI talk more shit than Damien does\nI put the steel up and stain lil cuz\nI, I, I, I be that Young Thugger Thug\nThrowing these bitches straight off of the boat\nWe don't save them\nHey, a wise man told me nothin'\nHe said them snitches they get stitches\nI just spent a Bentley on my kidneys\nSaying I gave my bro the address to road to riches\n\n[Hook]\nI, I might just take care of bae\nYeah, I might just make her my latest\nOn my worse day she a 9 like Brady\nBut I traded in the Keisha or Kaycee's\nYeah, she love me, she love me, love me for that\nYeah, she love me, she love me, love me for that\nYeah, she love it, I'm honest she loving that\nYeah, my love is so big she can't lose that\n\n[Interlude]\nThugger\nAy, yeah, yeah\nSing to her, yeah\nThat's how you do it nigga\nThat's how you motherfucking do it nigga\nPeep this, ay\n\n[Verse 2]\nL-O-V-E, I say lil mama down to ride and die for me\nOkay, you green no seaweed\nPsych, I want you to hurry get into me\nI drop like ten thousands ones on her lil buns\nI told her come on home hun\nYou can have my son\nWe eat ching chong, diamonds they go boing\nHop inside that pussy like a trampoline, boing boing\nHey wait\nGrab that lil ass by the way\nBeep beep beep like a bus on that ass, so big\nI swear to god I'mma fuck her now her body getting big\nI swear to god I'mma do everything that I ain't did\nPlus brodie said that bitch pussy bright pink as a pig\n\n[Hook]\nI, I might just take care of bae\nYeah, I might just make karat my ladies\nOn my worse day she a 9 like Brady\nBut I traded in

tell you what, I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what\nBitches jump me and I tell that hoe to help my buzz\nI don't got no reason to be cheating on that lil girl (fuck her)\nStop it, I'm just kidding, I get new hoes by the month\nI get agitated, you decapitated\nI'm too educated to be 'round here hating\nI build up my acres like a landscaper\nMolly put me to sleep and a Xan awake us\nI'm different

Laker, nigga\nFuck in the car wash, I can wet it up myself\nGot me stuck on first base, I can't take no other step\nShe gon' treat me good without crutches, I need her help\nDon't wanna be the odd

turf's the worst it's gon' get (It's gon' get)\nWhipped up water on my wrist, came from a fish (Young BL$$D, boy, you saucin')\n\n[Chorus]\nDip and dab out the bag (Dab out the bag)\nI got Crips on Old Nat (Got Crips on Old Nat)\nYou don't want problems for somethin' (Don't want problems for somethin')\nNeed to get you some racks (Need to get you some racks)\nShe gon' bring it to Daddy (She gon' bring it to daddy)\nEat the cake out her panties (Eat the cake out her panties)\nI was cool as a cat (I was cool as a cat)\nState all facts\nIf I wouldn't have rapped, I'd still be rich (Still rich)\nThree million dollar house, came from evictions (Hood rich)\nOut here on a jet and a cruise ship (Cruise ship)\nLast night I stole the yacht to cruise in it (Cruise in it)\nIf I wouldn't have rapped, I'd still be rich (Hood rich)\nIf I ain't have this shit, I'd still be lit (Hood rich)\nIf I fuck these hoes, then I'm trippin' (I'm trippin')\nI can't fuck these hoes, they might try to pull a trick (And what?)\nAin't no slippin' (Let's go)\n\n[Verse]\nThe coupe is outside and I'm styled in the best (Yeah)\nI see you killin' these niggas, you doin' it the best\nSolitaries, ain't nothing, to me\nCoca leaves like I got leukemia\nFor real, la familia, I go gorilla, I'm part of the Bape team\nFuck you thought?\nSupreme Louis quilt, hang low as a drag queen\nI'm in a bronze Benz, I think it's the wagon\nEver since mom's titty, bitch I was flaggin' (Woop, woop)\nShe got some water on, she my Cancun thing (She my Cancun thing)\nI got some black diamonds, my wrist is on Beijing (My wrist is on Beijing)\nI'm tellin' all of my hoes give they orders to the maid (Hold on, turn up)\nI got 20 bitches with me and they ain't throwin' shade (Woo, woo)\nI got 20 closets, I could dress accordin' to the wave (Yeah, yeah)\nI'm with 20 models, but I dress accordin' to the bae (Hah)\nI'm goin' all in 'bout my bro and my paper (What?)\nAin't got no fuckin' neighbors (And what?)\nAin't got no neighbors\nYeah\nNo neighbors, oh\n\n[Chorus]\nDip and dab out the bag\nI got Crips on Old Nat\nYou don't want problems for somethin'\nNeed to get you some racks\nShe gon' bring it to daddy\nEat the cake out her panties\nI was cool as a cat\nState all facts\nIf I wouldn't have rapped, I'd still be rich (Hood rich)\nIf I ain't have this shit, I'd still be lit (Hood rich)\nIf I fuck these hoes,

at the court counter there with a mink coat on\nGot a fat ass and some D cups on\nCall her at Popeyes, we can link up later on\nNigga aired out the spot now we can't link later on\nI just want to flirt with you, want to flirt with you ya\nTook it straight from a boy\nNow I don't know what to do with you ya\nI don't care what y'all think nigga just do you aye\nI was teachin' my dawg like I was Blues Clues aye\nI just picked a 40 up on the back end\nGot lil mama in the room running back in\nI just popped a molly now I'm going back in\nNo features I don't do features\nI don't like leeches and I done had enough of these leakers yea\n\n[Hook]\nIf Texas love was a drug (You\u2019d belong to me)\nIf Texas love was a drug (You\u2019d belong to me)\nIf Texas, Texas, Texas was a drug\nIf Texas,

hundred bodies and they all idols\nI first heard that they all 'bout it\nBut these niggas ain't even fightas\nAnd these niggas ain't even buyers\nI heard they leasing everything they ridin' in\nAnd all they kids passed out in the play pen\nMade a million dollars I'm amazing\nThey was popping collars I was patient\nThat's a massive foul nigga flagrant\nGot on hella chains like a slave bitch\nAnd I'm at it never comtemplatin'\nNigga gripping tan up the damn street\nR.I.P. to Bankroll Fresh street\nNiggas ridin' tan up the S40\nThe Maserati like the Kash Doll\nWhen the drought come bring them bags out\nI'm in LA bring the plaid out\nPut the monkey bitches lookin' sad out\nWatch a rich nigga issue cash out\n\n[Hook]\nIf Texas love was a drug (You\u2019d belong to me)\nIf Texas love was a

would do a hundred year 'bout it\nLong as it get me right\nLong as it get me round\nI'mma burn the house down\nIf Texas was a drug\nIf Texas showed the love\nI meant, they showed love so if Texas was a drug\nI'd never never share\nI want it all in my belly\nI wan it all in my neck\nI want it all in my hair\nI want it all on my bae\nI want it all in my spot\nI want it all in the mansion\nI want to

bout em I got 'em woah\nFendi with Prada, need no stylists I dress clothes\nDressing in style and Pat Rileys\nI'mma let you ride it while I bite it\nAye baby can we lay up, can we lay up\nBlack nigga at the court counter there with a mink coat on\nGot a fat ass and some D cups on\nCall her at Popeyes, we can link up later on\nNigga aired out the spot now we can't link later on\nI just want to flirt with you, want to flirt with you ya\nTook it straight from a boy\nNow I don't know what to do with you ya\nI don't care what y'all think nigga just do you aye\nI was teachin' my dawg like I was Blues Clues aye\nI just picked a 40 up on the back end\nGot lil mama in the room running back in\nI just popped a molly now I'm going back in\nNo features I don't do features\nI don't like leeches and I done had enough of these leakers yea\n\n[Hook]\nIf Texas love was a drug (You\u2019d belong to me)\nIf Texas love was a drug (You\u2019d belong to me)\nIf Texas, Texas, Texas was a drug\nIf Texas, Texas, Texas was a drug, drug, drug, drug, drug\n\n[Break]\nDrug, drug, drug\nI gahdamn\nSell the fuck out\nI mean I wouldn't be able to keep a pack\nYou know what I'm saying\nHow you digg that\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou can take a ride through the lime light\nI can take a ride through the wild life\nI can kick game like the Pied Piper\nYSL Denzel sniper\nHundred bands in the damn Bible\nI got a hundred bodies and they all idols\nI first heard that they all 'bout it\nBut these niggas ain't even fightas\nAnd these niggas ain't even buyers\nI heard they leasing everything they ridin' in\nAnd all they kids passed out in the play pen\nMade a million dollars I'm amazing\nThey was popping collars I was patient\nThat's a massive foul nigga flagrant\nGot on hella chains like a slave bitch\nAnd I'm at it never comtemplatin'\nNigga gripping tan up the damn street\nR.I.P. to Bankroll Fresh street\nNiggas ridin' tan up the S40\nThe Maserati like the Kash Doll\nWhen the drought come bring them bags out\nI'm in LA bring the plaid out\nPut the monkey bitches lookin' sad out\nWatch a rich nigga issue cash out\n\n[Hook]\nIf Texas love was a drug (You\u2019d belong to me)\nIf Texas love was a drug (You\u2019d belong to me)\nIf Texas, Texas, Texas was a drug\nIf Texas, Texas, Texas was a drug, drug, drug, drug, drug\n\n[Outro]\nI said if Texas love was a drug\nI would never give it up\nI would do a hundred year 'bout it\nLong as it get me right\nLong as it get me round\nI'mma burn the house down\nIf Texas was a drug\nIf Texas showed the love\nI meant, they showed love so if Texas was a drug\nI'd never never share\nI want it all in my belly\nI wan it all in my neck\nI want it all in my hair\nI want it all on my bae\nI want it all in my spot\nI want it all in the mansion\nI want to fuck on your thot\nYour baby momma at the spot\nYou was tripping cause I had your baby momma at the spot\nShe was with my hoe though nigga"}}, {"title": "Tattoos", "album": "Slime Season 3", "year":

that he a cat like Tigger\n(For sure, for sure)\nBeat the pussy nigga with the baseball bat\nPull up with them F&Ns comin' out the hatch\nPussy mothafucka scared to say it to my front\nSo I'm blowin' out his back\nPoint it at his liver, make the nigga reconsider\nBands in my pants got me lookin' a little bigger\nRed just like Elmo but I never fuckin' giggle\nYou can suck my pickle for a nickel\n\n[Hook: Young Thug]\nEww eww eww\nEww eww eww, eww\n\n[Verse 2: Young Thug]\nHow many niggas standin' around you would die for you?\nI\u2019m not bein' funny but if I come through there sprayin'\nAll them niggas turn to 4 wheelers\nHonestly, truth be told, YSL won't fold\nPick his ass off from the balcony\nWalk into the house and change clothes\nYSL, wipe a nigga nose\nWe don't give a damn if it's indoors or outdoors\nWe gotta have that, gon' grab that\nNigga go stab that, smack that shit\nEvery day I keep the bands on me, I'm a lick\nIf a nigga think I'm sweet then his tongue gettin' split\nI ain't doin' any features unless you give me your bitch\nI'ma fuck for the cash then she gettin' robbed by Tick\n\n[Hook: Young Thug]\nEww eww eww\nEww eww eww, eww\n\n[Verse 3: Young Thug]\nHundred bands inside of my pants\nMake the mothafucka dance on the stage\nAye, bitch, it's a parade\nPourin' 4s is a sport, Leanorade\n50 whole k spent on my hygiene\nDrinkin' so much lean that my pee clean\n808 just might be the dream team\nBitch got some good brain, call her Pinky\nBag full of weed, no lighter\nIn the kitchen wrappin', rappin' like a cypher\nYou know damn well, I like her, I'mma bite her\nIn a Bentley on West Lee gettin' trailed by sniper\nHow the fuck you feel that I don't mean nothin'?\nAll them years in the bando, no clean nothin'\nRunnin' to the cops, tell 'em I don't serve the fiend nothin'\nPullin' off like \"SIKE!\"\nBitch I got the bando, fifty hundreds\nSpot 'round the corner filled up with onions\nBig homie got a whole truckload\nMe and Scooter take a trip to New Mexico\nAll I ever wanted was the money\nAll I ever wanted was the money\nPut your hands in the air if you dare\nAny motherfucker to step over here\nF&N put 'em in a wheel chair\n\n[Hook:

like two weeks ago that I was pimp\nI don't stack that shit by the four \u2018cause I\u2019m not a shrimp\nMan I do it, put that shit on everything she know I do it\nFuck that work I might not do it (sike!)\nLike my daddy or the school, I might listen to it\n\n[Verse 1]\nMy clothes they by Elizabeth Taylor baby\nFuck on your lil bitch and get to moving with the skaters baby\nI can go around the bitch like equators baby\nAnd I feel free like the mothafuckin' nature baby\nThat lil bitch fit the description like a blazer baby\nAnd she from L.A. just like the mothafuckin' Laker baby\nImma fire shots off like I know Brian Nichols\nI just might ride or die for my niggas\nThey talkin' life sentence I'll try with my niggas\nAnd I will beat trial with my niggas\nHow you gon' eye my niggas?\nTell me, how you gon' try my niggas?\nHow you goin' back and forth \u2018bout my niggas?\nFlaws and all my nigga\n\n[Bridge]\nFlaws and all, fell in wit my dawgs\nFlaws and all, even with my paw\nVersace drawers for your broad\nFlaws and all\n\n[Hook]\nRos\u00e9 goin right inside the kitchen\nI might be a lame if I don't pay that ho tuition\nI find out like two weeks ago that I was pimp\nI don't stack that shit by the four \u2018cause I\u2019m not a shrimp\nMan I do it, put that shit on everything she know I do it\nFuck that work I might not do it (Psyche!)\nLike my daddy or the school, I might listen to it\n\n[Verse 2]\nTell me how you see a nigga take the spots, and knock a nigga straight off his spots\nI mean how the fuck you think you gon beat the Thugger\nDefeat the Thugger, Don\u2019t bleach Young Thugger\nI mean how the fuck, you\u2019ll need the Thugger\nYou\u2019ll please the Thugger, you\u2019ll eat the Thugger\nNo leasing Thugger, yeah, No leasing Thugger\nThe bitch so clean it's a shame no one love her\nYeah, never love these bitches\nWhen I ran my' money up I started duckin' these bitches\nShe eat the dick so much, I ain't never seen the bitch in the mofuckin' kitchen\nBaby I love you, in a house full of grown folks, baby I love you\nSwear to God, you my bread & butter\nYou can get my all if the Feds destroy us\nI'ma keep my feet in these streets\nLike a \u201cd\u201d we can go straight overseas\nPut purple in my brain just like a leaf\nIf the bitch got class, yea she can come with me\nI ain't gotta tell these hoes, they know I\u2019m prince of the city\nI just might pull up with bad bitches and take em to the trenches\n\n[Hook]\nRos\u00e9 goin right inside the kitchen\nI might be a lame if I don't pay that ho tuition\nI find out like two weeks ago that I was pimp\nI don't stack that shit by the four \u2018cause I\u2019m not a shrimp\nMan I do it, put that shit on everything she know I do it\nFuck that work I might not do it (Psyche!)\nLike my daddy or the school, I might listen to it\n\n[Bridge]\nFlaws and all, fell in wit my dawgs\nFlaws and all, even with my paw\nVersace drawers for your broad\nFlaws and all"}}, {"title": "Up (SS2)",
