(What's crackin'?)\nHit this shit (Shit, I almost hit this motherfucker today)\nPsh, is that right? (What is it with motherfuckers thinkin' that\nBecause we're in the spotlight, or whatever, that\nThey can do or say whatever they want to us\nAnd that we won't retaliate?)\nProtect my motherfuckin self, by any means necessary (Right)\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\n\u2018Cause you don't know me, I don't know you\nSo don't approach me, I won't approach you\nAnd don't insult me, I won't insult you\n\u2018Cause you don't know what I will or I won't do\n\n[Verse 1: Xzibit]\nMake no mistake, I'm the Golden State heavyweight\nBeing underrated gave me time to create\nCan you relate? I renovate, straight out the gate\nCarried my weight, but seem to receive nothin' but hate\nMillionaires snatchin' crumbs off my little son plate\nKidnapped, locked in a trunk, get shot in the face\nNo hoes, no clothes, no one showin' up for my shows\nYou know how it goes, I might as well kick it at home\nBut my baby mama hate my guts and can't stand me\nPacked up, moved out, started a new family\nSo all this strugglin' for what, so I can blow up?\nMarry a slut but can't watch my seed grow up?\nFuck that! This the fuckin' thanks I get\nFor tryin' to edutain assholes and feed my bitch?\nYo, I feel like my whole life is upside down\n\u2018Cause you seein' more support than I'm seein' my child\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nIt's like, every day I wake up, another drama\nIt's a wonder I'm alive survivin' this karma\nIf I can hold on to my private life for five minutes longer\nI might get my wife to let go of this knife and just calm her\nWithout these cameras in our faces like animals\nFor your Channel 2 Action News\nTo follow our ambulance up the avenue\nAnd catch a glimpse of all the suicide attempts\nAnd what we do in private since they won't let us put up a fence\nAnd you wonder why I carry every gun under the sun\nWhether it's unloaded, full or an unregistered one\nNo bullets? You're so full of shit\nThis clip is so full, it'll spit if I don't pull it\nAnd don't give me no bullshit, I'm not in the mood\nI just got in a feud in some parking lot with a dude\nOver Kim, and she just slit both of her wrists over this shit\nDon't tell me 'bout the show business shit\nI know what this is, bitch\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\n\u2018Cause you don't know me, I don't know you\nSo don't approach me, I won't approach you\nAnd don't insult me, I won't insult you\n\u2018Cause you don't know what I will or I won't do\n\n[Verse 3: Xzibit]\nThis ain't business, this is personal, bitch\nYou don't know Xzibit from shit, new school, class dismissed\nI had a very fucked up day, I'm needin' this fifth\nShuttin' motherfuckers up like they pleadin' the fifth\nYo, Em, it's time to get serious with it\nTime for everybody to feel it, similar to the egg in the skillet\nThis is your brain on drugs, Xzibit brain on thugs\nAin't no neighborhood that's big enough to bang on us\nAin't no love lost, my niggas, relax yourself\nI'm about to snatch it all and start spreadin' the wealth\nTo my niggas who never seen it, I mean it\nWhen I holla at the top of my lungs\nAbout my guns and my loved ones\nGot tons of ammo to crack your enamel\nChangin' your channel, you played like a fuckin' piano\nRidin' slow through Cali like I'm ridin' a camel\nMillionaire motherfuckers with their brains in their flannels\nI feel like Tony Soprano: who do I trust now?\nJust hit me on my tele', nigga, soon as I touch down\nSpit lines to split spines, just to get mine\nBig behind bitches gettin' dick to spit shine\nSniff lines of coke \u2013 that's the only shit that make you dope\nBitch-ass nigga that's droppin' the soap\nGet choked out and beat, put your head in a vise-grip\nAnd turn 'til you motherfuckers tell me the right shit\n\n[Verse 4: Eminem]\nSo do I gotta buy a whole block to myself, a front door with twelve locks\nAnd have a bodyguard walk me out to my mailbox\nAnd every time somebody makes a threat, run and tell cops?\nFuck that! I protect myself with these twelve shots\nAnd one in the chamber, gun in the waist\nAnd one in the ankle, waitin' for someone to come to my place\nTryna walk up and knock, like these cocksuckers are not\nGonna get a shotgun or a Glock shoved in their face\nAnd it's a disgrace Hailie can't play with her toys\nIn the front yard without you drivin' by honkin' your horn\nScreamin' some shit, leanin' out your windows, beepin' and shit\nOr pullin' up in my drive like I won't leap in your whip\nAnd so these kids tell their friends and relatives where I live\nSo my address ends up on the Internet again\nSo then, I do an interview with Spin, tellin' them\nThat if someone comes to my crib, I'ma shove a gun in their ribs\nAnd reporters blow it out of proportion\nOh, now he's pullin' guns on his fans\nJust for tryin' to stand on his porch\nAnd I'm the bad guy, \u2018cause I don't answer my door, like, \"Hey! Hi! You guys wants some autographs? Okay, form a straight line!\"\nSometimes I feel like loadin' this rifle\nAnd climbin' the roof at night and hidin' outside to snipe you\nIt's not that I don't like you\nIt's just that when I'm not behind the mic, I'm a person who's just like you", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f4bfc0bd71618d669bf1329d01f4e517.600x601x1.jpg", "artist": "Xzibit", "raw": {"annotation_count": 16, "api_path": "/songs/1390", "apple_music_id": "267921382", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/1390/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "Off Xzibit\u2019s 2000 album Restless.

"[Intro: Xzibit & (Eminem)]\nPssh, man, I need a lighter, man (Right here!)\nYeah\u2026 whassup, Slim? (What's crackin'?)\nHit this shit (Shit, I almost hit this motherfucker today)\nPsh, is that right? (What is it with motherfuckers thinkin' that\nBecause we're in the spotlight, or whatever, that\nThey can do or say whatever they want to us\nAnd that we won't retaliate?)\nProtect my motherfuckin self, by any means necessary (Right)\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\n\u2018Cause you don't know me, I don't know you\nSo don't approach me, I won't approach you\nAnd don't insult me, I won't insult you\n\u2018Cause you don't know what I will or I won't do\n\n[Verse 1: Xzibit]\nMake no mistake, I'm the Golden State heavyweight\nBeing underrated gave me time to create\nCan you relate? I renovate, straight out the gate\nCarried my weight, but seem to receive nothin' but hate\nMillionaires snatchin' crumbs off my little son plate\nKidnapped, locked in a trunk, get shot in the face\nNo hoes, no clothes, no one showin' up for my shows\nYou know how it goes, I might as well kick it at home\nBut my baby mama hate my guts and can't stand me\nPacked up, moved out, started a new family\nSo all this strugglin' for what, so I can blow up?\nMarry a slut but can't watch my seed grow up?\nFuck that! This the fuckin' thanks I get\nFor tryin' to edutain assholes and feed my bitch?\nYo, I feel like my whole life is upside down\n\u2018Cause you seein' more support than I'm seein' my child\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nIt's like, every day I wake up, another drama\nIt's a wonder I'm alive survivin' this karma\nIf I can hold on to my private life for five minutes longer\nI might get my wife to let go of this knife and just calm her\nWithout these cameras in our faces like animals\nFor your Channel 2 Action News\nTo follow our ambulance up the avenue\nAnd catch a glimpse of all the suicide attempts\nAnd what we do in private since they won't let us put up a fence\nAnd you wonder why I carry every gun under the sun\nWhether it's unloaded, full or an unregistered one\nNo bullets? You're so full of shit\nThis clip is so full, it'll spit if I don't pull it\nAnd don't give me no bullshit, I'm not in the mood\nI just got in a feud in some parking lot with a dude\nOver Kim, and she just slit both of her wrists over this shit\nDon't tell me 'bout the show business shit\nI know what this is, bitch\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\n\u2018Cause you don't know me, I don't know you\nSo don't approach me, I won't approach you\nAnd don't insult me, I won't insult you\n\u2018Cause you don't know what I will or I won't do\n\n[Verse 3: Xzibit]\nThis ain't business, this is personal, bitch\nYou don't know Xzibit from shit, new school, class dismissed\nI had a very fucked up day, I'm needin' this fifth\nShuttin' motherfuckers up like they pleadin' the fifth\nYo, Em, it's time to get serious with it\nTime for everybody to feel it, similar to the egg in the skillet\nThis is your brain on drugs, Xzibit brain on thugs\nAin't no neighborhood that's big enough to bang on us\nAin't no love lost, my niggas, relax yourself\nI'm about to snatch it all and start spreadin' the wealth\nTo my niggas who never seen it, I mean it\nWhen I holla at the top of my lungs\nAbout my guns and my loved ones\nGot tons of ammo to crack your enamel\nChangin' your channel, you played like a fuckin' piano\nRidin' slow through Cali like I'm ridin' a camel\nMillionaire motherfuckers with their brains in their flannels\nI feel like Tony Soprano: who do I trust now?\nJust hit me on my tele', nigga, soon as I touch down\nSpit lines to split spines, just to get mine\nBig behind bitches gettin' dick to spit shine\nSniff lines of coke \u2013 that's the only shit that make you dope\nBitch-ass nigga that's droppin' the soap\nGet choked out and beat, put your head in a vise-grip\nAnd turn 'til you motherfuckers tell me the right shit\n\n[Verse 4: Eminem]\nSo do I gotta buy a whole block to myself, a front door with twelve locks\nAnd have a bodyguard walk me out to my mailbox\nAnd every time somebody makes a threat, run and tell cops?\nFuck that! I protect myself with these twelve shots\nAnd one in the chamber, gun in the waist\nAnd one in the ankle, waitin' for someone to come to my place\nTryna walk up and knock, like these cocksuckers are not\nGonna get a shotgun or a Glock shoved in their face\nAnd it's a disgrace Hailie can't play with her toys\nIn the front yard without you drivin' by honkin' your horn\nScreamin' some shit, leanin' out your windows, beepin' and shit\nOr pullin' up in my drive like I won't leap in your whip\nAnd so these kids tell their friends and relatives where I live\nSo my address ends up on the Internet again\nSo then, I do an interview with Spin, tellin' them\nThat if someone comes to my crib, I'ma shove a gun in their ribs\nAnd reporters blow it out of proportion\nOh, now he's pullin' guns on his fans\nJust for tryin' to stand on his porch\nAnd I'm the bad guy, \u2018cause I don't answer my door, like, \"Hey! Hi! You guys wants some autographs? Okay, form a straight line!\"\nSometimes I feel like loadin' this rifle\nAnd climbin' the roof at night and hidin' outside to snipe you\nIt's not that I don't like you\nIt's just that when I'm not behind the mic, I'm a person who's just like you"}}, {"title": "Say My Name", "album": "Man vs Machine", "year": "2002-10-01", "lyrics": "[Intro: Eminem]\nThis ain't beef man\nI don't know what the fuck to call it\nBut no beef\nWhat up X\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nI float like B.I.G.'s spirit in this bitch I'm ghostly\nRush me, cause you ain't gonna live to roast me\nI'd have my motherfucking ass kicked by Moby\nIf I let some bitch in the Can like Bis cop over me\nTo do war and try to bring my crew back down\nI'll never stoop to that level to do that now\nI got a new cat, this time I'm pulling two gats out\nWith bullets, I finally got something to shoot at now\n\n[Verse 2: Xzibit]\nLet's see who got they city on lock\nLet's see who got the better aim with the Glock\nLet's see who come out on top\nLet's see who really want their name in the streets\nLet's see who wanna die the same time as me\nAnd make ends meet\nNow was I blessed with a gift or cursed with a curse\nI follow hearse after hearse with verse after verse\nAnd I'll be damned if I let Billy dance Dupri\nOr anybody swing an axe at my family tree\nSo now ...\n\n[Chorus: Nate Dogg]\nI love it when you niggas be talking, saying my name\nSeems like your mouth is not connected to your brain\nTwo-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same\nBetter have a strap my nigga, simple and plain\nPut your nuts on the table, my nigga let's play the game\nHurt you so long, you'll be a-ddicted to pain\nI don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain\nRight before you lay in your coffin, ho, say my name\n\n[Verse 3: Xzibit]\nWhy do you hate me ?\nI came from nothing, blood sweat and tears, you did not create me\nHow can you doubt me?

up X\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nI float like B.I.G.'s spirit in this bitch I'm ghostly\nRush me, cause you ain't gonna live to roast me\nI'd have my motherfucking ass kicked by Moby\nIf I let some bitch in the Can like Bis cop over me\nTo do war and try to bring my crew back down\nI'll never stoop to that level to do that now\nI got a new cat, this time I'm pulling two gats out\nWith bullets, I finally got something to shoot at now\n\n[Verse 2: Xzibit]\nLet's see who got they city on lock\nLet's see who got the better aim with the Glock\nLet's see who come out on top\nLet's see who really want their name in the streets\nLet's see who wanna die the same time as me\nAnd make ends meet\nNow was I blessed with a gift or cursed with a curse\nI follow hearse after hearse with verse after verse\nAnd I'll be damned if I let Billy dance Dupri\nOr anybody swing an axe at my family tree\nSo now ...\n\n[Chorus: Nate Dogg]\nI love it when you niggas be talking, saying my name\nSeems like your mouth is not connected to your brain\nTwo-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same\nBetter have a strap my nigga, simple and plain\nPut your nuts on the table, my nigga let's play the game\nHurt you so long, you'll be a-ddicted to pain\nI don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain\nRight before you lay in your coffin, ho, say my name\n\n[Verse 3: Xzibit]\nWhy do you hate me ?\nI came from nothing, blood sweat and tears, you did not create me\nHow can you doubt me? You don't know shit about me\nThere'd be no West coast without me\nCut with the bullshit, I struggle for survival\nAnd now you trying to act like my rival\nWatch what you say partner, it's a small earth\nDon't play games with your life, nigga, it's not worth\nAll the pain (all the pain), all the agony (all the agony)\nAll the horror (all the horror), all the tragedy (all the tragedy)\nPut your hands up people, it's time to fight now\nI beat holes in your chest, remain hostile\nThreaten my life? (C'mon!) One day you'll understand\nThey say that pride is the sign of a foolish man\nSo who the fuck you think you talking to\nLive and direct in the flesh, I'm right in front of you\n\n[Chorus: Nate Dogg]\nI love it when you niggas be talking, saying my name\nSeems like your mouth is not connected to your brain\nTwo-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same\nBetter have a strap my nigga, simple and plain\nPut your nuts on the table, my nigga let's play the game\nHurt you so long, you'll be a-ddicted to pain\nI don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain\nRight before you lay in your coffin, ho, say my name\n\n[Verse 4: Eminem]\nI never really smashed on Jermaine's ass, Dre smashed him\nNobody ganged up 'til he came back and jacked him\nI never really brought it to his ass, I tapped him\nI could have been like Treach, boom-bapped and slapped him\nPurple, for mimicking him with two rapping Urkels\nI could have snapped, took it past rap and hurt you\nBut I didn't, I kept it on wax and served you\nI Square Dance cause I'm sick of rapping circles\nAround these clowns, steady trying to call me out\nIt's like I'm listening to motherfucking dogs meow\nYou'd probably do better trying to come and stomp me out\nYou don't want it with rap, this is what I'm all about, c'mon\n(I) No gangsta you ain't either\n(Will) But I know that I spit ether\n(Not) I shit across your belly\n(Lose) Show you I'm not R. Kelly\n(X) Pass me the weed, I'mma put my ashes out on his ass\nFor the last time, man (Watch your fucking mouth)\n\n[Chorus: Nate Dogg]\nI love it when you niggas be talking, saying my name\nSeems like your mouth is not connected to your brain\nTwo-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same\nBetter have a strap my nigga, simple and plain\nPut your nuts on the table, my nigga let's play the game\nHurt you so long, you'll be a-ddicted to pain\nI don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain\nRight before you lay in your coffin, ho, say my name\n\n[Outro: Eminem]\nFor the last time, man, I'm through"}}, {"title": "Paparazzi", "album": "At the Speed of Life", "year": null, "lyrics": "[Intro]\nYes, 1996 marks the beginning of a new era\nThe dysfunctional member of the Alkaholiks family\nIt\u2019s Xzibit!\n\n[Verse 1]\nSometimes I wonder if it\u2019s all worth my while\nXzibit stay versatile, with million dollar lifestyle\nAnd I could feel it as a child growing up\nThe niggas that was real\nAnd the niggas that was scared as fuck\nThat's why Xzibit only roll with a chosen few\nYou ain't really real, I can tell when I look at you\nSo ease off the trigger-talk, you ain\u2019t killin' shit\nIt\u2019s not affecting me or the niggas that I'm chillin' with\nI don\u2019t believe the hype or buy wolf tickets\nNigga, you make a gang of noise and never seen, like a cricket\nI guess that\u2019s why we never kick it\nA lot of niggas is soft and get tossed tryna fuck with the Likwit\nHow many niggas do you know like this?\nAlways claimin' that they ridin' but they really turned bitch\nIt don\u2019t make sense, either you\u2019re a soldier from the start\nOr an actor with a record deal tryna play the part\u2014like that!\n\n[Chorus]\nIt\u2019s a shame, niggas in the rap game\nOnly for the money and the fame (Extra large!)\nIt\u2019s a shame, niggas in the rap game\nOnly for the money and the fame (Paparazzi!)\n\n[Verse 2]\nSee, I don\u2019t need no lights, no cameras; just action, goddamn it\nNever no superstar, I'm more like a planet\nSo my composure is kept while others start to sweat\nEmergin' from the fog with my fucked-up dialogue\nTryna live high on the hog leaves you bankrupt\nAnd niggas you spent it on would not give a fuck\nAnd that\u2019s deep; how deep?

"[Intro]\nYes, 1996 marks the beginning of a new era\nThe dysfunctional member of the Alkaholiks family\nIt\u2019s Xzibit!\n\n[Verse 1]\nSometimes I wonder if it\u2019s all worth my while\nXzibit stay versatile, with million dollar lifestyle\nAnd I could feel it as a child growing up\nThe niggas that was real\nAnd the niggas that was scared as fuck\nThat's why Xzibit only roll with a chosen few\nYou ain't really real, I can tell when I look at you\nSo ease off the trigger-talk, you ain\u2019t killin' shit\nIt\u2019s not affecting me or the niggas that I'm chillin' with\nI don\u2019t believe the hype or buy wolf tickets\nNigga, you make a gang of noise and never seen, like a cricket\nI guess that\u2019s why we never kick it\nA lot of niggas is soft and get tossed tryna fuck with the Likwit\nHow many niggas do you know like this?\nAlways claimin' that they ridin' but they really turned bitch\nIt don\u2019t make sense, either you\u2019re a soldier from the start\nOr an actor with a record deal tryna play the part\u2014like that!\n\n[Chorus]\nIt\u2019s a shame, niggas in the rap game\nOnly for the money and the fame (Extra large!)\nIt\u2019s a shame, niggas in the rap game\nOnly for the money and the fame (Paparazzi!)\n\n[Verse 2]\nSee, I don\u2019t need no lights, no cameras; just action, goddamn it\nNever no superstar, I'm more like a planet\nSo my composure is kept while others start to sweat\nEmergin' from the fog with my fucked-up dialogue\nTryna live high on the hog leaves you bankrupt\nAnd niggas you spent it on would not give a fuck\nAnd that\u2019s deep; how deep? It\u2019s deeper than Atlantis\nHome of the scandalous: big bad Los Angeles\nDangerous, vandalous, yo, not to be trusted\nNow, how the fuck is you hard\nNot being scared by the boulevard?\nI'm pullin' that card, and saying \"Gin, mothafucka!\"\nFlowin' like liquid; soak it in, mothafucka!\nI'm breakin' it down, my sound surrounds like death\nFrom the West, puttin' whole counties to the test\nIt\u2019s all in perspective, breaker 1-9 copy\nThis is for the niggas gettin' caught up in the paparazzi\n\n[Chorus]\nIt\u2019s a shame, niggas in the rap game\nOnly for the money and the fame (Extra large!)\nIt\u2019s a shame, niggas in the rap game\nOnly for the money and the fame (Paparazzi!)\n\n[Verse 3]\nNiggas smoke stress and crossdress, but I just play the back\nOthers going through schemes and pipe dreams for a contract\nReal tightly rolled, fuck \u2019em all how I feel\nI made a cool half mill' before I had a record deal\nTherefore you look and stare like it\u2019s magic\nBut too much of anything can make you an addict\nWhenever devils be startin' static, break out the automatic\nI set it off straight, I spread hate, then I vacate\nBut wait! Who dares to cross this path?\nYo, I do you like math, cut with glass, make a bloodbath\nSo on behalf of all niggas I get drunk with\nSmokin' blunts with, I dispose of your punk shit\nHe-he, and keep it all in perspective\nCarbon copies gettin' caught up in the paparazzi\nOnce again, it's the Likwidation crew\nAnd we return at you like this\n\n[Chorus]\nIt\u2019s a shame, niggas in the rap game\nOnly for the money and the fame (Extra large!)\nIt\u2019s a shame, niggas in the rap game\nOnly for the money and the fame (Paparazzi!)"}}, {"title": "X", "album": "Restless", "year": "2000-11-28", "lyrics": "[Intro: Xzibit]\nYeah!

underground, we under water drinking liquid by the gallons\n\n[Tash]\nSlurred words, double vision, brain busting, head rushing\nSince I'm too drunk to walk, I rock a party on crutches\nAnd still rush the roughest MC who wanna get it\nForget it, it's Likwit, Tha Liks and, Xzibit\nCa-Tash on the blast the final piece to the puzzle\nI slap bitches on the ass I slap tits up out the muzzle\nI shuffle with the microphone, bang rhymes consistent\nYou wack and I'm Ca-Tash and that's the motherfucking difference\nFor instance, \"21 and Over\" set your clocks back (Tick tock tick tock)\nStill standing where the rocks at\nTwo-thousand-one, we still young guns that's Restless\n(Thirty niggas, sixty hoes) and that's the motherfucking guest list!\n\n[Hook: Xzibit]\nCall it what you wanna call it\nI'm a

please be selective\nThis is California can't stick your dick in everything\nWe will survive necessarily by any means\nLet no man ever hold you down or supress you\nIt's the 90's the police just arrest you\nDisrespect you on occasion take life\nBy the time you come of age they'll probably blast on sight\nIt's a shame they protect them but try to serve us\nWhen your neck is on the line stand ground then bust\nIn God we trust but just incase keep it loaded and locked\nReady to rock then shake the spot, the Foundation\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou came from a long line of killers and drug dealers\nWho forever smoke bud\nSo it's probably in your blood\nRealize you can only run the streets so long\nThen the streets run you into the ground then gone\nIt's kinda ruff trying to teach you what's right from wrong\nSame shit different day\nIt's the same ol' song\nIf the time ever comes that I meet my match\nTake control of my assets\nFuck startin' from scratch\nTake care of your mother, keep yourself on track\nJust cause niggas get behind you don't mean they got your back\nBeware of the serpent\nCause there's a time in life the mothafucker will strike\nAnd try to make you loose sight\nDon't be a fake mothafucker tryin' to keep shit real\nFill cassettes with idle threats with no guts to kill\nSon if you ever pull heat then use it\nIf you got a chance to walk away then do it\nTotal domination takes full concentration in all situations\nA solid foundation(yeah yeah)\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou are the foundation\nBeginning of a new generation\nI remember hospital hallway, pacin'\nI was anxious as fuck to see your face shine\nOnly to find that yours looked like mine\nSo it's like I'm livin' twice at the exact same time\nIn this life you can't press stop\nThen press rewind\nGotta live to the fullest never follow behind no man\nHave your own plan, expand your mind( expand your mind)\nAin't no paper thin game to raise wannabe thugs\nThis is nothing but love\nVia sattelite Muggs\nTake heed when it's your turn to bring new life\nMake sure it's the woman you gonna make your wife\nBe prepared for the worst, but expect the best\nNo matter where life takes you\nCome home to the West\nSurvival takes more than just gats and guns\nThat's words to live by\nFrom a father to a son\nFoundation", "image": "https://images.genius.com/341f402fe708e50eb8d8c5c6542af9d9.600x521x1.jpg",

bone\nYou's a breath of fresh air in this world of shit\nYou was born to be a soldier don't ever forget\nHit back when hit\nUse force that's effective\nAll these bitches and women\nSon, please be selective\nThis is California can't stick your dick in everything\nWe will survive necessarily by any means\nLet no man ever hold you down or supress you\nIt's the 90's the police just arrest you\nDisrespect you on occasion take life\nBy the time you come of age they'll probably blast on sight\nIt's a shame they protect them but try to serve us\nWhen your neck is on the line stand ground then bust\nIn God we trust but just incase keep it loaded and locked\nReady to rock then shake the spot, the Foundation\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou came from a long line of killers and drug dealers\nWho forever smoke bud\nSo it's probably in your blood\nRealize you can only run the streets so long\nThen the streets run you into the ground then gone\nIt's kinda ruff trying to teach you what's right from wrong\nSame shit different day\nIt's the same ol' song\nIf the time ever comes that I meet my match\nTake control of my assets\nFuck startin' from scratch\nTake care of your mother, keep yourself on track\nJust cause niggas get behind you don't mean they got your back\nBeware of the serpent\nCause there's a time in life the mothafucker will strike\nAnd try to make you loose sight\nDon't be a fake mothafucker tryin' to keep shit real\nFill cassettes with idle threats with no guts to kill\nSon if you ever pull heat then use it\nIf you got a chance to walk away then do it\nTotal domination takes full concentration in all situations\nA solid foundation(yeah yeah)\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou are the foundation\nBeginning of a new generation\nI remember hospital hallway, pacin'\nI was anxious as fuck to see your face shine\nOnly to find that yours looked like mine\nSo it's like I'm livin' twice at the exact same time\nIn this life you can't press stop\nThen press rewind\nGotta live to the fullest never follow behind no man\nHave your own plan, expand your mind( expand your mind)\nAin't no paper thin game to raise wannabe thugs\nThis is nothing but love\nVia sattelite Muggs\nTake heed when it's your turn to bring new life\nMake sure it's the woman you gonna make your wife\nBe prepared for the worst, but expect the best\nNo matter where life takes you\nCome home to the West\nSurvival takes more than just gats and guns\nThat's words to live by\nFrom a father to a son\nFoundation"}}, {"title": "Multiply", "album": "Man vs Machine", "year": null, "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Xzibit]\nI've beeeeen

planet until I'm convalescent\nI never count my blessings, I only count the cost of living\nIt's hard to buy everything they sell on television\nMy momma cried religion, I only got my dreams\nOne day

never fall, after all\nMy pride is all I got, respect is all I want\nAnd I will never crawl, this a race, so I run\nFar from where I begun, look at the man that I've become\nLook up in the sky, as long as the sun rise\nI'll be on this rhyme, while you waiting for the signs\nYou mistaken, if you think you takin' what's mine\nIn a world where the blind lead the blind, I'll be fine\nJust like the world keep spinning, I'ma keep winning\nEither you rollin' with it or you choose to go against it\nYour thoughts are so offensive, so I expose intentions\nMy offence against opposition is so impressive\nSo here's a message to all of my competition\nMy words in this composition, reflects the way I'm livin'\nExpecting something different when doing the same thing\nIs the true definition of

that sometimes\nIt's so simple, simple, as one, two, three\nBack on your feet, you gotta hold your head high\nLet 'em know we right here, forever\nWe ain't going nowhere till the end of the world\n\n[Verse 1: Xzibit]\nLadies and gentleman, introducing the most impressive\nI plan on shaking the planet until I'm convalescent\nI never count my blessings, I only count the cost of living\nIt's hard to buy everything they sell on television\nMy momma cried religion, I only got my dreams\nOne day they gonna be reality, can't rip off the seam\nIf I could just achieve, and not just make-believe\nBut anybody else is gon' create what only I can see\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Young De]\nStanding tall, never fall, after all\nMy pride is all I got, respect is all I want\nAnd I will never crawl, this a race, so I run\nFar from where I begun, look at the man that I've become\nLook up in the sky, as long as the sun rise\nI'll be on this rhyme, while you waiting for the signs\nYou mistaken, if you think you takin' what's mine\nIn a world where the blind lead the blind, I'll be fine\nJust like the world keep spinning, I'ma keep winning\nEither you rollin' with it or you choose to go against it\nYour thoughts are so offensive, so I expose intentions\nMy offence against opposition is so impressive\nSo here's a message to all of my competition\nMy words in this composition, reflects the way I'm livin'\nExpecting something different when doing the same thing\nIs the true definition of insane\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Xzibit]\nLet them know we right here forever, we ain't going nowhere till the end of the world"}}, {"title": "Napalm", "album": "Napalm", "year": "2012-10-05", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYeah, you thought that this was over\nThought you got away with murder\nWatch me murder my deserters\nThis is congress secret service\nGot your epirdermis calling\nFrom the toxins in the water\nUse the oxygen to slaughter\nThis is big business, baby, blood money bringing benefits\nStill suffer from the ideology of Willie Lynch\nNow it's all making sense, lets breed ignorance\nCause ignorance is bliss, watch the bliss make us filthy rich, bitch\n\n[Hook]\nI'm okay now, bring the napalm\nI'll fly over and blow you away\nNo more sunshine, no more playgrounds\nI'll fly over and blow you away now\nThere's no glamour, no guts, no glory\nWhen I fly over, and blow you away\nBlow you away now\nThe fuck can you say now?\nI'm loading my napalm\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe last shall be first, got dammit planet here we go\nCamouflage cowboy, saddle up; rodeo\nHIV, Polio, positive identity\nAshes of evil because we can't believe the trinity\nHomeland Security, false is superiority\nFuck your intentions and big plans for my community\nI ain't afraid to die, fuck you gon' do with that?\nI'm coming to find you and wipe you off the fucking map, brrat\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI just wanted to live my life like the common man\nHave a family, a picket fence with a couple friends\nMaybe even walk the dog when the night is right\nSuch a pretty picture, we dancing under flashing lights\nAnd we wouldn't have a worry, not in the world at all\nWatch my favorite sitcom and go outside and mow the lawn\nI come inside just in time to see our baby walking\nAnd bringing flowers ain't special because I do it often\nI'll be working a 9 to 5 'till I'm old and grey\nThen just wither away the dust, watch it float away\nAnd it'll be complete my life because I lived it right\nNever lifted my voice in anger just to pacify\nI guess it's all eventual how all these chips should fall\nHow can you appreciate walking if you have never crawled?\nMatter of fact, why am I talking, I should be standing tall\nInstead I'm in a world full of shit steaming, screaming fuck 'em all\nAerosol arsonist, tagging up the Apocalypse\nThe narcoleptic masses so I bang completely opposite\nAll you need is confidence, I don't need no compliments\nThe system sets the standards, destruction of the obvious\nThis is for the populous, population genocide\nPatriotic duty look alive but never sympathize\nTake 'em by surprise, strike 'em early when they rise\nWhen they open up they eyes, but they still so fucking blind\nBut hey, hey\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro]\nSerial killer", "image": "https://images.genius.com/727e047579481405310e18c83d10416c.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Xzibit",

away\nBlow you away now\nThe fuck can you say now?\nI'm loading my napalm\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe last shall be first, got dammit planet here we go\nCamouflage cowboy, saddle up; rodeo\nHIV, Polio, positive identity\nAshes of evil because we can't believe the trinity\nHomeland Security, false is superiority\nFuck your intentions and big plans for my community\nI ain't afraid to die, fuck you gon' do with that?\nI'm coming to find you and wipe you off the fucking map, brrat\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI just wanted to live my life like the common man\nHave a family, a picket fence with a couple friends\nMaybe even walk the dog when the night is right\nSuch a pretty picture, we dancing under flashing lights\nAnd we wouldn't have a worry, not in the world at all\nWatch my favorite sitcom and go outside and mow the lawn\nI come inside just in time to see our baby walking\nAnd bringing flowers ain't special because I do it often\nI'll be working a 9 to 5 'till I'm old and grey\nThen just wither away the dust, watch it float away\nAnd it'll be complete my life because I lived it right\nNever lifted my voice in anger just to pacify\nI guess it's all eventual how all these chips should fall\nHow can you appreciate walking if you have never crawled?\nMatter of fact, why am I talking, I should be standing tall\nInstead I'm in a world full of shit steaming, screaming fuck 'em all\nAerosol arsonist, tagging up the Apocalypse\nThe narcoleptic masses so I bang completely opposite\nAll you need is confidence, I don't need no compliments\nThe system sets the standards, destruction of the obvious\nThis is for the populous, population genocide\nPatriotic duty look alive but never sympathize\nTake 'em by surprise, strike 'em early when they rise\nWhen they open up they eyes, but they still so fucking blind\nBut hey, hey\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro]\nSerial killer"}}, {"title": "Spit Shine", "album": "8 Mile: Music from and Inspired by the Motion Picture", "year":

knives, straight with razors\nGood with grenades, great with gauges\nBeen around the world on a million stages\nWatch niggas bitch up and go through changes\nI had guns before thugs was in fashion\nI mashed out before niggas knew mashing\nI knew terror before the plane started crashing\nI got punch lines and niggas ain't laughing\n\n[Hook]\nI'm gon be here after the smoke die down\nInsomnia style,

shit's mine\nEvery time I spit I shine\n\n[Verse 2]\nCocksucker, I preach what I practice, back shit up\nWrap this rap shit up, still acting up\nGet found in a trunk of an Acura\nY'all suck like jail

the way we would have wanted it to come out\nUmm, let's face it, this is real life\nAnd this is the thought that was captured from me\nThat words only share a small portion of the vision that they give witness too\n\n[Verse 1]\n\nI had to write this in blood, because the ink wouldn't stick\nI sold five to six million but, yo, that ain\u2019t really shit\nIt was supposed to be different, we were supposed to ride out,\u00a0\nBut too much shot his girl, then shot himself in the mouth\nThen the steady game form but very soon fell apart,\u00a0\n\u2018cause when you just doing all, with no the loyalty in your heart,\u00a0\nIt\u2019s like catching Alzheimers on all these niggers forgetting where they\u2019re coming from\nAnd they\u2019re slowing down, wait a minute, what we\u2019re running from?\nThis what we\u2019re supposed to do, here\u2019s where we\u2019re supposed to be,\u00a0\nI hated MTV for trying to play me like a mockery\nBut that don't bother me, I just fulfill my fucking contract\nSmall price to pay just to take a piece of my back\nMy back, backfire, assassination of my character\nJust to make some millions off of America\nMy younger sister, Erika, just adopted a child,\u00a0\nMy older brother served fifteen, he made it out\nEven though my father loved me, I ain\u2019t seen him in a while\nHad to fight my baby momma, bitch, give me my nigga now\n\u2018cause he's running out of time and I need him to understand\nThe way a superior man had build a brand\nNiggas talk about my taxes, had to pay to Uncle Sam\nI\u2019m surviving cause the mind\u2019s eyes quicker than the hand\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nHeartbreak, disappointment, my mother died when I was nine\nI just wanted to join her\nNah Mr. Joiner, you get to California, I got something for you to do, it was like I was anointed\nResurrected, found my purpose\nI remember meeting Dre, being nervous when I would kick my verses\nI was virtually worthless, my whole life was a circus\nI was sleeping with serpents and I thought it is worth it\nGot a call from Paul, told me shit isn\u2019t working\nExchange words, told me tell me that shit in person\nHe probably told Em, and by the way did he said it unapologetic twisted made about him\nI see Slim and he said he didn\u2019t recognize me\nWas it that or did he let another man define me\nI don\u2019t know, but now I gotta get this all behind me\nFollow my calling when I used to follow niggers blindly\n\n[Verse 3]\n\nI wish I had a better relationship with my uncles\nBlood relatives I could turn to when I\u2019m feeling trouble\nAnd talk about my struggles\nMy uncle John Nail, he only put me on the phone with different females\nAnd this is such a such, nephew, tell 'er, what\u2019s up?\nAin\u2019t even ask about Tremayne and Gatlyn , growing up\nFuck, I drink it all and I smash the bottle\nSelf medicated numb, but I'mma feel it tomorrow\nIt feel like pain and sorrow was like a second skin\nBut now the pain is gone I got my second win\nOnly the strong live long, you better settle in\nI\u2019m fighting for ever, I will never let the devil win\n1983, that\u2019s when my journey begins\nI searched every world for strength, only to find it within\nThis for me and my kin, still dying to live\nLiving life to the fullest 'till I see you again", "image": "https://images.genius.com/727e047579481405310e18c83d10416c.1000x1000x1.jpg",

Buddhist to a Christian\nTell 'em Catholic Ronnie been it\nSippin' red wine inside the Pentagon\nWritin sinister lines 'til all the ink inside my pen is gone\nJeremy Lin got the world watchin' ESPN\nMy sick porno obsession's got me watchin' these lesbians\nI'm a sick fuckin' psychotic bastard\nThe mic is my sword, the booth is your casket\nI'm sittin' inside a classic six-four with the ratchet\nThrowin' up west side is my worst fuckin' habit\nAll these snap backs and egos\nEyes lookin' through peep holes is why I don't trust no one except God and Tim Tebow\nI'm livin' my destiny, poppin' pills, high as fuck\nFuckin' bitches in the club, holdin' my Spades bottle up\nI think it's time you salute me or shoot me\nEither way, I'm the star of this motherfuckin' movie\n\n[Verse 2: Slim The Mobster]\nThey say I got a suicidal tendency murderin' all my enemies first\nIt ain't no question, the thunder under my shirt\nFuck around and you'll be up under the dirt\nThis automatic'll turn your Hummer to a hearse\nWorse case scenario, pipe bomb your burial\nThey gonna have to bury you twice\nThis scary cat on this night life\nThe Gulf stream private but the weed is top flight\nMy PO already know I'm a motherfuckin' flight risk\nHeavy chain, light wrist, pay cash for everything\nThat white bitch (she got it, she got it) that's my words to Orenthal\nSixteen and a two liter got it lookin' like motor oil\nI'm leanin' hard in that flat black turbo charged coupe on twenty-fours, pedal to the floor\nOne hunnid shots at a nigga, still got plenty more\nSlim The Mobster and my Israeli-made Uzi\nWe turn your block to a motherfuckin' movie\n\n[Chorus: Young De]\nLights, cameras, action, niggas ready to shoot (shoot)\nBut these ain't lights and cameras pointed at you (you)\nBlock off the scene 'cause your scenes don't move me\nWe'll turn your block into a motherfuckin' movie\nLights, cameras, action, niggas ready to shoot (shoot)\nBut these ain't lights and cameras pointed at you (you)\nBlock off the scene 'cause your scenes don't move me\nWe'll turn your block into a motherfuckin' movie\n\n[Verse 3: Xzibit]\nBack When We Were Kings, we were the Lord of the Rings\nRequiem for a Dream, smokin' my Soylent Green\nNow I know why the Cage Bird sings, there's no more Men of Honor\nI'm Iron Man in my suit of armor, runnin' from karma\nThe Good Die Young, No Country for Old Men\nThere Will be Blood deeper than Leviathan\nAnd my Platoon full of Bad Lieutenants\nX-Men, Expendables, Bad Company criminals\nCrush Grooves with a Kangol, Serpent And The Rainbow\n48 Hours to Kill Bill, Cash and Tango\nBraveheart, Battleship, Devil's Advocate with the Passion of Christ, It's A Wonderful Life\nMiami Vice, what to get right\nIt's Midnight in the Garden the Good and Evil\nI Crash Ordinary People, Lethal Weapon without four sequels\nSurvive the Hunger Games\nThe Gods Must be Crazy, Ricochet through the Purple Rain\nBecause The Devil Wears Prada\nThe Dead Presidents can turn a Goodfella to a Godfather\nAnimal House, Stand and Deliver The King's Speech\nLeonardo DiCaprio on the beach\nOcean's Eleven if All Dogs go to Heaven\nThe Silence of the Lambs, Son of Sam, Seven, I am Legend\nFuck this New Jack City, I'm on the Midnight Express\nWith this American History X, yes\n\n[Verse 4: Crooked I]\nOff the dome and I'm talkin' slick as petroleum\n'Cause I don't fuck with pens 'less I'm ballin' on some linoleum\nNiggas preachin' hate from Napoleon\nI'm slowly throwing salt in my game like pourin' some sodium on a goalie\nBut, homie, I'm only in it for the cash sport\nThink you fucked the world? Somethin' like a pornstar with a passport\nWith Officer Walker and my side mirror in\nHe don't like me 'cause I'm dark as a Nigerian\nRockin' a lot of jewelry and smart as a librarian\nAnd the look in my errogant eyes said I'd bury him\nI said it before, don't ignore it again\nTwo hands on the Nine, like a quarter to ten, dude\nLife's a hooker, the hall raised me\nThis poor baby was born crazy\nPut in the middle of drug wars, thug lords and judges tryna to court case me\nLord, Save Me, it's Scorsese, a movie\n\n[Chorus: Young De]\nLights, cameras, action, niggas ready to shoot (shoot)\nBut these ain't lights and cameras pointed at you (you)\nBlock off the scene 'cause your scenes don't move me\nWe'll turn your block into a motherfuckin' movie\nLights, cameras, action, niggas ready to shoot (shoot)\nBut these ain't lights and cameras pointed at you (you)\nBlock off the scene 'cause your scenes don't move me\nWe'll turn your block into a motherfuckin' movie"}}, {"title": "At the Speed of Life", "album": "At the Speed of Life", "year": "1996-10-15", "lyrics": "[Intro: Dialogue from Taxi Driver]\nListen you fuckers, you screwheads\nHere's a man who would not take it anymore\nA man who stood up against\nThe scum, the cunts, the dogs, the filth, the shit\nHere is some one who stood up\nHere is...\nYeah! Hennessy for Everyone Music proudly presents\nXzibit, movin' at the speed of life\nYeah! Check it\n\n[Verse 1]\nIt took a long time comin but we waited\nXzibit went from underrated, to now most anticipated\nNever would of thought that I would rock your set\nAnd get love and respect without no special effects\nOnly the rugged ruff shit that the hard rock need\nLyrics must contain more then just clothes bitches and weed\nThinkin how you like to see the next man bleed\nTryin to glorify greed; livin life at ridiculous speed - indeed!\nThe main goal's to achieve, to succeed\nHave it laid out for your seed\nBut the world gets colder every day by day\nPhysically, mentally gettin drained by L.A\nTrying to find piece of mind is like tryin to find a gold mine\nIt just won't happen, no time for relaxin\nReal soldiers of fortune the front line of the action\nSo never show a nigga what you packin (You know what I'm sayin?)\nIt's too much weight to be jugglin\nWho do you picture when you think about strugglin\nKids in the bed, no food stomach bubbilin\nOr niggas in the E-class heavy drug smugglin\n\n[Chorus]\nMovin'', yeah!\nYes, movin'\nAt the speed of life\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd plus I feel that no style is darker than mine\nThere was a time it was all about beats and rhymes\nBut nowadays the blind just follow the blind\nAnd when I die, niggas still recite these lines\nTo rock the heads, waterbeds citys and towns\nBringin strength to the masses that be holdin it down\nThe underground! to upper echelon and beyond\nXzibit rock and roll the streets like a vagabond\nNigga wanna trip you gettin dissed like a blonde bitch\nMackin to Farrakhan, run game like a marathon\nIt's here today then tomorrow it's gone\nIt's the law of the land, a straight modern day babylon!\n\n[Chorus]\nMovin', yeah!

Bring it live, yeah!\n\n[Verse 3]\nXzibit lookin at the earth thru wide angles\nI find a stairway to heaven in the city of lost angels\nWhere small situations turn to heavy altercations\nWith a heavy-ass price cause, niggas don't fight no more!\nBefore hip-hop was all about drama\nAnything for a dollar before Kane fucked Madonna\nXzibit maintain and stayed bent like a comma\nJust me and my bottle, we shall lead not follow\nEmcees be full of shit but they style be hollow\nIt seems you've bitten off more than you can possibly swallow\nJust a day in the life of a man named X\nOnly blunts and latex for the opposite sex\nYou see niggas comin through to smoke out and pay respect\nEver since fifteen, I been ready for anything\nWhatever they bring in any shape form or fashion\nI live to the fullest and rock rhyme with a passion\nBut in the meanwhile if worse comes to worst\nBust a round or bust a verse whatever comes first\nYeah! we got it locked down tight\nXzibit bring truth to the

against\nThe scum, the cunts, the dogs, the filth, the shit\nHere is some one who stood up\nHere is...\nYeah! Hennessy for Everyone Music proudly presents\nXzibit, movin' at the speed of life\nYeah! Check it\n\n[Verse 1]\nIt took a long time comin but we waited\nXzibit went from underrated, to now most anticipated\nNever would of thought that I would rock your set\nAnd get love and respect without no special effects\nOnly the rugged ruff shit that the hard rock need\nLyrics must contain more then just clothes bitches and weed\nThinkin how you like to see the next man bleed\nTryin to glorify greed; livin life at ridiculous speed - indeed!\nThe main goal's to achieve, to succeed\nHave it laid out for your seed\nBut the world gets colder every day by day\nPhysically, mentally gettin drained by L.A\nTrying to find piece of mind is like tryin to find a gold mine\nIt just won't happen, no time for relaxin\nReal soldiers of fortune the front line of the action\nSo never show a nigga what you packin (You know what I'm sayin?)\nIt's too much weight to be jugglin\nWho do you picture when you think about strugglin\nKids in the bed, no food stomach bubbilin\nOr niggas in the E-class heavy drug smugglin\n\n[Chorus]\nMovin'', yeah!\nYes, movin'\nAt the speed of life\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd plus I feel that no style is darker than mine\nThere was a time it was all about beats and rhymes\nBut nowadays the blind just follow the blind\nAnd when I die, niggas still recite these lines\nTo rock the heads, waterbeds citys and towns\nBringin strength to the masses that be holdin it down\nThe underground! to upper echelon and beyond\nXzibit rock and roll the streets like a vagabond\nNigga wanna trip you gettin dissed like a blonde bitch\nMackin to Farrakhan, run game like a marathon\nIt's here today then tomorrow it's gone\nIt's the law of the land, a straight modern day babylon!\n\n[Chorus]\nMovin', yeah! Yeah! Like this\nLike this, at the speed of life\nAh! Bring it live, yeah!\n\n[Verse 3]\nXzibit lookin at the earth thru wide angles\nI find a stairway to heaven in the city of lost angels\nWhere small situations turn to heavy altercations\nWith a heavy-ass price cause, niggas don't fight no more!\nBefore hip-hop was all about drama\nAnything for a dollar before Kane fucked Madonna\nXzibit maintain and stayed bent like a comma\nJust me and my bottle, we shall lead not follow\nEmcees be full of shit but they style be hollow\nIt seems you've bitten off more than you can possibly swallow\nJust a day in the life of a man named X\nOnly blunts and latex for the opposite sex\nYou see niggas comin through to smoke out and pay respect\nEver since fifteen, I been ready for anything\nWhatever they bring in any shape form or fashion\nI live to the fullest and rock rhyme with a passion\nBut in the meanwhile if worse comes to worst\nBust a round or bust a verse whatever comes first\nYeah! we got it locked down tight\nXzibit bring truth to the light shit is movin, at the speed of life\n\n[Chorus]\nMovin'\nAt the speed of life"}}, {"title": "What U See is What U Get", "album": "40 Days & 40 Nightz", "year": "1998-07-06", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nAnd so it was written, and after all these things\nI saw another angel come down from heaven\nHaving great power, and the earth was lightened with his glory\nAnd he cried mightily with a strong voice saying\n\"Babylon the great has fallen\nHas fallen and has become the habitation of devils\nAnd the home to every foul spirit\nAnd a cage of very unclean, and hateful men\"\n\n[Verse 1]\nYeah, what you see is what you get now\nXzibit never wait around for no kickdown, got my own shit loud\nShot heard around the world\nUplift, bench press, arm curl, keep the structure of the temple\nTo make things simple, my existence is a ripple through time\nOnly concerned with what is mine, divine\nNever monkeyshine, walkin down a very thin line\nHoldin heat, runnin crazy in the streets, yeah (What's up?)\nPlus the company I keep put in overtime while you oversleep\nDon't wanna see none of this evil I speak\nAround the atlas, cume la matra, the super actress\nYou all get close-lined and pinned to the mattress\nAll day, every day, every which way\nWho said you can't have your cake and eat it too (Fuck you!)\nThis is hard time on Planet Earth, for what it's worth\nXzibit stay in rotation without rehabilitation like this\n\n[Bridge]\nPlayers, pimps, hoes, hustlers\nWillies, thugs, ballers, busters\nGangstas, macks, everyday, all day\nShot callers, even high rollers keep it moving\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat you see is what you get now\nThe kinda style make the whole world go wild\nBless the child that can hold his own, flesh and bone\nAnd no matter where I roam I feel right at home, and that's the real shit\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou got more than you bargained for; hit the floor\nI pull a fast one to let you know today could be your last one black\nTake your breath like an asthma attack\nJust a slave like Flavor Flav, \"You're blind to the facts\"\nMr. X to the Z, tha Liks and King Tee\nGuaranteed to bring the house down naturally\nNiggas knowin No Limits like Master P\nMakin you motherfuckin bastards see (What?)\nA whole different breed of MC; realize it's you against me\nCatch a three-hundred and sixty degree\nRoundhouse to the mouth right\nAnd like the sun, make the hot shit shine bright\nI feelin like my whole life is a green light never turn red\nCause I strike like a rattlesnake, lock like a dread\nNiggas wanna bump heads, but they better off dead\nCame crashin through the door like the Feds, bring it\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat you see is what you get now\nThe kinda style make the whole world go wild\nBless the child that can hold his own, flesh and bone\nAnd no matter where I roam I feel right at home, and that's the real shit\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe year everybody start to rush\nSwingin through is your friendly neighborhood lush\nI crack your bottle then watch how Xzibit bust\nI regulate like a killer with a nickel plate, I set it straight\nStart to shakin you down, breakin new ground, construction work\nHeavy artillery, put your dick in the dirt\nStay alert, the game is rough so you might get hurt\nSlug burnt through your jacket through your sweater, through your shirt\nGet cut from the belly up (What?)\nI break the chain, fast lane, suck my sugar cane\nI'm tryin to spark a nigga brain while you entertain trivial things\nMaterial things, protected by the underground kings\nWho rule the land with an iron fist\nThe Men in Black, if we flash can't remember shit (Sorry)\nYou cross me, I'll make you pay like the government, I wanna kill Sam\nCause my package came short twelve grams, get the picture?\n\n[Bridge]\nPlayers, pimps, hoes, hustlers\nWillies, thugs, ballers, busters\nGangstas, macks, everyday, all day\nShot callers, even high rollers keep it moving\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat you see is what you get now\nThe kinda style make the whole world go wild\nBless the child that can hold his own, flesh and bone\nAnd no matter where I roam I feel right at home, and that's the real shit", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a7eeb6d0d151d5abb0da7deca4672f96.600x602x1.jpg", "artist": "Xzibit", "raw": {"annotation_count": 22, "api_path": "/songs/48143", "apple_music_id": "268549907", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/48143/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "\u201cWhat U See Is What U Get\u201d is the first single from Xzibit\u2019s second album, 40 Dayz & 40 Nightz.

heaven\nHaving great power, and the earth was lightened with his glory\nAnd he cried mightily with a strong voice saying\n\"Babylon the great has fallen\nHas fallen and has become the habitation of devils\nAnd the home to every foul spirit\nAnd a cage of very unclean, and hateful men\"\n\n[Verse 1]\nYeah, what you see is what you get now\nXzibit never wait around for no kickdown, got my own shit loud\nShot heard around the world\nUplift, bench press, arm curl, keep the structure of the temple\nTo make things simple, my existence is a ripple through time\nOnly concerned with what is mine, divine\nNever monkeyshine, walkin down a very thin line\nHoldin heat, runnin crazy in the streets, yeah (What's up?)\nPlus the company I keep put in overtime while you oversleep\nDon't wanna see none of this evil I speak\nAround the atlas, cume la matra, the super actress\nYou all get close-lined and pinned to the mattress\nAll day, every day, every which way\nWho said you can't have your cake and eat it too (Fuck you!)\nThis is hard time on Planet Earth, for what it's worth\nXzibit stay in rotation without rehabilitation like this\n\n[Bridge]\nPlayers, pimps, hoes, hustlers\nWillies, thugs, ballers, busters\nGangstas, macks, everyday, all day\nShot callers, even high rollers keep it moving\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat you see is what you get now\nThe kinda style make the whole world go wild\nBless the child that can hold his own, flesh and bone\nAnd no matter where I roam I feel right at home, and that's the real shit\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou got more than you bargained for; hit the floor\nI pull a fast one to let you know today could be your last one black\nTake your breath like an asthma attack\nJust a slave like Flavor Flav, \"You're blind to the facts\"\nMr. X to the Z, tha Liks and King Tee\nGuaranteed to bring the house down naturally\nNiggas knowin No Limits like Master P\nMakin you motherfuckin bastards see (What?)\nA whole different breed of MC; realize it's you against me\nCatch a three-hundred and sixty degree\nRoundhouse to the mouth right\nAnd like the sun, make the hot shit shine bright\nI feelin like my whole life is a green light never turn red\nCause I strike like a rattlesnake, lock like a dread\nNiggas wanna bump heads, but they better off dead\nCame crashin through the door like the Feds, bring it\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat you see is what you get now\nThe kinda style make the whole world go wild\nBless the child that can hold his own, flesh and bone\nAnd no matter where I roam I feel right at home, and that's the real shit\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe year everybody start to rush\nSwingin through is your friendly neighborhood lush\nI crack your bottle then watch how Xzibit bust\nI regulate like a killer with a nickel plate, I set it straight\nStart to shakin you down, breakin new ground, construction work\nHeavy artillery, put your dick in the dirt\nStay alert, the game is rough so you might get hurt\nSlug burnt through your jacket through your sweater, through your shirt\nGet cut from the belly up (What?)\nI break the chain, fast lane, suck my sugar cane\nI'm tryin to spark a nigga brain while you entertain trivial things\nMaterial things, protected by the underground kings\nWho rule the land with an iron fist\nThe Men in Black, if we flash can't remember shit (Sorry)\nYou cross me, I'll make you pay like the government, I wanna kill Sam\nCause my package came short twelve grams, get the picture?\n\n[Bridge]\nPlayers, pimps, hoes, hustlers\nWillies, thugs, ballers, busters\nGangstas, macks, everyday, all day\nShot callers, even high rollers keep it moving\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat you see is what you get now\nThe kinda style make the whole world go wild\nBless the child that can hold his own, flesh and bone\nAnd no matter where I roam I feel right at home, and that's the real shit"}}, {"title": "Front 2 Back", "album": "Restless", "year": "2000-09-25", "lyrics": "[Bridge]\nOh no, let's get drunk and fuck fo' sho'\nPlease stop runnin yo'

please stand up?\nWith my niggas and my guns, not givin a fuck\nStickin 'em up at point blank range\nThey say the more things change, they stayin the same\nI can't complain\nType of shit that make you wish you was dead\nMake you bite the curb, and stomp down on the back of your head\nBlow it out like a afro pick\nAttract bitches like flies to shit\nPop pills and ride the dick\nNiggas can't swing this quick, I'm Dark McGwire\nBangin shit over the fence with Rockwilder\nListen, niggas do anything for a dollar, even\nKillin they own, let it be known, it's like\n\n[Hook]\nIt ain't safe where I'm from\nNiggas start beef never knowin the outcome\nRather be caught with it than caught without one\nLeave it alone because the life that you save might be your own\nIt ain't safe where I'm from\nNiggas start beef never knowin the outcome\nRather be caught with it than caught without one\nLeave it alone because the life that you save might be your own\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm pullin pistols if you don't break bread\nMr. Wrong Side of the Bed, only get excited for head\nNow print this in your industry books\nIf it wasn't for crooks you niggas'd still sport the Jordache look\nHit the switch, front to back, side to side\nNatural born killers never let shit slide\nNever rely on the next man to swing for you\nA rock and a hard place, duck between the two\nAnd y'all bitches just somethin to do, don't get it twisted\nYou're easy like Sunday mornin and shopliftin\nIt go simple as that, I'm never givin half to a rat\nI'd rather bam to your face with a bat\nYou get tied down to the tracks\nUsed to make a living cookin coke to crack, now I can't turn back\nThis is holocaust rap nigga, overreact\nAnd I'mma bring to yo' chest like an asthma attack, ya heard?\n\n[Hook]\nIt ain't safe where I'm from\nNiggas start beef never knowin the outcome\nRather be caught with it than caught without one\nLeave it alone because the life that you save might be your own\nIt ain't safe where

dropped, like a filthy habit\nX snatch and grab it, got you hopin' I fail\n\u2018Cause if I fail you'd be happy like a faggot in jail\nI'm full retail, guaranteed to sell\nIn my jet black McLaren, with my mademoiselle\nI'm strong-arm steady, you fragile and frail\nYou think you ready for them steady niggas? I can't tell\nSex sells, so fuck you all, we came to bubble and ball\nYou gettin' shut down, soon as I touch down\nBust rounds, enemies slayed and cut down\nFully automatic, spittin' rounds with no sound\nBreak down your whole regime, like an M-16\nMake sure the chamber in the barrel is clean\nAnd the spring that's connected to the firin' pin\nThat's connected to the trigger, when I squeeze it again, begin\n\n[Bridge]\nLook, my top of the world, the best of the best\nKing California, LAX\nOut the hood, in the penthouse, from the projects\nOne man, one gun, how the West was won, sing\n\n[Hook]\nIt's so frustratin', so many hatin'\nSomebody gon' make me break the law\nBut I ain't waitin', there's no escapin'\nYou better get ready for the war\n\n[Verse 2]\nHit like a heavyweight, breathe deep, meditate\nMake the whole crowd get loud, make 'em levitate\nI ride through my city, like a presidential candidate\nLAX, Phantom double R, and accelerate\nStack, build, elevate, crash through the prison gate\nGeneration hate, appetite to eliminate\nX-Man don't spit rhymes, I ventilate\nTraffic contraband, yeah, banned through the interstate\nGot a sick flow, didn't know? Let me demonstrate\nRenovate the game, new nigga that you love to hate\nThe left hand lands, and the right hand devastates\nHalf part of your face, replaced with a metal plate\nIrate, get snatched to a better place\nLet the detec's decorate with the yellow tape\nDetonate, drop bombs, make the earth shake\nIn Brazil, with a half mil' in the briefcase\n\n[Bridge]\nLook, my top of the world, the best of the best\nKing California, LAX\nOut the hood, in the penthouse, from the projects\nOne man, one gun, how the West was won, sing\n\n[Hook]\nIt's so frustratin', so many hatin'\nSomebody gon' make me

concentrate\n\n{\"Nam Myoho Renge Kyo\" continues to repeat in the background}\n\n[Xzibit]\nMeditate, levitate\nGreetings from the Golden State\nMr. X, to the Z\nConcentrate, come walk with me\nYour shit sound so awkwardly\nI don't rhyme I just stomp down beats\nReal estate, section eight\nWhich one would you rather take?\nConcentrate, move that weight\nShow me how you regulate\nHold up, wait, that shit's fake\nGet these niggas up out my face\nShake the room, bend the spoon\nTurn this up now, stay in tune\nHypnotized by the way she move\nTake your time you might arrive too soon\n\n[Hook One]\n\n[Hook Two: Xzibit over 4X of \"Nam Myoho Renge Kyo\"]\nBring that back, what was that?\nOh my lord, she got back\nSo precise, so deattached\nOh my God, who is that?\n\n[Xzibit]\nHibernate, consummate\nMan was made to procreate\nMy estate, generates\nAs if my family name was Gates\nDays of grace, lift big plates\nWhy be good nigga, go be great\nHit the breaks, crack them crates\nHave you on the run goin state to state\nContemplate, demonstrate\nMind over mayhem, no mistakes\nLift some weights, eat some steaks\nBut you don't really want that face to face\nBut let's relax, check your traps\nDon't let yo' concentration snap\nI love the way she arch her back\nLike how a muh'fucker 'sposed to handle that?\n\n[Hook One] + [Hook Two]\n\n[Xzibit]\nBreath control, touch yo' soul\nJust maintain don't lose control\nParticipate, congratulate\nCause everything else'll be seen as hate\nRemain in place, the same mindstate\nGet off yo' ass and celebrate\nCongregate, associate\nDon't fuck yo'self procrastinate\nDilate, to an all time great\nCalculate the next move I make\nCrack the safe, keep that ace\nIn my waistband just in case\nI'm no rat can't run yo' race\nNot too good don't fit my taste\nI love the way she make that shake\nMakin it hard to concentrate\n\n[Hook Two] + [Hook One]\n\n[28 seconds of instrumental]\n\n{\"Nam Myoho Renge Kyo\" - repeat 4X right before song's end}"}}, {"title": "3 Card Molly", "album": "40 Days & 40 Nightz", "year": "1998-11-17", "lyrics": "[Intro: Ras Kass]\nWhat, yeah, yeah\nBlack John McClane, Harold the Menace, and the Waterproof\nWith my nigga Bud'da, on the track\nGolden State Warriors..\nEatin every rapper on the plate\nHuh, feel me\n\n[Verse 1: Ras Kass]\nI got three-oh-fo's in three-one-oh\nOn section eight, with multiple one-eighty-sevens\nSport a Marilyn Manson t-shirt when I die and go to heaven\nSmoke a beady, scrape my lungs, smoke the resin\nRemember the name Ras Kass-ciano\nGet to clownin y'all punk bitches, cause I'm a Mac, like Ronald\nI make Mac make money, and mack murder wack rappers\nMy Makaveli verse Bomb First, the Mac-11'll gat cha\nWhen I get at cha, the situation tenses\nFatality (Toasty!) before you ever reach your senses\nGot so-called riders, crashing into brick fences\nLike my name was Al Fayed so you die, like that white princess\nIf you lookin for sympathy, you better look\nBetween R and T, in the fucking dictionary\nSee the object of the game is to win, stack some ends, sippin Henn'\nWhip a Benz and leave it to your next of kin\n\n[Chorus: Rass Kas, Saafir & Xzibit]\nPick a card any card, I bet you can't pull it\nGolden State, number one with a bullet\nIt's three card molly\nWill they ever stop?\nProbably not\nPull your spine through your mouth and watch your body drop\nPick a card any card, I bet you can't pull it\nGolden State, number one with a bullet\nIt's three card molly\nWill they ever stop?\nProbably not\nPull your spine through your mouth and watch your body drop\n\n[Verse 2: Saafir]\nThe un-edited medic, on the cut, with a degree in metaphysics\nA doctor, with a lot of patients/patience\nAnd perseverance -- flows like an ocean liner\nThat sails/sales like a clearance, I'm bilingual\nFly like a flamingo, I'm a pitcha, everything I freak\nI heat like Al Pacino, you don't like me baby\nYou ain't happy, you need some Ecstasy\nNow you in my properties, but you have to pay my equity\nFor the lowest point in my character\nI'll reach the highest place in the house when I rock\nLike the Qu'ran, fuse hot, fluid with flavor like buillion cube\nBeen this way since I was fourteen\nAnd like this I been runnin shit without the use of Sportscreme\nRippin up tracks like immigrant Chinese, peep the game I lay\nI'm grim, I brim over my brow when I rip\nNever write rhymes with slim fingertips\nEach syllable you choose to use is light as a flower\nKeep tryin to go gold\nBut all you're gettin is a golden shower\n\n[Chorus: Rass Kas, Saafir & Xzibit]\nPick a card any card, I bet you can't pull it\nGolden State, number one with a bullet\nIt's three card molly\nWill they ever stop?\nProbably not\nPull your spine through your mouth and watch your body drop\nPick a card any card, I bet you can't pull it\nGolden State, number one with a bullet\nIt's three card molly\nWill they ever stop?\nProbably not\nPull your spine through your mouth and watch your body drop\n\n[Verse 3: Xzibit]\nLook, now if it wasn't for the West\nThese rap niggas wouldn't need a vest around they chest\nKeep bustin about where you rest, and what you own, and what you drive\nSo the day some niggas come for you I'm really not surprised\nMr. Black Bruce Willis, please don't kill us\nI show mercy like Kevorkian, like a scorpion\nWe sting you from behind and put it in you, so meet me at the venue\nPut you on the spot to put you on the menu\nFricasseed emcee, we be the ones that keep the pussy hot\nXzibit livin life, like a bull inside a china shop\nStrippin everything, see you ain't even got a dime to drop\nGo ahead and call the cops, you ain't said nathin\nJerry Spring-you out the studio, then Suge Knight you\nTo the parkin lot, niggas ain't ready for all this heat we got\nPicture yourself crushin Xzibit with your tough talk\nThat's like Christopher Reeves doing the crip walk\n\n[Chorus: Rass Kas, Saafir & Xzibit]\nPick a card any card, I bet you can't pull it\nGolden State, number one with a bullet\nIt's three card molly\nWill they ever stop?\nProbably not\nPull your spine through your mouth and watch your body drop\nPick a

Waterproof\nWith my nigga Bud'da, on the track\nGolden State Warriors..\nEatin every rapper on the plate\nHuh, feel me\n\n[Verse 1: Ras Kass]\nI got three-oh-fo's in three-one-oh\nOn section eight, with multiple one-eighty-sevens\nSport a Marilyn Manson t-shirt when I die and go to heaven\nSmoke a beady, scrape my lungs, smoke the resin\nRemember the name Ras Kass-ciano\nGet to clownin y'all punk bitches, cause I'm a Mac, like Ronald\nI make Mac make money, and mack murder wack rappers\nMy Makaveli verse Bomb First, the Mac-11'll gat cha\nWhen I get at cha, the situation tenses\nFatality (Toasty!) before you ever reach your senses\nGot so-called riders, crashing into brick fences\nLike my name was Al Fayed so you die, like that white princess\nIf you lookin for sympathy, you better look\nBetween R and T, in the fucking dictionary\nSee the object of the game is to win, stack some ends, sippin Henn'\nWhip a Benz and leave it to your next of kin\n\n[Chorus: Rass Kas, Saafir & Xzibit]\nPick a card any card, I bet you can't pull it\nGolden State, number one with a bullet\nIt's three card molly\nWill they ever stop?\nProbably not\nPull your spine through your mouth and watch your body drop\nPick a card any card, I bet you can't pull it\nGolden State, number one with a bullet\nIt's three card molly\nWill they ever stop?\nProbably not\nPull your spine through your mouth and watch your body drop\n\n[Verse 2: Saafir]\nThe un-edited medic, on the cut, with a degree in metaphysics\nA doctor, with a lot of patients/patience\nAnd perseverance -- flows like an ocean liner\nThat sails/sales like a clearance, I'm bilingual\nFly like a flamingo, I'm a pitcha, everything I freak\nI heat like Al Pacino, you don't like me baby\nYou ain't happy, you need some Ecstasy\nNow you in my properties, but you have to pay my equity\nFor the lowest point in my character\nI'll reach the highest place in the house when I rock\nLike the Qu'ran, fuse hot, fluid with flavor like buillion cube\nBeen this way since I was fourteen\nAnd like this I been runnin shit without the use of Sportscreme\nRippin up tracks like immigrant Chinese, peep the game I lay\nI'm grim, I brim over my brow when I rip\nNever write rhymes with slim fingertips\nEach syllable you choose to use is light as a flower\nKeep tryin to go gold\nBut all you're gettin is a golden shower\n\n[Chorus: Rass Kas, Saafir & Xzibit]\nPick a card any card, I bet you can't pull it\nGolden State, number one with a bullet\nIt's three card molly\nWill they ever stop?\nProbably not\nPull your spine through your mouth and watch your body drop\nPick a card any card, I bet you can't pull it\nGolden State, number one with a bullet\nIt's three card molly\nWill they ever stop?\nProbably not\nPull your spine through your mouth and watch your body drop\n\n[Verse 3: Xzibit]\nLook, now if it wasn't for the West\nThese rap niggas wouldn't need a vest around they chest\nKeep bustin about where you rest, and what you own, and what you drive\nSo the day some niggas come for you I'm really not surprised\nMr. Black Bruce Willis, please don't kill us\nI show mercy like Kevorkian, like a scorpion\nWe sting you from behind and put it in you, so meet me at the venue\nPut you on the spot to put you on the menu\nFricasseed emcee, we be the ones that keep the pussy hot\nXzibit livin life, like a bull inside a china shop\nStrippin everything, see you ain't even got a dime to drop\nGo ahead and call the cops, you ain't said nathin\nJerry Spring-you out the studio, then Suge Knight you\nTo the parkin lot, niggas ain't ready for all this heat we got\nPicture yourself crushin Xzibit with your tough talk\nThat's like Christopher Reeves doing the crip walk\n\n[Chorus: Rass Kas, Saafir & Xzibit]\nPick a card any card, I bet you can't pull it\nGolden State, number one with a bullet\nIt's three card molly\nWill they ever stop?\nProbably not\nPull your spine through your mouth and watch your body drop\nPick a card any card, I bet you can't pull it\nGolden State, number one with a bullet\nIt's three card molly\nWill they ever stop?\nProbably not\nPull your spine through your mouth and watch your body

elimination\nThis dedication is for niggas with the green buddha\nThe bandula, six-shooter to your suit coolers\nNow how this feel? Cold black steel up in your grill\nThis hollow point lead gon' be your last meal\nSay your prayers, say your graces\nPieces of your face is found in a hundred different places\nHuh, so what we lookin like? We tryin to see some hoes to fuck tonight\nAnd you just tryin to see the afterlife\nMake a decision before we have a head-on collision\nMakin me spend the rest of my life in prison\nSee I can only play the cards I was given\nMultiplication division whatever you got to break mines off\nLike the U.S. government did to Microsoft\nLike Xzibit in some pussy with the lights turned off\nIt's like\n\n[Hook]\nI'm just livin to fulfill my dreams\nI'm just tryin to have the best of things\nNone of y'all can't take shit from me\nLife's a bitch she ain't fuckin for free\nSo I'mma ride til the wheels fall off\nWhile all the rest get weak and go soft\nYour petite style, can get you beat down\nMy heat's loud, have you huggin on the street now\n\n[Xzibit]\nNiggas keep askin me how does it feel\nHow does WHAT feel? Not havin to scrape for a meal?\nNot bein locked down to a fucked up deal?\nThe biggest man in Los Angeles is not Shaquille\nWe had to reinvent the wheel, draft new blueprints\nMade a whole album, spent HALF what you spent\nThen sent the rest to my people to invest wit it\nCustom fitted, if you want it nigga, come and get it\nAnd I suggest you bring a million niggas runnin wit it\nSplit it, feel it, hit it it's hot, look\nI ain't gon' stop til everybody's shot\nMuammar Khadafi's the dot, X mark the spot\nWith an infrared to your head, left for dead\nFuck the feds, flee the country then grow some dreads (ya mon)\nI suggest you keep your distance, for instance, the same distance\nIt takes to get to the next solar system, motherfucker\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Xzibit]\nStrike one, when a nigga talkin shit with his hands down\nStrike two, gettin caught in the wrong place with your pants down\nStrike three, tryin to fuck with the D-O-double-G\nD-R-E, or any of my Alkaholik family\nHuh, Xzibit turn your vital signs to a straight line\nNever seen a dog bite and bark at the same time\nRestless, rugged, never relaxed\nPermanently owe you motherfuckers backs like tax\nBaseball bats and bricks upside of your head\nHomey STILL gettin swoll off water and bread\nI got this, retaliation, for any situation I'm facin\nAnd leave the stage with a standin ovation, it's like\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "Hey Now (Mean Muggin')", "album": "Weapons of Mass Destruction", "year": "2004-11-16", "lyrics": "[Timbaland]\nOh!

Got the world saying my name\nI'm 'bout to make a little change, I'mma keep it the same, ya dig\nX to the Z baby, run up on you hitting corners\nPhantom platinum grill, c'mon\nX be the life of the party\nDon't be scared girl, reach out and touch somebody\n\n[Hook: Keri Hilson]\nCan you feel the speakers jumping? (yeah!)\nOther guys surrounding but they don't say nothing (yeah!)\nMuggin in the club like they wanna do something (yeah!)\nFeeling kinda rowdy huh? hey now! hey now!

Look where I live\n40 acres and a Maybach Benz\nYou wanted to party but I got biz\nThis ain't entertainment, I'm feeding my kid\nOn a 4 or 5 in the carpool lane\nGot to hit some corners, I'm riding the caine\nWanna ride out to a island and tan your frame\nAnd just waste away a couple of days, holla back at me!\nLook where I bat\nMake the crowd get loud like the sound of a gat\nL.A. on my baseball hat\nWhere they running right up on you in that black on black\nSo move - better - bounce like a mother\nWhen brother got Mass Weapons of war with each other\nX gettin big, not ready to die yet\nMy militant mindset got you running for cover, so yo!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm the life of the party\nI got a moon roof! We poppin up out of\nLook at the whole world! They talking about us\nI got a mean hook! To rattle yo body\n\n[Verse 3]\nI wanna, talk a little, pick ya brain\nWanna see you in something little, walk around the plane\nYeah! I got a lot to gain\nGetting my label off the ground like David Blaine\nSo now, what you know bout me?!\nI'm a self made man from poverty\nYeah! Now I own a lot of property\nI \"pimp rides,\" lifestyles, and companies, so yo!\nNow let me spit you the facts\nI used to hustle the corner, but I ain't bringing you that\nNaw! I'm like swinging a bat\nRun at yo kneecaps for comin out ya face like that\nBaby girl touching my chain (oh!)\nNow let me tell you who I ain't (oh!)\nYou can't run no games\n(I'm gangster, baby ain't

C'mon! Oh! Ah! C'mon!\n\n[Verse 1: Xzibit]\nI'm a - menace to society baby\nThe police wanna relocate me\nThey running with gun up but they can't fade me\nThey wanted to come up but they ain't crazy\nI ride one in the chamber, with gun on cock\n'6-tre Chevrolet rollin without no top\nGot them hydraulics that's dumping, making it drop\nCalifornia to Virginia Timmy making it hot (WOOO!!!)\nTaking long rides in the G4 plane\nX Man to the stage, got 'em going insane\nYeah! Got the world saying my name\nI'm 'bout to make a little change, I'mma keep it the same, ya dig\nX to the Z baby, run up on you hitting corners\nPhantom platinum grill, c'mon\nX be the life of the party\nDon't be scared girl, reach out and touch somebody\n\n[Hook: Keri Hilson]\nCan you feel the speakers jumping? (yeah!)\nOther guys surrounding but they don't say nothing (yeah!)\nMuggin in the club like they wanna do something (yeah!)\nFeeling kinda rowdy huh? hey now! hey now! (slow down!)\nAll the girls mean muggin (yeah!)\nCause they musta seen what the girl pulled up in (yeah!)\nIn the club like they wanna do something (yeah!)\nFeeling kinda rowdy huh? hey now! hey now! (slow down!)\n\n[Verse 2]\nHey girl! Look where I live\n40 acres and a Maybach Benz\nYou wanted to party but I got biz\nThis ain't entertainment, I'm feeding my kid\nOn a 4 or 5 in the carpool lane\nGot to hit some corners, I'm riding the caine\nWanna ride out to a island and tan your frame\nAnd just waste away a couple of days, holla back at me!\nLook where I bat\nMake the crowd get loud like the sound of a gat\nL.A. on my baseball hat\nWhere they running right up on you in that black on black\nSo move - better - bounce like a mother\nWhen brother got Mass Weapons of war with each other\nX gettin big, not ready to die yet\nMy militant mindset got you running for cover, so yo!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm the life of the party\nI got a moon roof! We poppin up out of\nLook at the whole world! They talking about us\nI got a mean hook! To rattle yo body\n\n[Verse 3]\nI wanna, talk a little, pick ya brain\nWanna see you in something little, walk around the plane\nYeah! I got a lot to gain\nGetting my label off the ground like David Blaine\nSo now, what you know bout me?!\nI'm a self made man from poverty\nYeah! Now I own a lot of property\nI \"pimp rides,\" lifestyles, and companies, so yo!\nNow let me spit you the facts\nI used to hustle the corner, but I ain't bringing you that\nNaw! I'm like swinging a bat\nRun at yo kneecaps for comin out ya face like that\nBaby girl touching my chain (oh!)\nNow let me tell you who I ain't (oh!)\nYou can't run no games\n(I'm gangster, baby ain't nothing changed)\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "Choke Me, Spank Me (Pull My Hair)", "album": "Man vs Machine", "year": null, "lyrics": "[Hook: girl - repeat 4X]\nChoke me, spank me, pull my hair\n\n[Xzibit]\nCinnamon, with a taste of honey, it ain't funny\nWhen she walk in the room, I can't help actin a fool\nI know what she like, she act right\nShe act like she ain't gon' survive the night\nWithout my dick all up in her ass, so quick, so fast\nI see her twin towers and I'm ready to crash\nWalk around naked witcha beautiful ass\nWho the fuck taught ya how to move that fast?\nIt took time to perfect the stroke, by any note\nMaybe we really don't need to drink and smoke\nAnd just try a new position, perfect your dick kissin\nBang on your G-spot 'til your (voice is missin)\n\n[Interlude: Xzibit - repeat 2X]\nI don't want to love, you\nI just want to fuck, you\nYou should bring your friends, through\nI'll fuck you and them, too\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Xzibit]\nI work hard when I'm breakin your back, my lil' nyphomaniac\nSuck it, swallow it, down the hatch\nIt ain't a game when she givin me brain, she doin her thang\nI'm up all night but I never complain\nI don't, waste no time with makeup lines\nI just, look in her eyes and read the signs\nA lot of dudes wanna pull on her arm\nCause her ass and titties light up a room like a major city\nJust look how she fit in them jeans, it ain't fair\nShe get off too quick, when I pull on her hair\nI'm the only nigga that can take you there\nI ain't the only one fuckin and I don't care!\nShe come through with a couple of friends, a couple bottles of gin\nAnd then, that's where the party begins\nAnd I'm the only nigga that's around for blocks\nBaby get on top, and don't you stop!\n\n[Interlude]\n\n[Xzibit]\nI know you love the way I'm diggin it out\nI know it's hard to talk with all this dick in your mouth\nMenage-a-trois, for moi, let's figure this out\nI drink a Hennessy fifth and sweat the shit out\nShe don't gotta cheat cause it's a waste of her time\nShe'll never find another dick that's bigger than mine\nHands and knees side by side, I hit from behind\nFlip it up, givin a fuck, we fuck all night\nBottom line, when I straighten your spine\nI'm gon' find spots that ain't been hit and blow your mind\nGet in line, bitches stay on the grind, cause I'm on mines\nRedecorate your hips and lips and thighs\nAin't surprised you can be so pretty and be so nasty\nAss in the air like a pass to Grassi\nIt's a, thin line between hoes and women\nAnd close my dick with a hat and change the linen\n\n[Interlude]\n\n[Hook] - repeat 2X", "image": "https://images.genius.com/857a416f44825b13b2e0155587142ae2.600x600x1.jpg", "artist": "Xzibit", "raw": {"annotation_count": 2, "api_path":

kissin\nBang on your G-spot 'til your (voice is missin)\n\n[Interlude: Xzibit - repeat 2X]\nI don't want to love, you\nI just want to fuck, you\nYou should bring your friends, through\nI'll fuck you and them, too\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Xzibit]\nI work hard when I'm breakin your back, my lil' nyphomaniac\nSuck it, swallow it, down the hatch\nIt ain't a game when she givin me brain, she doin her thang\nI'm up all night but I never complain\nI don't, waste no time with makeup lines\nI just, look in her eyes and read the signs\nA lot of dudes wanna pull on her arm\nCause her ass and titties light up a room like a major city\nJust look how she fit in them jeans, it ain't fair\nShe get off too quick, when I pull on her hair\nI'm the only nigga that can take you there\nI ain't the only one fuckin and I don't care!\nShe come through with a couple of friends, a couple bottles of gin\nAnd then, that's where the party begins\nAnd I'm the only nigga that's around for blocks\nBaby get on top, and don't you stop!\n\n[Interlude]\n\n[Xzibit]\nI know you love the way I'm diggin it out\nI know it's hard to talk with all this dick in your mouth\nMenage-a-trois, for moi, let's figure this out\nI drink a Hennessy fifth and sweat the shit out\nShe don't gotta cheat cause it's a waste of her time\nShe'll never find another dick that's bigger than mine\nHands and knees side by side, I hit from behind\nFlip it up, givin a fuck, we fuck all night\nBottom line, when I straighten your spine\nI'm gon' find spots that ain't been hit and blow your mind\nGet in line, bitches stay on the grind, cause I'm on mines\nRedecorate your hips and lips and thighs\nAin't surprised you can be so pretty and be so nasty\nAss in the air like a pass to Grassi\nIt's a, thin line between hoes and women\nAnd close my dick with a hat and change the linen\n\n[Interlude]\n\n[Hook] - repeat 2X"}}, {"title": "Louis XIII", "album": "Napalm", "year": "2012-10-09", "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Xzibit, King-T & Tha

You", "album": "Full Circle", "year": "2006-12-11", "lyrics": "[Xzibit] Yo, listen, huh\n\n[Hook: Xzibit]\nI just wanna thank you, for bein around\nAnd patiently waitin and holdin me down\nIt's easy to see, for Mr. X to the Z\nThat without no you, there could be no me\nI just wanna thank you, for bein a fan\nAnd watchin me grow from a boy to a man\nIt's easy to see, for Mr. X to the Z\nThat without no you, there could be no me\n\n[Xzibit]\nYou 'bout to hear some words, that you ain't probably heard\nWith all of these rappers pullin' triggers and flippin' birds\nI know it sound absurd, cause they don't tell the truth\nThey prostitutes, fuckin' contaminate the youth\nBut yet I'm guilty of, the things I said above\nNo matter my faults still continue to show me love\nNaw I ain't perfect mayne, but yet I stay the same\nI play chess not checkers but this is not a game\nAnd this is not a song, and this is not a verse\nIt's not conceived, or simulated or been rehearsed\nSpent the first half of my life, thinkin that I was cursed\nCould have been hit with a hollow, follow behind my hearse\nThat wasn't meant for me, I spent a decade\nMakin it what it's 'sposed to be, hopefully brought you close to me\nAll these people approachin me, don't even know the half\nI could be facin life but X is signin autographs, damn\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Xzibit]\nMy son's 11 now, I got to see him grow\nMakin his free throws, the way he laughin at the show\nYo he remind me of me, when I was ridin bikes\nHe gon' be taller than me, he got my mother's height\nBut yo you know the difference, between me and them others\nThey say you buggin when I call you my sisters and brothers\nI coulda missed it all, I coulda dropped the ball\nMind of Metallica, motherfuck 'em and \"Kill 'Em All\"\nI used to hustle raw, I used to run the streets\nI used to hustle heats, I grinded all my beef\nMost of my homies is gone, restin in peace\nSome'll never see release from custody of police, but me\nBut nah my little dude get to go to private school\nAnd I can do the things my father couldn't afford to do\nThat's what it's 'sposed to do, this is from me to you\nSupport from you and yours, thank you for gettin me through, true\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Xzibit]\nWe buried Proof today, it really broke me up\nTo see my brother in that casket, maaan what the fuck?\nMedia made me angry, I had to soak it up\nThe future is fragile never promised to none of us\nHittin so close to home, but what I focused on\nIs how he lived, the lives he touched, the cornerstone\nWe never walk alone, although sometime it seems\nThat nightmares go hand in hand with livin out dreams\nSo let me take this time, from my struggle my grind\nTo let you know that I appreciate you by my side\nIt's been a long ride, a lot of long nights\nA lot of long flights, worth every sacrifice\nA soldier of fortune fearless fightin the good fight\nI never had a plan B, I never lost sight\nThat's why I hit the stage, that's why I kill

"[Xzibit] Yo, listen, huh\n\n[Hook: Xzibit]\nI just wanna thank you, for bein around\nAnd patiently waitin and holdin me down\nIt's easy to see, for Mr. X to the Z\nThat without no you, there could be no me\nI just wanna thank you, for bein a fan\nAnd watchin me grow from a boy to a man\nIt's easy to see, for Mr. X to the Z\nThat without no you, there could be no me\n\n[Xzibit]\nYou 'bout to hear some words, that you ain't probably heard\nWith all of these rappers pullin' triggers and flippin' birds\nI know it sound absurd, cause they don't tell the truth\nThey prostitutes, fuckin' contaminate the youth\nBut yet I'm guilty of, the things I said above\nNo matter my faults still continue to show me love\nNaw I ain't perfect mayne, but yet I stay the same\nI play chess not checkers but this is not a game\nAnd this is not a song, and this is not a verse\nIt's not conceived, or simulated or been rehearsed\nSpent the first half of my life, thinkin that I was cursed\nCould have been hit with a hollow, follow behind my hearse\nThat wasn't meant for me, I spent a decade\nMakin it what it's 'sposed to be, hopefully brought you close to me\nAll these people approachin me, don't even know the half\nI could be facin life but X is signin autographs, damn\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Xzibit]\nMy son's 11 now, I got to see him grow\nMakin his free throws, the way he laughin at the show\nYo he remind me of me, when I was ridin bikes\nHe gon' be taller than me, he got my mother's height\nBut yo you know the difference, between me and them others\nThey say you buggin when I call you my sisters and brothers\nI coulda missed it all, I coulda dropped the ball\nMind of Metallica, motherfuck 'em and \"Kill 'Em All\"\nI used to hustle raw, I used to run the streets\nI used to hustle heats, I grinded all my beef\nMost of my homies is gone, restin in peace\nSome'll never see release from custody of police, but me\nBut nah my little dude get to go to private school\nAnd I can do the things my father couldn't afford to do\nThat's what it's 'sposed to do, this is from me to you\nSupport from you and yours, thank you for gettin me through, true\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Xzibit]\nWe buried Proof today, it really broke me up\nTo see my brother in that casket, maaan what the fuck?\nMedia made me angry, I had to soak it up\nThe future is fragile never promised to none of us\nHittin so close to home, but what I focused on\nIs how he lived, the lives he touched, the cornerstone\nWe never walk alone, although sometime it seems\nThat nightmares go hand in hand with livin out dreams\nSo let me take this time, from my struggle my grind\nTo let you know that I appreciate you by my side\nIt's been a long ride, a lot of long nights\nA lot of long flights, worth every sacrifice\nA soldier of fortune fearless fightin the good fight\nI never had a plan B, I never lost sight\nThat's why I hit the stage, that's why I kill the mic\nIt's for my fans that's ridin with Xzibit for life, RIGHT!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro]\nThank you, for lettin me breathe\nFor lettin me be who I am, huh, yeah, huh\nTwo little words, y'all never get to hear enough\nKnahmsayin?

told your momma to push\nNow here you are, I see you're feeling strong\nMy prediction came here tripping, you won't be living long\nWait, I said that wrong, now let's negotiate\nI wave my banner of peace, I hope you take the bait\nPussy nigga, you fake, can't wait for the face to face\nHit you with the gauge, back in place\nRip another page off the book of life\nBut for tonight we gon' celebrate and smoke 'till we elevate\nMy motive for motivating my niggas, come on\n\n[Hook: Wiz Khalifa and (Xzibit)]\nTake a look at my eyes and tell me what do you see\n(I'm going forever be me, therefore, I'm forever a G)\nAll this liquor I drink and then I smoke all this weed\n(Smoking this weed, smoking is good, but I got what you need)\nA lot of niggas are changed and they be doing what I've been\n(Won't you change, I want you stay the same)\nBut I'll always be the same, I'll always gonna keep it G\n(I'm going forever be me, therefore, I'm forever a G)\n\n[Verse 2: Xzibit]\n\nIt's getting hard to survive, the streets will eat you alive\nDumping your body, your cadaver is covered with flies\nToo much ratchets and trapping inside your rapping\nReal niggas actually laughing at your lights, camera, action\nDo you, do you\nAnd whatever the fuck you think you gotta do\nBecause when I bring it through, we whole court\nPutting up playoff stats\nWhile you're hanging with the roaches and rats\nWe're way above that\nNow how you're loving that?\nBeat the breaks off the back of that bitch\nYou can't breathe, I'm digging your ditch\nCan't believe I'm that deep in your shit\nBut for tonight we gon' celebrate and smoke 'till we elevate\nMy motive for motivating my niggas, come on\n\n[Hook: Wiz Khalifa and (Xzibit)]\nTake a look at my eyes and tell me what do you see\n(I'm going forever be me, therefore, I'm forever a G)\nAll this liquor I drink and then I smoke all this weed\n(Smoking this weed, smoking is good, but I got what you need)\nA lot of niggas are changed and they be doing what I've been\n(Won't you change, I want you stay the same)\nBut I'll always be the same, I'll always gonna keep it G\n(I'm going forever be me, therefore, I'm forever a G)\n\n[Verse 3: Xzibit]\n\nThe greatest trick the devil ever put together\nWas that self destruction is better than striving for perfection\nA seed of doubt could grow, quickly spread like an infection\nInitiative to live, use your common sense as a weapon\nIf you only knew half of this shit that I've been through\nShould've been a screen play when I get through\nBlow niggas away, IED, point blank range in the middle of the street\nFuck y'all niggas gonna say to me?\nWe don't play no games, just play for keeps and now\nBack to the forefront, back to the back who was back on the tour bus\nGet around the world for a few months\nDump dead-weight niggas like a dump truck\nBut for tonight we gon' celebrate and smoke 'till we elevate\nMy motive for motivating my niggas, come on\n\n[Hook: Wiz Khalifa and (Xzibit)]\nTake a look at my eyes and tell me what do you see\n(I'm going forever be me, therefore, I'm forever a G)\nAll this liquor I drink and then I smoke all this weed\n(Smoking this weed, smoking is good, but I got what you need)\nA lot of niggas are changed and they be doing what I've been\n(Won't you change, I want you stay the same)\nBut I'll always be the same, I'll always gonna

{\"break 'em off somethin\"}\n\"Back to the criminal set... but they can't catch me yet\" - Ice Cube\nYour gum bumpin gon' lead to gun bumpin {\"break 'em off somethin\"}\nI'm the one when the party is jumpin to {\"break 'em off somethin\"}\n\n[Xzibit]\nI heard the O.G.'s they don't hit\nAnd I'm the only one left from the West that you can't fuck with\nBut lately I've been feelin like Will Smith\nWhy bother with rap when I can get 20 mill' on a flick?\nY'all niggas just started some shit, the underdog\nMakin songs for them hogs, and them Bloods and Crips\nFor the shah by the mall with a Muslim scent\nAfter all, who do you call to rock your shit? {\"break 'em off somethin\"}\nBust the ghetto bird, circle above, reminisce\nOf the dust kicked up, the dirt swept under the rug\nDuct tape, ski-mask, tape recorders\nCue K's, ready to blaze and bakin' soda\nFirst learned how to cook in a coffee pot\nMade the block get hot like lava rock\nGot love for the block cause I came from that\nBut I ain't afraid to go right back {\"break 'em off somethin\"}\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Xzibit]\nIt's a, suicide it's a suicide\nIf you ever get the heart to try fuckin with mines\nNo change, I'm poppin the nine, you ridin the pine {\"break 'em off somethin\"}\nThe heavy metal knock you out of your mind {\"break 'em off somethin\"}\nNow how many really gon' ride, when the war start?\nEaten alive by these hollow-tip darts\nMy 12 gauge'll tear you apart, don't get caught at the light\nThe house party or the neighborhood park\nMr. X marks the spot then pops the mark\nTurn your whole neighborhood to a parkin lot\nI paid the cost to be the boss\nAnd will do my time standin up 'til I get an appeal\nThese weapons too real to conceal, so why bother\nSemper fidelis, I learned from my father\nI always stay faithful to myself and grow\nBut when I catch that ass after the show - {\"break 'em off somethin\"}\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Xzibit]\nI'm slick and slippery\nOn a high-speed chase all the way to the victory\nY'all niggas is stone cold mysteries\nToo weak, can't stand in the ring with me\nPut a pussy back in his place, straightlaced\nWith a Strong Arm Steady gang up in your face\nI run a race with the West to my back\nWhile you're the reason why they say niggas in the West can't rap\nEver since the white Concourse 'Llac, I've been unmatched\nA avalanche in the hood on attack\nJust hardcore actual facts, never wait\nJust react when them killers come at you with gats\nHad to dig the knife out of my back, now I'm back on track\nHittin laps, 'bout to widen the gap yo\nIt ain't the long fall from the top that got 'em\nIt was the sharp sudden stop at the bottom, haha {\"break 'em off somethin\"}\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "D.N.A (Drugs-N-Alkahol)", "album": "Restless", "year": "2000-12-12",

Harris:]\nMy name is staff sergeant Shilo Harris, retired United States army\nUnfortunately, while serving our nation\nI was hit with a roadside bomb that was estimated at about 800 pounds of explosives\nI lost 3 soldiers, my truck was destroyed\nMy driver and I were the only 2 soldiers out of that vehicle that survived\n\n[Hook:]\nSo what's the meaning of life, what's the meaning of life?\nMan I don't know, I don't know\nCuz all I know is when I grab the microphone and they let me up on the stage\nGrand larceny, cause I'm stealin' the show\nWhat's the meaning of life, what's the meaning of life?\nMan I couldn't tell ya, I can't tell ya\nAll I know if you spend too much time without being refined\nThen your life will be described as a failure\n\n[Verse 1:]\nLet me tell you about these bitch ass, half cocked, pussy ass niggas\nThat's never gon' pull the trigger to protect no figures\nNever seen a hard time in your life\nBeating the shit out of your kids and your wife\nCause what you lack in a fight\nThat we all fightin' a similar, self-hated mutilation\nThe lost angel, Los Angeles, congratulations\nFrom admiration, to aggravation, to the highest level\nDon't be surprised you all alone when that dust settle\nHeart colder than gun metal, I done survived it all\nPraying for my downfall, got the fuck from around y'all\nNo more niggas bringing me down, even including myself\nI celebrate life for nobody else\nMountains of wealth ain't really shit without health\nMy mental shrouded in stealth\nCause hell is crowded with cowards who fell for the dollar\nNow watch Xzibit rise to power\nI turn these 15 minutes to hours\nBut still asking\n\n[Hook:]\nWhat's the meaning of life, what's the meaning of life?\nMan I don't know, I don't know\nCuz all I know is when I grab the microphone and they let me up on the stage\nGrand larceny cause I'm stealin' the show\nWhat's the meaning of life, what's the meaning of life?\nMan I couldn't tell ya, I can't tell ya\nAll I know if you spend too much time without being refined\nThen your life will be described as a failure\n\n[Verse 2:]\nLet me tell you bout' these hypocrites and halfwits\nCaught up in the politics\nWork yourself to death, but uncle Sam is taking all of it\nPrisoner to the policy, the mark of the beast\nBecoming one with technology, surveillance a beach (bitch)\nAnd everyone one of us, some of us got no heart or no backbone\nThe few will seek freedom while most of the masses will conform\nThe woman you lust for, is usually not the one\nTo stick around when you go to war\nImmaculate platform\nWe back and prepared for, attacking the landlords\nCause this shit too hot, we 'bout to get what we came for\nAnd if I should die, may it not be in vain more\nImportantly, more to see, keep it cracking and orderly\nGot my future in front of me, focus is fucking phenomenal\nNobody can touch us, I turn the impossible possible with it\nDo me a favor man, do not try to tell me shit\nIt's just me and my bitch\n\n[Hook:]\nWhat's the meaning of life, what's the meaning of life?\nMan I don't know, I don't know\nCuz all I know is when I grab the microphone and they let me up on the stage\nGrand larceny cause I'm stealin' the show\nWhat's the meaning of life, what's the meaning of life?\nMan I couldn't tell ya, I can't tell ya\nAll I know if you spend too much time without being refined\nThen your life will be described as a failure\n\n[Shilo Harris:]\nWhen I was injured, I sustained 35% burns over my body\nI lost my ears, my nose, and have been through many reconstructive surgeries\nMy father was there, my wife was there, my children\nThat was a lot of my motivation, was because\nI knew the way that they were looking at me\nI had to get stronger, I had to become independent again\nAnd I think that's why I pushed so hard\n\n[Verse 3:]\nLet me tell you 'bout these long days and sleepless nights\nPenny pinchin' trying to make it to the afterlife\nAnd not to mention time is short, you better make it right\nBefore you see that final light get all your business tight\nThis is the gospel, gotta get it or get left alone\nSo get it on until your destiny is set in stone\nThe dead and gone can never tell us what comes after death\nSo make it count and live your life out loud with no regrets\nThis for the set, this for the ones that's never wakin' up\nLivin' a fantasy, insanity, they fake as fuck\nThey out of touch, they out of line, it's time to face the truth\nThat I wasn't supposed to make it, now I'm living proof\nExcavated mountains of misery, eventually found the fountain of youth\nIt'd been pissed in, shit in, violated, so they pollute\nThat's why they shoot, have your ass in a box dressed in a suit\n'Bout time you got in touch with your roots\n\n[Hook:]\nSo what's the meaning of life, what's the meaning of life?\nMan I don't know, I don't know\nCuz all I know is when I grab the microphone and they let me up on the stage\nGrand larceny cause I'm stealin' the show\nWhat's the meaning of life?\n\n[Shilo Harris:]\nThe best help that you can do, is help yourself\nYou have to, to step up, you have to find the strength inside of you\nTo pull yourself through it, because, you know, you can\nYou can have people pull you everyday\nBut unless you're willing to move, and you're willing to move forward\nThen you're gonna be stuck in a rut\nAnd you're gonna be stuck in that bad place that is depressing\nAnd holding you back\nThe only person that can set you free is yourself", "image":

army\nUnfortunately, while serving our nation\nI was hit with a roadside bomb that was estimated at about 800 pounds of explosives\nI lost 3 soldiers, my truck was destroyed\nMy driver and I were the only 2 soldiers out of that vehicle that survived\n\n[Hook:]\nSo what's the meaning of life, what's the meaning of life?\nMan I don't know, I don't know\nCuz all I know is when I grab the microphone and they let me up on the stage\nGrand larceny, cause I'm stealin' the show\nWhat's the meaning of life, what's the meaning of life?\nMan I couldn't tell ya, I can't tell ya\nAll I know if you spend too much time without being refined\nThen your life will be described as a failure\n\n[Verse 1:]\nLet me tell you about these bitch ass, half cocked, pussy ass niggas\nThat's never gon' pull the trigger to protect no figures\nNever seen a hard time in your life\nBeating the shit out of your kids and your wife\nCause what you lack in a fight\nThat we all fightin' a similar, self-hated mutilation\nThe lost angel, Los Angeles, congratulations\nFrom admiration, to aggravation, to the highest level\nDon't be surprised you all alone when that dust settle\nHeart colder than gun metal, I done survived it all\nPraying for my downfall, got the fuck from around y'all\nNo more niggas bringing me down, even including myself\nI celebrate life for nobody else\nMountains of wealth ain't really shit without health\nMy mental shrouded in stealth\nCause hell is crowded with cowards who fell for the dollar\nNow watch Xzibit rise to power\nI turn these 15 minutes to hours\nBut still asking\n\n[Hook:]\nWhat's the meaning of life, what's the meaning of life?\nMan I don't know, I don't know\nCuz all I know is when I grab the microphone and they let me up on the stage\nGrand larceny cause I'm stealin' the show\nWhat's the meaning of life, what's the meaning of life?\nMan I couldn't tell ya, I can't tell ya\nAll I know if you spend too much time without being refined\nThen your life will be described as a failure\n\n[Verse 2:]\nLet me tell you bout' these hypocrites and halfwits\nCaught up in the politics\nWork yourself to death, but uncle Sam is taking all of it\nPrisoner to the policy, the mark of the beast\nBecoming one with technology, surveillance a beach (bitch)\nAnd everyone one of us, some of us got no heart or no backbone\nThe few will seek freedom while most of the masses will conform\nThe woman you lust for, is usually not the one\nTo stick around when you go to war\nImmaculate platform\nWe back and prepared for, attacking the landlords\nCause this shit too hot, we 'bout to get what we came for\nAnd if I should die, may it not be in vain more\nImportantly, more to see, keep it cracking and orderly\nGot my future in front of me, focus is fucking phenomenal\nNobody can touch us, I turn the impossible possible with it\nDo me a favor man, do not try to tell me shit\nIt's just me and my bitch\n\n[Hook:]\nWhat's the meaning of life, what's the meaning of life?\nMan I don't know, I don't know\nCuz all I know is when I grab the microphone and they let me up on the stage\nGrand larceny cause I'm stealin' the show\nWhat's the meaning of life, what's the meaning of life?\nMan I couldn't tell ya, I can't tell ya\nAll I know if you spend too much time without being refined\nThen your life will be described as a failure\n\n[Shilo Harris:]\nWhen I was injured, I sustained 35% burns over my body\nI lost my ears, my nose, and have been through many reconstructive surgeries\nMy father was there, my wife was there, my children\nThat was a lot of my motivation, was because\nI knew the way that they were looking at me\nI had to get stronger, I had to become independent again\nAnd I think that's why I pushed so hard\n\n[Verse 3:]\nLet me tell you 'bout these long days and sleepless nights\nPenny pinchin' trying to make it to the afterlife\nAnd not to mention time is short, you better make it right\nBefore you see that final light get all your business tight\nThis is the gospel, gotta get it or get left alone\nSo get it on until your destiny is set in stone\nThe dead and gone can never tell us what comes after death\nSo make it count and live your life out loud with no regrets\nThis for the set, this for the ones that's never wakin' up\nLivin' a fantasy, insanity, they fake as fuck\nThey out of touch, they out of line, it's time to face the truth\nThat I wasn't supposed to make it, now I'm living proof\nExcavated mountains of misery, eventually found the fountain of youth\nIt'd been pissed in, shit in, violated, so they pollute\nThat's why they shoot, have your ass in a box dressed in a suit\n'Bout time you got in touch with your roots\n\n[Hook:]\nSo what's the meaning of life, what's the meaning of life?\nMan I don't know, I don't know\nCuz all I know is when I grab the microphone and they let me up on the stage\nGrand larceny cause I'm stealin' the show\nWhat's the meaning of life?\n\n[Shilo Harris:]\nThe best help that you can do, is help yourself\nYou have to, to step up, you have to find the strength inside of you\nTo pull yourself through it, because, you know, you can\nYou can have people pull you everyday\nBut unless you're willing to move, and you're willing to move forward\nThen you're gonna be stuck in a rut\nAnd you're gonna be stuck in that bad place that is depressing\nAnd holding you back\nThe only person that can set you free is yourself"}}, {"title": "Don't Aproach Me", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "Pssh, man I need a lighter man\nRight

Okay, form a straight line\"\nSometimes I feel like loadin' this rifle\nAnd climbin' the roof at night and hidin' outside to snipe you\nIt's not that I don't like you it's just that when I'm not behind the mic\nI'm a person who's just like you"}}, {"title": "Plastic Surgery", "album": "At the Speed of Life", "year": "1996-10-15", "lyrics": "[Saafir:]\nYou have, scars in your mask like Seal\nThat ain't for real\nWe'll have to fix that, yo nigga, sit back\n\n[Xzibit:]\nYour flow remind me of a nigga that I just don't feel\nSame style and delivery\nMight as well have his grill\nPass the scapel, the alcohol, clamps\n25 hundred get you style enhanced\nIt's like...\n\n[Saafir:]\nThis, mask right here will lift your grill\nIt'll put height in your mack\nDon't take to much off\nIf you want a nose like Michael Jackson\n\n[Xzibit:]\nIf you want it done right, nigga come see this\nMaybe even send your bitch\nWe can fix them tits\nFrom a C-cup to a double D-cup\nMake them big shits, doctor lick 'em, yeah\n\n[Saafir:]\nI like to, axe em, jack em for their financial\nNeed a facial, I'll change the skin tone to interracial\nAfter I'm done, you might have a little pouch though\nNothin' my scaple can't fix\nWhat kind of face you want\n(I want the kind that make me look like I can rhyme)\nIt'll cost you\n(But I can find the skrilla, if I can have that nigga face named Saafir!)\nThat's imposterous, plus I never cloned a microphone\nWhat type of shit you on, I hope you got insurance\nBefore I sit you on my gurney\nAnd lead you to an anesthetic breather\nIf you're not broke, I'll save your face like dope and make it right\nCasue being fake ain't tight\nYou need plastic surgery\n\n[Hook:]\nI hear the same ole rhymes, the same ole style\n(It seems you need plastic surgery) x5\n\n[Xzibit:]\nI'm located, at, the bottom of the black list\nI like to malpractice, complicate a surgery\nIntoxicated, smoke cigarettes, drop ashes in your open gases\nFeel the utensil, knife is dull like a pencil\nAnd what?\nWhen a nigga play pussy, get fucked\nWithout a kiss or a hug, I'm like contaminated blood\nTransfused from a junkie\nWith the heroin jones, I reconstruct the bones\nOf all hip hop clones\n\n[Ras Kass:]\nI date fat girls that weigh 215\nWith low self esteem, cause it's easier to get the pussy\nI'm performing vinyl liposuctions\n(Fat MC?)\nPhat production, motherfuckin' facial reconstruction\nNeedles injected 33 RPM of anesthetic for actors who require cosmetic\nSex changes from bitch niggas to rah-rah niggas\nThe only cure for sick lyrics is to implant a hit gimmick\n\n[Saafir:]\nThis shit is full blown, you better head to the clinic\nAfter Captain Save-A-Ho, we had the sex lieutenant\nOperate get straight, we here to separate the fake from the classic\nNiggas get blasted if they plastic\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Ras Kass:]\nI'm like Dougie Howser M.D with a desert eagle\nCriminal Genius\nOperation, separatin' them siamese twins hangin' beneath them niggas' penis\nTake it to your face like a skin graft\nRappers, I specialize in talent transplants\nYou want fat lips nurse get the collagen\nAnd ten tons of stomach pumps from all the cum you and Richard Gere be\nSwallowin'\nNow followin' ask Vanna to buy you vowels\nSo you can see I, aye, E-Swift, oh, you know why\nWe remain uncontested to the contender, we can\nMillion Man March all the way to December\nJanuary, Feburary 28th\n\n[Saafir:]\nI never wash my hands\nThe only rubber gloves I wear is on my dick\nBut I'll split you quick\nGot hands like Jackie Chan, the way I switch my wrists and\nI make ya sick, but I'm a doctor, don't trip\nHopefully, in surgery, I won't slip\nOn a tile that file and twist ya lips\nLike Gomer Pyle\nPrescriptions I'm over-ripe\nFor the ones thats overbitin' on dental records\nBitin', to God, send your blessings\nI'll put your mask on, fast like Ramadan\nMix them bitches like half Lola Falana, half blonde in the paper, they named me\nA Large Professor, a Mad Scientist, with a long line of clients\n(BITCH!

an anesthetic breather\nIf you're not broke, I'll save your face like dope and make it right\nCasue being fake ain't tight\nYou need plastic surgery\n\n[Hook:]\nI hear the same ole rhymes, the same ole style\n(It seems you need plastic surgery) x5\n\n[Xzibit:]\nI'm located, at, the bottom of the black list\nI like to malpractice, complicate a surgery\nIntoxicated, smoke cigarettes, drop ashes in your open gases\nFeel the utensil, knife is dull like a pencil\nAnd what?\nWhen a nigga play pussy, get fucked\nWithout a kiss or a hug, I'm like contaminated blood\nTransfused from a junkie\nWith the heroin jones, I reconstruct the bones\nOf all hip hop clones\n\n[Ras Kass:]\nI date fat girls that weigh 215\nWith low self esteem, cause it's easier to get the pussy\nI'm performing vinyl liposuctions\n(Fat MC?)\nPhat production, motherfuckin' facial reconstruction\nNeedles injected 33 RPM of anesthetic for actors who require cosmetic\nSex changes from bitch niggas to rah-rah niggas\nThe only cure for sick lyrics is to implant a hit gimmick\n\n[Saafir:]\nThis shit is full blown, you better head to the clinic\nAfter Captain Save-A-Ho, we had the sex lieutenant\nOperate get straight, we here to separate the fake from the classic\nNiggas get blasted if they plastic\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Ras Kass:]\nI'm like Dougie Howser M.D with a desert eagle\nCriminal Genius\nOperation, separatin' them siamese twins hangin' beneath them niggas' penis\nTake it to your face like a skin graft\nRappers, I specialize in talent transplants\nYou want fat lips nurse get the collagen\nAnd ten tons of stomach pumps from all the cum you and Richard Gere be\nSwallowin'\nNow followin' ask Vanna to buy you vowels\nSo you can see I, aye, E-Swift, oh, you know why\nWe remain uncontested to the contender, we can\nMillion Man March all the way to December\nJanuary, Feburary 28th\n\n[Saafir:]\nI never wash my hands\nThe only rubber gloves I wear is on my dick\nBut I'll split you quick\nGot hands like Jackie Chan, the way I switch my wrists and\nI make ya sick, but I'm a doctor, don't trip\nHopefully, in surgery, I won't slip\nOn a tile that file and twist ya lips\nLike Gomer Pyle\nPrescriptions I'm over-ripe\nFor the ones thats overbitin' on dental records\nBitin', to God, send your blessings\nI'll put your mask on, fast like Ramadan\nMix them bitches like half Lola Falana, half blonde in the paper, they named me\nA Large Professor, a Mad Scientist, with a long line of clients\n(BITCH! GET OUT OF MY OFFICE)\nYou don't have an appointment or an application\nFor me to attack your face in my practice\nNever lackin' when I'm inserting these plastic patches\nSeems like you need plastic surgery"}}, {"title": "Heart of Man", "album": "Man vs Machine", "year": "2002-10-01", "lyrics": "[Xzibit]\nAin't a damn thing promised to ya\nExcept livin your life, and dyin one day, I'm just bein honest to ya\nIt take a whole lot, just to get a little\nGettin caught up in the middle the answer to life's riddles\nNever, come that easy, but it was easy\nTo lead me, but it wasn't easy to see me\nGet up off the block to the TV\nAnd sell a couple million CD's, best believe me\nYou see these callouses on my soul?\nCouldn't let hate and paralysis, take control\nI pick you up when you down 'til I can't no mo'\nMy name sting in your mouth like canker sores\nBeen at war my whole life, sleepless nights\nEndless fights, but still can't walk to the light\nCause my work ain't finished on earth, for what it's worth\nFrom the cradle to the hearse, God and family first, for real\n\n[Hook: singer]\nSomewhere in the heart of man (somewhere, within, somewhere)\nThere comes a time when he must understand (when he must understand)\nThe strong withstand, the weak will fall {*repeat*}\nCause tomorrow may not come at all {*repeat*}\n\n[Xzibit]\nLife ain't long, it's more like a snapshot\nYou can have the top, I live for the hop\nNever take a day I'm breathin on this planet for granted\nTime for change, time for growth, peace understandin\nSee but niggas keep forcin my hand, disturbin my plans\nBringin out the soldier in a peaceful man\nIt's like tryin to build a house on sand; you never get\nA solid foundation, one man can change the nation\nYo I put that on all creation; Haitian, Jamaican\nAfrican, Asian, Caucausian, Indian\nWhatever your persuasion, this is the message\nTime is of essence especially when you're countin your blessings\nLessons learned from the deepest of pain, it's not a game\nKeep my name outta your mouth and I'mma keep it the same, ya dig?\nIt's a shame, graduated to the rap game\nOnly to find out crack and rap was the same thang, damn!!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Xzibit]\nWho got skill?

One\nAlways be aware of your surroundings\nAnd peep all exits\nStay and move to the next shit\nRule Number Two\nLove no one that don't love you\nAnd if the shit come down\nThen you know your way around\nRule Number Three\nRealize it ain't about size\nOr havin' gats and guns\nBecause it only takes one\nHandle your business\nDon't let your business handle you\nIt's a lot of motherfuckers tryin' to do\nWhat you're doin' right here, right now\nSame color, same style\nTryin' to claim worldwide\nAnd ain't traveled but one mile\nIn these shoes, I paid dues\nWith nothin' to lose\nLive by the rhyme\nBut I'ma die by the booze\nXzibit breakin' down niggas\nWho got somethin' to prove\nHere we are face to face\nNigga make your move\nYou're in the wrong place\nBut at the right situation\nCause I was waitin\nHotter than Satan, never perpetratin\n\n[Chorus]\nI treat my enemies like friends\nSo I can reach out and touch\nLeave'em in the dust at the very end\nYou now tuned in to Hennessy and Gin\nIce cold Heinekens and down for whatever skins\nAnimosity you can reach out and touch\nHeavy right handed\nTeeth grind like a clutch\nAnd plus you ain't never had this much\nToo many friends too close\nYou might collapse from an overdose\n\n[Verse 2]\nI was raised to never follow after no man\nTo be my own man\nSo I can die by my own hand\nAnd never knowin' what the next day can bring\nSo I gotta make the ends\nJustify the means\nYo, I'm on the scene, here to do my own thing\nCan't never spend a lifetime\nChasin' after dreams\nI got the right shit\nFor all the wrong reasons\nAs long as I breathin'\nNiggas change like seasons\nNever trust a man\nWho can't look you in your eyes\nOnly the strong survive\nAnd that's word to the wise\nYo, when dead bodies get outlined in chalk\nEverybody should walk\nCause real killers don't talk\nI ain't really concerned\nHow many bridges you burned\nI extinguish your flame\nAnd take aim at your brain\nGivin' ligament pain\nTo have you walkin' with a cane\nWantin' money and fame\nYou got your fuckin' self to blame\nAnd that's West Coast rhyme\nWithout no gimmicks\nHere come Xzibit to break it down\nLike a chemic\nI'm spreadin' like an epidemic\nAnd all good things come to an end\nEnemies & Friends\n\n[Chorus]\nI treat my enemies like friends\nSo I can reach out and touch\nLeave'em in the dust at the very end\nYou now tuned in to Hennessy and Gin\nIce cold Heinekens and down for whatever skins\nAnimosity you can reach out and touch\nHeavy right handed\nTeeth grind like a clutch\nAnd plus you ain't never had this much\nToo many friends too close\nYou might collapse from an overdose\n\n[Verse 3]\nI don't give a fuck\nAbout the set you claim\nXzibit easily dispersed like crack cocaine\nSee I lent my shotgun to Kurt Cobain\nAnd the motherfucker never brought it back\nAhh, that's wack\nAs a matter of fact\nThis one nigga tried to jack\nMy squad had his ass\nOn the run like track\nNever knowin' who to trust\nIn this shit called rap\nHere to let you know\nMy sound surrounds like dat\nNever half step\nOr play the role like DeNiro\nY'all niggas wasn't down\nWhen we had less than zero\nFuck tryin' to be a hero\nTryin' to save some bitch\nMr. X to the Z\nNever play that shit\n\n[Chorus]\nI treat my enemies like friends\nSo I can reach out and touch\nLeave'em in the dust at the very end\nYou now tuned in to Hennessy and Gin\nIce cold Heinekens and down for whatever skins\nAnimosity you can reach out and touch\nHeavy right handed\nTeeth grind like a clutch\nAnd plus you ain't never had this much\nToo many friends too close\nYou might collapse from an overdose\n\n[Outro]\nYes, 1996, yes\nBringin' it live from the Westside\nThis is X to the Z\nThese niggas don't know\nThese niggas ain't ready\nYo, Mr. X to the Z\nFrom the Likwit Crew"}}, {"title": "Losin' Your Mind", "album": "Man vs Machine", "year": "2002-10-01", "lyrics": "[Xzibit (Snoop)]\nOut of a crowd, picking em out (and what?)\nDigging em out to

Canyon\nHead between ya knees, prepare for crash landing\nHand in mouf is not my style\nYou done, fucked up now but dont look down\nWe too, high up fo yo bricks to get to\nSee the skid marks from the

gonna be out of a job (and what?)\nRakim conversation with God (what?)\nI'm so hard with a quad in the prison yard\n\nMagic Johnson need to run for mayor\nLil Kim sold me some pussy, but I ain't pay her\nYou can, hate me now or hate me later\nI'm a instigator, (what?) a instigator\nIt's the, MVPs in SUVs\nWe don't, take no shit, take yo shit\nLeave a, hole in ya face size of the Grand Canyon\nHead between ya knees, prepare for crash landing\nHand in mouf is not my style\nYou done, fucked up now but dont look down\nWe too, high up fo yo bricks to get to\nSee the skid marks from the shit I've been through\nHow that sound?, smack me around\nLike the national death, nah it's not goin down\nSpeak ya mind but watch yo mouth\nYou make sense but no dollars, so that dont count (nigga!)\n\n[Hook 1 - Xzibit (Dr Dre)]\nWho wanna get involved with us?\nBreak down bitches, ball with us\nHit a couple of corners, crawl with us\nNo matter how you bust, you ain't hard as us\nIt's not, what you say, but how you spit it\nIt's not, what you got, but how you get it\nCome on, Golden State done finally did it\n(What made y'all think y'all could fuck wit Xzibit?)\n\n[Hook 2 - Snoop Dogg x2]\nLights, camera, action, show-time\nWe bust shit back in no time\nYo kind can't fuck with my kind\nYou must be losin' yo mind\n\n[Xzibit]\nLift off a mark, inhale exhaust\nCan never come off soft, I cover the cost\nGet lost in the sauce and the city niggas believe me\nPimping ain't easy, fat meat be greasy\nHoes can't walk right, pigs never fly straight\nWhat that West like, we rise like the birth rate\nFirst taste of the future, we all hands on\nAmputating Satan's last legs to stand on\nHead strong re-match, dollar for dollar, bullet for bullet\nNiggas dont want it, then dont pull it\nDont shoot it, mind polluted, deeply rooted\nCock back, ready to rock, time to do it\n\n[Hook 1 - Xzibit (Dr Dre)]\nWho wanna get involved with us?\nBreak down bitches, ball with us\nHit a couple of corners, crawl with us\nNo matter how you bust, you ain't hard as us\nIt's not, what you say, but how you spit it\nIt's not, what you got, but how you get it\nCome on, Golden State done finally did it\n(What made y'all think y'all could fuck with Xzibit?)\n\n[Xzibit (Snoop)]\nBack for more, watch me score (with what?)\nWith any whore that wanna explore (with what?)\nThe ups the downs, the ins the outs (then what?)\nKicking that ass, dick in your mouth (so what?)\nPiss on ya chest, and put it on tape (now what?)\nHave all these bitches calling it rape (and what?)\nSlicker than that, so pump your brakes (and what?)\nIndicte it, fight it, settle the case (w-w-w-w-what?)\n\n[Hook 1 - Xzibit (Dr Dre)]\nWho wanna get involved with us?\nBreak down bitches,ball with us\nHit a couple of corners,

yeah\n\n[Verse 1: Xzibit]\nIt was all a dream\nCame to California at seventeen\nLittle nigga tryna bubble up from the crack scene\nIt got so complicated, then I graduated\nHaters so mad I made it\nHow could I fly so high, only to feel so low?\nHow do they live so fast only to grow so slow?\nLike when you showing no support for your kids\nBut got money for marijuana just to smoke with your friends\nOr that woman who survives and beats cancer\nOnly to be drowned in debt with no answers\nThe frequency of tragedy, it happens so rapidly\nThat we became numb, we embraced this insanity\nSome wack-job haul off and smoke his whole family\nReality T.V. that's not based in reality\nStuck watching train wrecks, everybody going for self\nSelf worth is important but for money and wealth\nThis mentality of \"me, fuck everything else\"\nIt's a virus, a disease, I'm a victim myself\nBut I swear before I leave, I'mma fix it, I swear\nI'mma fix it, I swear, yo, you better beware\n\n[Verse 2: Xzibit]\nRich boy kill his own wife, knocks her teeth out\nCuts her fingers off, then escapes with a suicide\nThe king of pop died, Michael Vick was fighting dogs\nBut he walked and did his time, let him throw the fucking ball\nAs the markets keep crashing and people get desperate\nPutting faith in the false feeling so disrespected\nTurn to this record, the highest form of understanding\nUnderstand me, fight or flight for your family\nCome, walk with a soldier\nCome, talk with a soldier, yeah\nCinderblock stop shooting straight from the shoulder\nAs we all get older and hope falls over\nAnd damn, you were six years sober\nAnd just like that, now you back where you started, square one\nAnd you can't bring it back once that bullet leave the gun\nAs the planner gets smaller, prepare for the North American Union\nA (?) to replace your dollars\nNarcissistic society, love paparazzi\nGet to Starbucks for your overpriced latte\nIgnoring all the signs, \"nevermind\" is your mindstate\nUntil the end of time, shit is closer than you think man\n\n[Verse 3: Trick Trick]\nI done been in situations where the only thing that I could do was read the Bible\nWent in to the hill, child, with a sharpened piece of metal, the only way of survival\nMade up my mind that I don't ever wanna return, chance was given again\nNow I'm back out in the world, made a promise to God for living in sin\nI can never lie to God but it's so hard to live right\nI'm carrying seven-point-six-twos to fistfights\nAin't nobody playing fair, they cheat, no cheat\nI ain't fitting to be the topic of the preacher's eulogy speech\nThe word say, \"turn the other cheek\" that's what they teach us\nBut Peter sliced the ear of a nigga rolling on Jesus\nI don't want applause I'm doing what I'm supposed to do\nI'm a real nigga, one from a million, chosen few\nEverlasting pain has got my brain, it's like it's trapped inside a maze\nHave you been unfaithful to the game?\nDamn shame\nEighteen years, you never believed him\nThat's your son, go and see him, motherfucker\nYou fucked his mother\nThe goddamn common courtesy never applied to you\n'Cause you thought she lied to you\nYou couldn't see your own mother in his face\nIf you die, he'll be in a better place, bring the tape back", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fce1e2b08952b1596484d7ea9ce00db2.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist":

"[Intro: Xzibit]\nYeah, the first night I spent in California\nI was homeless on Venice Beach, yeah\n\n[Verse 1: Xzibit]\nIt was all a dream\nCame to California at seventeen\nLittle nigga tryna bubble up from the crack scene\nIt got so complicated, then I graduated\nHaters so mad I made it\nHow could I fly so high, only to feel so low?\nHow do they live so fast only to grow so slow?\nLike when you showing no support for your kids\nBut got money for marijuana just to smoke with your friends\nOr that woman who survives and beats cancer\nOnly to be drowned in debt with no answers\nThe frequency of tragedy, it happens so rapidly\nThat we became numb, we embraced this insanity\nSome wack-job haul off and smoke his whole family\nReality T.V. that's not based in reality\nStuck watching train wrecks, everybody going for self\nSelf worth is important but for money and wealth\nThis mentality of \"me, fuck everything else\"\nIt's a virus, a disease, I'm a victim myself\nBut I swear before I leave, I'mma fix it, I swear\nI'mma fix it, I swear, yo, you better beware\n\n[Verse 2: Xzibit]\nRich boy kill his own wife, knocks her teeth out\nCuts her fingers off, then escapes with a suicide\nThe king of pop died, Michael Vick was fighting dogs\nBut he walked and did his time, let him throw the fucking ball\nAs the markets keep crashing and people get desperate\nPutting faith in the false feeling so disrespected\nTurn to this record, the highest form of understanding\nUnderstand me, fight or flight for your family\nCome, walk with a soldier\nCome, talk with a soldier, yeah\nCinderblock stop shooting straight from the shoulder\nAs we all get older and hope falls over\nAnd damn, you were six years sober\nAnd just like that, now you back where you started, square one\nAnd you can't bring it back once that bullet leave the gun\nAs the planner gets smaller, prepare for the North American Union\nA (?) to replace your dollars\nNarcissistic society, love paparazzi\nGet to Starbucks for your overpriced latte\nIgnoring all the signs, \"nevermind\" is your mindstate\nUntil the end of time, shit is closer than you think man\n\n[Verse 3: Trick Trick]\nI done been in situations where the only thing that I could do was read the Bible\nWent in to the hill, child, with a sharpened piece of metal, the only way of survival\nMade up my mind that I don't ever wanna return, chance was given again\nNow I'm back out in the world, made a promise to God for living in sin\nI can never lie to God but it's so hard to live right\nI'm carrying seven-point-six-twos to fistfights\nAin't nobody playing fair, they cheat, no cheat\nI ain't fitting to be the topic of the preacher's eulogy speech\nThe word say, \"turn the other cheek\" that's what they teach us\nBut Peter sliced the ear of a nigga rolling on Jesus\nI don't want applause I'm doing what I'm supposed to do\nI'm a real nigga, one from a million, chosen few\nEverlasting pain has got my brain, it's like it's trapped inside a maze\nHave you been unfaithful to the game?\nDamn shame\nEighteen years, you never believed him\nThat's your son, go and see him, motherfucker\nYou fucked his mother\nThe goddamn common courtesy never applied to you\n'Cause you thought she lied to you\nYou couldn't see your own mother in his face\nIf you die, he'll be in a better place, bring the tape back"}}, {"title": "Symphony in X Major", "album": "Man vs Machine", "year": "2002-10-01", "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Xzibit]\nTime to snap out of it, welcome to the real world\nMy life like a Hitchcock

New millenium\n\n[Verse 3: Xzibit]\nI was one that never begged for nothin\nMe and my homies build penitentiary huffin\nRunnin your mouth like a bitch cause you all on my dick\nWhat is he Dogg Pound now? Is he still with Tha Liks?\nIs he rich? Is Xzibit a Crip?\nThis is business stay the fuck out of my family shit, heh\nA grown man, the back of my hand is what you receive\nThe X-Files make you believe\nYou check the Soundscan and do the math\nMe and my staff run a worldwide warpath\nA bloodbath make Xzibit have a good laugh\nIt's goin down, hit the ground like a plane crash\nYou lil' fags ain't prepared for the X-Man, scared and desperate\nYoung and restless, there is no guest list\nMove to the back of the line, yo it's my time\nPrime time only where the beats and the rhyme shine\n\n[Hook: Xzibit] 2X\nCrack a bottle for your hard time\nIt's dedicated to my soldiers on the front line\nThis one's for all of us\nThinkin bout your casualties\nLearn from mistakes, protect your family\nCause it's the year 2000"}}, {"title":

jump when he said and that ass got cracked\nPhysical contact was in form of a slap\nAt the age of fifteen Xzibit now hit back\nCourtesy of my stepbrother, who taught me to scrap\nLeft the bitch on the ground with her eyes on black\nRan away from the house of Teresa and Nate\nInto juvenile detention where I built up hate\nI don't remember the date of the judicial debate\nBut legally I was now in custody of the state\n\nChorus:\n\nAnd niggas wonder why I sit up in the club and drink\nSay what's up to Xzibit and I still don't speak\nTryina contemplate the next move to make\nGotta find some way

that\n[I'm tellin' you it's poppin' man come home]\nAlright, in a minute\n\nVerse Two:\n\nAnd that was worse than the treatment I was gettin' at home\nOnly now I was fucked up plus all alone\nMy father talkin' all crazy to me over the phone\nTurned age sixteen now on my own\nStarted running with cats who carried gats cause they had too\nWith no hesitation lock load then blast you\nWithout a

favorite things!\nBut I ain't Mary so ain't a damn thing poppin\nOnly death disease and a whole lota palm trees\nNot only for mics, Xzibit is a way of life\nUntil my death so I celebrate success\nBest of the best wouldn't test these waters with a yacht\nSendin' sixteen shots across your parking lot\nAll up on your proximity drinking Hennessy\nHoldin down ground like the Statute of Liberty\nSo nobody ever can rush my spot\nAnd the torch stay lit so I ain't worried about shit\nIt ain't where you're from it's all about how you represent!\nUnfamiliar faces better know who your fuckin'

piece go twice to make sure you see the light\nPlus I'm dreaded not by the locks but by the cops\nAnd flocks of females that only think with their crotch\nUnlimited smoke\nThe bonified cut throat Columbian necktie\nNow don't you look fly\nI'll leave you there to be discovered by your mother\nOr maybe your brother or your boty boy lover\nNo matter your background Xzibit never backs down\nBe

record\nBut it's not\nSo I testify to the fact\nChronic mixed with the Yak make a hellified contact\nIt makes it real easy to trip\nUnload the whole clip on your block then split!\nAin't no answers to the test you taking\nNever move fakin'\nCan't be shaken'\nFrom my solid foundation like this\n\n[Chorus]\nEyes may shine, Teeth may grit\nAnd all of that shit\nAnd you still won't step\nSo what's

preserve life cause the vest wasn\u2019t thick enough\nTeflon, Napalm, Homicide scenes\nThese are a few of my favorite things!\nBut I ain't Mary so ain't a damn thing poppin\nOnly death disease and a whole lota palm trees\nNot only for mics, Xzibit is a way of life\nUntil my death so I celebrate success\nBest of the best wouldn't test these waters with a yacht\nSendin' sixteen shots across your parking lot\nAll up on your proximity drinking Hennessy\nHoldin down ground like the Statute of Liberty\nSo nobody ever can rush my spot\nAnd the torch stay lit so I ain't worried about shit\nIt ain't where you're from it's all about how you represent!\nUnfamiliar faces better know who your fuckin' with\n\n[Chorus]\nEyes may shine, Teeth may grit\nAnd all of that shit\nAnd you still won't step\nSo what's next?\nAll of a sudden you ain't sayin nothin\n[You Better off buckin yourself]\n[You need to stop frontin]\nEyes may shine, Teeth may grit\nAnd all of that shit\nAnd you still won't step\nSo what's next?\nAll of a sudden you ain't sayin nothin\n[You Better off buckin yourself]\n[You need to stop frontin]\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm only comin' through when it's time for collection\nXzibit forever nasty, spread like infection\nAin't no protection ever made by man to withstand this punishment\nIn other words runnin' shit\nKeep your eyes wide cause the style gets darker\nI make papers and see more new cars than Bob Barker\nCause if the price ain't right then it's time to take flight\nLet the piece go twice to make sure you see the light\nPlus I'm dreaded not by the locks but by the cops\nAnd flocks of females that only think with their crotch\nUnlimited smoke\nThe bonified cut throat Columbian necktie\nNow don't you look fly\nI'll leave you there to be discovered by your mother\nOr maybe your brother or your boty boy lover\nNo matter your background Xzibit never backs down\nBe prepared for static and semi-automatics in your grill\n\n[Chorus]\nEyes may shine, Teeth may grit\nAnd all of that shit\nAnd you still won't step\nSo what's next?\nAll of a sudden you ain't sayin nothin\n[You Better off buckin yourself]\n[You need to stop frontin]\nEyes may shine, Teeth may grit\nAnd all of that shit\nAnd you still won't step\nSo what's next?\nAll of a sudden you ain't sayin nothin\n[You Better off buckin yourself]\n[You need to stop frontin]\n\n[Verse 3]\nEverything that come around go 3.6.0\nLongitude and latitude\nIt's alll in the attitude\nI'm in the mood to put a twist on things\nXzibit here to rock the planet 'till the fat bitch sings\nThe shit is closer than you think\nDon't blink it might be over in a matter of seconds\nI'd like to say this off the record\nBut it's not\nSo I testify to the fact\nChronic mixed with the Yak make a hellified contact\nIt makes it real easy to trip\nUnload the whole clip on your block then split!\nAin't no answers to the test you taking\nNever move fakin'\nCan't be shaken'\nFrom my solid foundation like this\n\n[Chorus]\nEyes may shine, Teeth may grit\nAnd all of that shit\nAnd you still won't step\nSo what's next?\nAll of a sudden you ain't sayin nothin\n[You Better off buckin yourself]\n[You need to stop frontin]\nEyes may shine, Teeth may grit\nAnd all of that shit\nAnd you still won't step\nSo what's next?\nAll of a sudden you ain't sayin nothin\n[You Better off buckin yourself]\n[You need to stop frontin]"}}, {"title": "Been a Long Time", "album": "Restless", "year": "2000-12-12", "lyrics": "[Saafir as radio host]\nRrrah, uhh, bitch!\nIt's radio radio station, cat Xzibit

this..\n\n[Verse 1: Xzibit]\n{*BZZT*} Bounce up out of the house close to midnight\nFull rack up in the back {*BZZ BZZ*} shit is tight\nFull charge and I'm out for somethin\nMass production, Battlecat bang percussion\nEnd of discussion, hittin some corners, rearrange thangs\nAnd brang change, we expand California\nListen - I lost more than I can ever gain back\nFrom this road to riches, makin my heart turn black\nSo I'm cold to bitches, and I never call back\nPlus I'm stoned and vicious, lay your whole hood flat\nGet your, shit together nigga Big Snoop Dogg told me\n'Do music and leave that other shit alone homey'\nWe came from dust, the X-odus, the hard to touch\nY'all niggas ain't fuckin with us, and plus\nIt ain't nothin like standin on your own two\nSo run them streets, but never let 'em run you\n\n[Hook: Nate Dogg]\nTime is steady wastin, steady wastin\nSince time won't wait for me, yeah, won't wait, won't wait\nJust give me a beat that's bang, give me a beat that's bangin\nI'll bust 'til I'm deceased, yeah, wooo-oooh, ooh-ooh-ooooh\n\n[Verse 2: Xzibit]\nTune in, witness the rise of a icon\nThe python wrap around 'til your breath gone\nThe upper echelon, and I'm the cat you pull a weapon on\nAnd wanna squeeze 'til my life is gone?\nBack to the wall and trust nobody\nSippin Cognac with Kurupt, Young Gotti\nSomebody gotta recognize this\nThrow fo' fingers up, add a thumb, then make it a fist\nNumber one draft pick, lead the league in assists\nGive a fuck how you decorate your neck and your wrists\nYou just settin yourself up for the twist (gimme that) it's like this\nOnly a few slide through like the Schindler's List\nWho's the bitch, who's the mack, what's worse\nThe niggas that bring in the coke or smoke the crack?\nMetaphor figure four let it break your back (yeah)\nIt's been a long time, where the gangstas at?\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Xzibit]\nDamn it feels good to be back in the saddle\nOn top of the game, crackin the frame, the heat of the battle\nBeen a long time comin but we waited\nXzibit went from bein hated, to makin the whole world say it\nGive a fuck if the radio play it\nNiggas fall like the domino effect and you can't delay it\nIt ain't about who you are when you're makin your stack\nIt's the look that's on your face when you givin it back\nSo picture that\n\n[Nate Dogg]\nTime, keeps on slippin, slippin.. keeps on slippin away.. mm-hmm\nMy

that knock you off of this Earth\nStand up, let yourself be heard\nI ain't hear one word\nI'm just bringing what the crowd deserve\nCause what you want, man, that's what we got\nOnce things begin, my nigga, it won't stop\nLock down your blocks, let's flood the streets\nNow welcome to the world of Mr. X-to-the-Z\n\n[Verse 1: Xzibit]\nMotherfucker, I'm back with a vengeance\nBack with the business, I'm a vet with a pension\nA man with a vision, I'm a man on a mission\nSo crowd around, listen\nThis that hardcore heavy head bang, you've been missing\nGo to DEFCON 1 if you don't comply\nI might explode like a meth lab, there is no rehab\nBitches need knee pads, a pound and some Zig Zags\nThat last like Etta James, I'm back, let the cage rap\nCharles Bronson, visionary marksman\nHeartless, leave your intellect on your carpet\nI don't really start shit, I just like to finish it\nDismember with a hacksaw, get rid of it\nI'm so militant, you so Gilligan, killing it\nHeard you want the coast on your back\nYo, be careful what you wish for, good luck with that\nYou could be found in your trunk with your chest collapsed, relax\n\n[Hook: Xzibit]\n\n[Verse 2: Xzibit]\nMotherfucker, I'm made for the masses\nChromed out classics, block after block\nWhen I park, so Jurassic\nCameras start flashing, everybody asking\nHarassing, suck my dick with six aspirins\nThat'll keep your head tight, back from the afterlife\nLocked in my hurt locker, built up my appetite\nYou need your name in lights, when I just need a mic\nAnd I can level any playing field like a sheet of ice\nIt's going down like when you cuffed and they read your rights\nI'm going higher, better bail if you're afraid of heights\nI'm ritual killing, prepare for a sacrifice\nRoll her like a pair of dice, lounging in paradise\nJealous niggas want to feed, like a parasite\nBurn leeches off with cigarettes, I just need a light\nI been around, seen the press get it shut down\nI'm stadium status, the crowd gotta move

right, you dig?\nCome on, yeah\n\n[Hook: Xzibit]\nWelcome to my world of hurt\nWhere I put in work\nI got guns that knock you off of this Earth\nStand up, let yourself be heard\nI ain't hear one word\nI'm just bringing what the crowd deserve\nCause what you want, man, that's what we got\nOnce things begin, my nigga, it won't stop\nLock down your blocks, let's flood the streets\nNow welcome to the world of Mr. X-to-the-Z\n\n[Verse 1: Xzibit]\nMotherfucker, I'm back with a vengeance\nBack with the business, I'm a vet with a pension\nA man with a vision, I'm a man on a mission\nSo crowd around, listen\nThis that hardcore heavy head bang, you've been missing\nGo to DEFCON 1 if you don't comply\nI might explode like a meth lab, there is no rehab\nBitches need knee pads, a pound and some Zig Zags\nThat last like Etta James, I'm back, let the cage rap\nCharles Bronson, visionary marksman\nHeartless, leave your intellect on your carpet\nI don't really start shit, I just like to finish it\nDismember with a hacksaw, get rid of it\nI'm so militant, you so Gilligan, killing it\nHeard you want the coast on your back\nYo, be careful what you wish for, good luck with that\nYou could be found in your trunk with your chest collapsed, relax\n\n[Hook: Xzibit]\n\n[Verse 2: Xzibit]\nMotherfucker, I'm made for the masses\nChromed out classics, block after block\nWhen I park, so Jurassic\nCameras start flashing, everybody asking\nHarassing, suck my dick with six aspirins\nThat'll keep your head tight, back from the afterlife\nLocked in my hurt locker, built up my appetite\nYou need your name in lights, when I just need a mic\nAnd I can level any playing field like a sheet of ice\nIt's going down like when you cuffed and they read your rights\nI'm going higher, better bail if you're afraid of heights\nI'm ritual killing, prepare for a sacrifice\nRoll her like a pair of dice, lounging in paradise\nJealous niggas want to feed, like a parasite\nBurn leeches off with cigarettes, I just need a light\nI been around, seen the press get it shut down\nI'm stadium status, the crowd gotta move now\n\n[Hook: Xzibit]\n\n[Scratches: DJ Skee]\n\n[Verse 3: Xzibit]\nA man dies once, a coward dies a thousand times\nYour bitch ass is on nine hundred and ninety-nine\nYou only got one more, you better make it last\nBefore I lay this hurt locker to your fucking ass\nLock chop choppers, chop shop droppers\nFresh state to state until the feds came knocking\nCall us in the clutch when your shows ain't popping\nWhen your hoes ain't dropping, when your flows ain't rocking\n\n[Hook: Xzibit]"}}, {"title": "Killer's Remorse", "album": "Napalm", "year": "2012-10-09", "lyrics": "[Hook: Xzibit]\nI'm sorry I met you\nI'm sorry I hurt you\nI'm sorry I killed you\nI'm sorry I murked you\nBecause I'm all alone now nobody is with me\nNobody to threaten that they about come get me\nI wish I could go back to where we began\nI wish you was alive so I could kill you again\nI wish we had more paths to cross\nNobody even cares if they survive my loss\nMy killer's remorse\n\n[Verse 1: Bishop Lamont]\nIts funny how the same shit we laugh at\nCould be the very same shit to get your bitch ass clacked\nYour throat slit next now drown in your own pool out back\nI kick the cats and dog too but shit I don't count that\nI'm the Angel of Death I strangle till there's no breath\nI kill the kill kill till there ain't nobody left\nMy conscience don't inhibit me I kill deliberately\nJust wanna be like God, cause God kills indiscriminately\nI'm so Christian I'm so Muslim\nSuicide bomb your mom crib if you push em\nI'm parallel to Hell I'm ready so Satan what's cooking?\nAnd rappers running their mouth\nThey don't know how close their bitch ass is coked\nTo get turned in ghosts nigga I will kill you\nDon't get it cross memories fade just as blood washes off\nI said memories fade just as blood washes off\nHope to see you soon\n\n[Hook: Xzibit]\nI'm sorry I

where we began\nI wish you was alive so I could kill you again\nI wish we had more paths to cross\nNobody even cares if they survive my loss\nMy killer's remorse\n\n[Verse 2: B-Real]\nI feel so guilty my hands are filthy\nFrom decorating your face all over the building\nI'll say it sincere if I ain't making it clear\nI'm writing on the wall with your blood man I wished you were here\nBut you moved on at your funeral I beat you with slam\nI hugged your mom tell your sister and her kids to be calm\nI won't tell 'em you gone you just sleep in a dream and all c'est la vie\nWe smoked you like the weed in the bong\n\n[Verse 3: Demrick]\nYeah, have you ever seen the bloodstain\nAnd know that person has returned from where he once came?\nRegret is such an ugly thing only if you let it fuck with your brain\nBut it ain't gonna change a fucking thing\nWhat's done is done chalk that shit up to the game\nYou're still dead when I'm still alive\nAnd I never got the chance to utilize my best alibi\n\n[Hook: Xzibit]\n\n[Verse 4: Xzibit]\nStarted the bullshit escalated to violence\nIn result of the violence infinite permanent silence\nNow I feel empty not even existing\nMy worst enemy is no longer against me\nI remember the hatred and how it consumed me\nAnd you felt the same thing but never could move me\nA shot to the face is nothing like in the movies\nThe back of your brain is out the body keeps moving\nSo I should rejoice now because you are past tense\nThe last of my enemies the last of you bastards\nThe dirt on your casket\nNow I'm so alone now you was my reason to carry my gauge or chrome out\nSo now I just zone out and wait for the contact\nAnd life for the combat and now we beyond that\nAnd I'd take it all back if I knew what I knew now\nWhat's a shooter without somebody to shoot down?\n\n[Hook: Xzibit]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/727e047579481405310e18c83d10416c.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Xzibit", "raw": {"annotation_count": 3, "api_path":

murked you\nBecause I'm all alone now nobody is with me\nNobody to threaten that they about come get me\nI wish I could go back to where we began\nI wish you was alive so I could kill you again\nI wish we had more paths to cross\nNobody even cares if they survive my loss\nMy killer's remorse\n\n[Verse 1: Bishop Lamont]\nIts funny how the same shit we laugh at\nCould be the very same shit to get your bitch ass clacked\nYour throat slit next now drown in your own pool out back\nI kick the cats and dog too but shit I don't count that\nI'm the Angel of Death I strangle till there's no breath\nI kill the kill kill till there ain't nobody left\nMy conscience don't inhibit me I kill deliberately\nJust wanna be like God, cause God kills indiscriminately\nI'm so Christian I'm so Muslim\nSuicide bomb your mom crib if you push em\nI'm parallel to Hell I'm ready so Satan what's cooking?\nAnd rappers running their mouth\nThey don't know how close their bitch ass is coked\nTo get turned in ghosts nigga I will kill you\nDon't get it cross memories fade just as blood washes off\nI said memories fade just as blood washes off\nHope to see you soon\n\n[Hook: Xzibit]\nI'm sorry I met you\nI'm sorry I hurt you\nI'm sorry I killed you\nI'm sorry I murked you\nBecause I'm all alone now nobody is with me\nNobody to threaten that they about come get me\nI wish I could go back to where we began\nI wish you was alive so I could kill you again\nI wish we had more paths to cross\nNobody even cares if they survive my loss\nMy killer's remorse\n\n[Verse 2: B-Real]\nI feel so guilty my hands are filthy\nFrom decorating your face all over the building\nI'll say it sincere if I ain't making it clear\nI'm writing on the wall with your blood man I wished you were here\nBut you moved on at your funeral I beat you with slam\nI hugged your mom tell your sister and her kids to be calm\nI won't tell 'em you gone you just sleep in a dream and all c'est la vie\nWe smoked you like the weed in the bong\n\n[Verse 3: Demrick]\nYeah, have you ever seen the bloodstain\nAnd know that person has returned from where he once came?\nRegret is such an ugly thing only if you let it fuck with your brain\nBut it ain't gonna change a fucking thing\nWhat's done is done chalk that shit up to the game\nYou're still dead when I'm still alive\nAnd I never got the chance to utilize my best alibi\n\n[Hook: Xzibit]\n\n[Verse 4: Xzibit]\nStarted the bullshit escalated to violence\nIn result of the violence infinite permanent silence\nNow I feel empty not even existing\nMy worst enemy is no longer against me\nI remember the hatred and how it consumed me\nAnd you felt the same thing but never could move me\nA shot to the face is nothing like in the movies\nThe back of your brain is out the body keeps moving\nSo I should rejoice now because you are past tense\nThe last of my enemies the last of you bastards\nThe dirt on your casket\nNow I'm so alone now you was my reason to carry my gauge or chrome out\nSo now I just zone out and wait for the contact\nAnd life for the combat and now we beyond that\nAnd I'd take it all back if I knew what I knew now\nWhat's a shooter without somebody to shoot down?\n\n[Hook: Xzibit]"}}, {"title": "Enjoy The Night", "album": "Napalm", "year": "2012-10-09", "lyrics": "[Hook: Brevi]\nWe gon' get fucked up\nEnjoy the night, enjoy the night\nWe gon' get fucked up\nAnd that's alright, that's alright\nRaised in the gutter, I'm a find a way\nEverything is ok\nBaby lift your cup up\nEnjoy the night, enjoy the night\n\n[Verse 1: Xzibit]\nAmsterdam to Tokyo longitude only I can know\nLatitude is my attitude fall in place like a domino\nI ain't come here to make no friends\nBecause I rather be feared than love\nScared to death that I move this mountain get to you with this shotgun slug\nAnd I could never turn my back on the ways of life\nI'm sparing no expense top down Vegas lights\nMy flows they verge in tide I do not give a fuck\nIt's about to jump tonight my crib is filling up\nIs filling up, is filling up full of bitches I have never met\nAnd they ain't left like these bitches here on house arrest\nLine out two shots and I'm down six dark or light, but that shit don't mix\nGot a body bag full of pills and shit\nLet's see how fucked up we all gon' get\n\n[Hook: Brevi]\n\n[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]\nRaised in the gutter bread getting butter\nFace like her mother ass like she's southern\nSo much cash I just gotta laugh\nOut in Paris smoking grass signing autographs\nIt's apparent if it's foreign and I'm starring\nIf it's shining then I'm near it\nIt's designer then I wear it, uh\nLook at these diamonds spend some time on my appearance\nYou too busy saving hoes you ain't gonna find a dime on clearance\nYou know me bitch I get straight down to the point\nPop another bottle roll another joint\nAnd all of my niggas OG's and all of that smoke is OG\nI'm way too high to be low key\nBetter act like you know me\n\n[Hook: Brevi]\n\n[Verse 3: David Banner]\nGirl if you wanna get some drunk dick you can come and get it from me\nI know I shouldn't mix all this vodka with this hennessey\nBut we gon' get fucked up then pour it up drink big\nParty like it's 99 put a one-nine before that bitch\nWe gon' sip until we get sick, we gon' blaze till we get licked\nCall Earl the world spinning tell the lil' bitch ye we winning\nThe girl that you love is good in the beginning\nTwo good shots and now the girl sinnin'\nSpinning over now I'm sober face breasts\nMore Mer'\nLine out two shots and I'm down six darker

ok\nBaby lift your cup up\nEnjoy the night, enjoy the night\n\n[Verse 1: Xzibit]\nAmsterdam to Tokyo longitude only I can know\nLatitude is my attitude fall in place like a domino\nI ain't come here to make no friends\nBecause I rather be feared than love\nScared to death that I move this mountain get to you with this shotgun slug\nAnd I could never turn my back on the ways of life\nI'm sparing no expense top down Vegas lights\nMy flows they verge in tide I do not give a fuck\nIt's about to jump tonight my crib is filling up\nIs filling up, is filling up full of bitches I have never met\nAnd they ain't left like these bitches here on house arrest\nLine out two shots and I'm down six dark or light, but that shit don't mix\nGot a body bag full of pills and shit\nLet's see how fucked up we all gon' get\n\n[Hook: Brevi]\n\n[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]\nRaised in the gutter bread getting butter\nFace like her mother ass like she's southern\nSo much cash I just gotta laugh\nOut in Paris smoking grass signing autographs\nIt's apparent if it's foreign and I'm starring\nIf it's shining then I'm near it\nIt's designer then I wear it, uh\nLook at these diamonds spend some time on my appearance\nYou too busy saving hoes you ain't gonna find a dime on clearance\nYou know me bitch I get straight down to the point\nPop another bottle roll another joint\nAnd all of my niggas OG's and all of that smoke is OG\nI'm way too high to be low key\nBetter act like you know me\n\n[Hook: Brevi]\n\n[Verse 3: David Banner]\nGirl if you wanna get some drunk dick you can come and get it from me\nI know I shouldn't mix all this vodka with this hennessey\nBut we gon' get fucked up then pour it up drink big\nParty like it's 99 put a one-nine before that bitch\nWe gon' sip until we get sick, we gon' blaze till we get licked\nCall Earl the world spinning tell the lil' bitch ye we winning\nThe girl that you love is good in the beginning\nTwo good shots and now the girl sinnin'\nSpinning over now I'm sober face breasts\nMore Mer'\nLine out two shots and I'm down six darker light but that shit don't mix\nGot a body bag full of pills and shit let's see how fucked up we all gon' get\n\n[Hook: Brevi]"}}, {"title": "Shroomz", "album": "40 Days & 40 Nightz", "year": "1998-08-25", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIt's a long day Friday\nIt's like movin' all this weight\nGot Xzibit up tight,

me O.E. and three blunts\nNo, make it four\nAnything else? (Vitamin C pills and orange juice)\nWhat are you drinking, gin? (Nah dude, it's the shroomz)\nThe shroomz? (What?)\nYeah, that's some other shit\nOne of the reasons why George Clinton sees the mothership\nHow high it make you get?\nFucked up?\nThrowing up guts?\nOr do it have you stuck with soft dick and can't fuck?\nHold up\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow chew 'em up and slam the orange juice\nVitamin C chase\nKill the taste\nYou can tell it's nasty by the look on my face\nDon't get it twisted like a nigga coked up\nAnd druggied down\nSee cannibus and mushrooms be coming from the ground\nAll natural\nPost it at the club\nLooking funny-style\nTight slack\nPimp feather hat\nWhere the bitches at?\nWe giving orders at the bar holding money\nWhen all of a sudden\nAll the people started looking funny\nAnd started lookin runny\nAnd liquify\nRight before my very eye\nThis a different kind of high\n(Ohh shit, you see this shit\nThese motherfuckers melting and shit...)\n\n[Verse 3]\nNiggas and bitches walkin' by that I recognize\nFeeling hypnotized\nPupils dialated, changing size\nThat's when I heard the battle cries from across the room\nSet these crooked niggas straight\nLikwit Crew, activate\nForm of, a bunch of wild niggas mashing you\nCame crashing through\nElbows and right hooks for you\nWe got thrown out by this time\nMy shit is blown out\nPull the phone out\nAccelleration and we bone out\nIn the zone out beyond\nCaptain Kurk and Klingon\nShit that I'm on\nBe high powered like a Yukon\nBack to my house, fucked up\nTrying to see straight\nHow much of that bullshit did I actually take?\n(2 grams dude)\nGod damn, no wonder why I feel like a underneath\nTold the white boy \"Faggot, we got beef.\"\nOver did it holmes\nNiggas playin' bones in the living room\nRestless, try to find anything to mess with\nWhere my keys at?\nPickin up clothes, trying to fold the shit\nSee my riot gage on the wall, better unload the shit\nFucked up niggas and firearms dont mix right\nCocked back the chamber, dumping shells 'til it felt light\nThought I dumped the all, Counted 7\nBut it was 8, straight gone\nPoint the barrel at the floor, let it go\n\n[Outro]\nFuck!

right\nPartner came through with two white boys (Duuude)\nTalkin' noise bout a hot spot\nWhere bitches come alone\nAnd niggas don't cock block\nLet the top drop\nAnd we out\nHit the liquor store\nGive me O.E. and three blunts\nNo, make it four\nAnything else? (Vitamin C pills and orange juice)\nWhat are you drinking, gin? (Nah dude, it's the shroomz)\nThe shroomz? (What?)\nYeah, that's some other shit\nOne of the reasons why George Clinton sees the mothership\nHow high it make you get?\nFucked up?\nThrowing up guts?\nOr do it have you stuck with soft dick and can't fuck?\nHold up\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow chew 'em up and slam the orange juice\nVitamin C chase\nKill the taste\nYou can tell it's nasty by the look on my face\nDon't get it twisted like a nigga coked up\nAnd druggied down\nSee cannibus and mushrooms be coming from the ground\nAll natural\nPost it at the club\nLooking funny-style\nTight slack\nPimp feather hat\nWhere the bitches at?\nWe giving orders at the bar holding money\nWhen all of a sudden\nAll the people started looking funny\nAnd started lookin runny\nAnd liquify\nRight before my very eye\nThis a different kind of high\n(Ohh shit, you see this shit\nThese motherfuckers melting and shit...)\n\n[Verse 3]\nNiggas and bitches walkin' by that I recognize\nFeeling hypnotized\nPupils dialated, changing size\nThat's when I heard the battle cries from across the room\nSet these crooked niggas straight\nLikwit Crew, activate\nForm of, a bunch of wild niggas mashing you\nCame crashing through\nElbows and right hooks for you\nWe got thrown out by this time\nMy shit is blown out\nPull the phone out\nAccelleration and we bone out\nIn the zone out beyond\nCaptain Kurk and Klingon\nShit that I'm on\nBe high powered like a Yukon\nBack to my house, fucked up\nTrying to see straight\nHow much of that bullshit did I actually take?\n(2 grams dude)\nGod damn, no wonder why I feel like a underneath\nTold the white boy \"Faggot, we got beef.\"\nOver did it holmes\nNiggas playin' bones in the living room\nRestless, try to find anything to mess with\nWhere my keys at?\nPickin up clothes, trying to fold the shit\nSee my riot gage on the wall, better unload the shit\nFucked up niggas and firearms dont mix right\nCocked back the chamber, dumping shells 'til it felt light\nThought I dumped the all, Counted 7\nBut it was 8, straight gone\nPoint the barrel at the floor, let it go\n\n[Outro]\nFuck! Shit!...Wooow...Ay, ay, ay, It's cool, I just shot the floor man\nIt's all good, it's all good...Ay, ay, where everybody at?

that's the breaks, the highs and lows of the industry\nD.I.T.C. and X to the Z\nGet it crackin' to the third degree\nXzibit breakin' niggas down like H.I.V\nWe bring rap to your city like B.E.T\nBut still feel California is the place to be, catastrophe\n\n[Verse 2: Tash]\nThe Alkaholiks is back to fry you extra crispy\nWith the skills that make the plots to try and diss me extra risky\nCause the time it takes to infiltrate and stop my forward motion\nCalifornia will have broken off and fell into the ocean\nCause I rocked around the world with my ill type skill\nStep for real or I'll leave your grill scarred like Seal\nCause I regulate the sectin where the drinks is getting blended\nCertified bartender, go catch the 40 when I send it your way\n\n[Verse 3: Xzibit]\nNiggas that hustle till the day light break\nGo to county 20 times, till can't go straight\nDon't nothing in the motherfucking world come free\nI'll never see a nine to five cause it just ain't me\n(It's like this)\nXzibit shall hustle, lift, build muscle\nAnd think like Russell\nSurvive and bring it live and direct\nTo any crowd throughout the world like this\nCome home and smoke a spliff in the Benz with Swift\n\n[Chorus: Xzibit, J-Ro & Hurricane G]\nI'm fucked up, J-Ro\nYeah, I'm fucked up too\nLooking at these bitches from a bird's eye view\nMy name is J-Ro from the Likwit Crew\nSo what nigga is it you wanna do?\n\n[Verse 4: J-Ro]\nMy flow is metaphorical, historically correct\nWhat do you expect from a nigga with my intellect?\nEast coast representing West coast gangsta\nNah, I ain't tripping, I call up King Tee, we go dipping\nThrough the streets pumping hardcore Likwit beats\nFlowing air, blowing, lounging in them leather seats\nThinking back how we used to rock the house party\nNow we just fucking it up for everybody\n\n[Verse 5: Xzibit]\nHow dare you try to compare yourself to the original\nProfessional Xzibit break you down like correctional facility's\nLimit all capabilities, motherfuck MC's\nHard to read like Japanese\nI'm spreading like disease so I can't be stopped\nBy who you run with, your clique or the bitch ass cops\nXzibit\u2019s first LP, it hit your block like crack rock\nI\u2019m blowing up your spot by remote, it's the cutthroat\n\n[Verse 6: J-Ro]\nI\"m from Cristal-ifornia, I warned ya I'd be on ya\nI'm off the paint like velvet paintings, make your mama mourn ya\nThe Ro is outer national, cold as Henne-sota\nI smoke 12 MC's a day just to fill my quota\nFrom Fourty Ohio all the way to Ore-gin\nBuddy, my fingers are bloody, now I'm Washing-ten\nI clown

is badder than the water down in Mexico\nCause RICO blend styles like juice and gin\nI got the Likwit shit that have you seeing double like the Twins\n\n[Chorus: Xzibit, J-Ro & Hurricane G]\nI'm

haters and snakes waiting for mistakes\nBut that's the breaks, the highs and lows of the industry\nD.I.T.C. and X to the Z\nGet it crackin' to the third degree\nXzibit breakin' niggas down like H.I.V\nWe bring rap to your city like B.E.T\nBut still feel California is the place to be, catastrophe\n\n[Verse 2: Tash]\nThe Alkaholiks is back to fry you extra crispy\nWith the skills that make the plots to try and diss me extra risky\nCause the time it takes to infiltrate and stop my forward motion\nCalifornia will have broken off and fell into the ocean\nCause I rocked around the world with my ill type skill\nStep for real or I'll leave your grill scarred like Seal\nCause I regulate the sectin where the drinks is getting blended\nCertified bartender, go catch the 40 when I send it your way\n\n[Verse 3: Xzibit]\nNiggas that hustle till the day light break\nGo to county 20 times, till can't go straight\nDon't nothing in the motherfucking world come free\nI'll never see a nine to five cause it just ain't me\n(It's like this)\nXzibit shall hustle, lift, build muscle\nAnd think like Russell\nSurvive and bring it live and direct\nTo any crowd throughout the world like this\nCome home and smoke a spliff in the Benz with Swift\n\n[Chorus: Xzibit, J-Ro & Hurricane G]\nI'm fucked up, J-Ro\nYeah, I'm fucked up too\nLooking at these bitches from a bird's eye view\nMy name is J-Ro from the Likwit Crew\nSo what nigga is it you wanna do?\n\n[Verse 4: J-Ro]\nMy flow is metaphorical, historically correct\nWhat do you expect from a nigga with my intellect?\nEast coast representing West coast gangsta\nNah, I ain't tripping, I call up King Tee, we go dipping\nThrough the streets pumping hardcore Likwit beats\nFlowing air, blowing, lounging in them leather seats\nThinking back how we used to rock the house party\nNow we just fucking it up for everybody\n\n[Verse 5: Xzibit]\nHow dare you try to compare yourself to the original\nProfessional Xzibit break you down like correctional facility's\nLimit all capabilities, motherfuck MC's\nHard to read like Japanese\nI'm spreading like disease so I can't be stopped\nBy who you run with, your clique or the bitch ass cops\nXzibit\u2019s first LP, it hit your block like crack rock\nI\u2019m blowing up your spot by remote, it's the cutthroat\n\n[Verse 6: J-Ro]\nI\"m from Cristal-ifornia, I warned ya I'd be on ya\nI'm off the paint like velvet paintings, make your mama mourn ya\nThe Ro is outer national, cold as Henne-sota\nI smoke 12 MC's a day just to fill my quota\nFrom Fourty Ohio all the way to Ore-gin\nBuddy, my fingers are bloody, now I'm Washing-ten\nI clown from Brew-york down to Mai-tai-ami\nI soak up game like a shamm,y understand me?\n\n[Chorus: Xzibit, J-Ro & Hurricane G]\nI'm fucked up, J-Ro\nYeah, I'm fucked up too\nLooking at these bitches from a bird's eye view\nMy name is J-Ro from the Likwit Crew\nSo what nigga is it you wanna do?\n\n[Verse 7: Tash]\nSo Elizabeth it's MC's that's coming to join ya\nSome will be from NYC and some will be from California\nCause I drop the lyrics on you from beneath the Earth's surface\nWhere I write rhymes so fresh I try to bite my own verses\nCause the purpose of my flow is to let you know\nMy style is badder than the water down in Mexico\nCause RICO blend styles like juice and gin\nI got the Likwit shit that have you seeing double like the Twins\n\n[Chorus: Xzibit, J-Ro & Hurricane G]\nI'm fucked up, J-Ro\nYeah, I'm fucked up too\nLooking at these bitches from a bird's eye view\nMy name is J-Ro from the Likwit Crew\nSo what nigga is it you wanna do?"}},

breakin' they neck\nMove the crowd without breakin' a sweat\nTrendsetter, with a Beretta, so keep it on deck\n'Cause you never know when Xzibit gonna roll through the set\nDon't be scared, just be prepared and quiet as kept\nAt a nightclub, talkin' 'bout you don't go out\nAnd you tryin' to got to school to make a certain amount\nBut the last part, I just couldn't figure it out\nI guess its real hard to talk with a dick in your mouth\nLightweight, like confetti\nSteadily tested by motherfuckers who ain't ready\nTo deal with the legendary\nSoopafly, X-Z, and Bullet Loco\nShot callers, clear the whole block like we po-po\n\n[Chorus: Method Man]\nRound and round we go, it don't stop\n'Til we all get dough, c'mon, make it hot\nBaby girl do the pussy pop, pussy pop\nLick shots for the pussy

Moon Villa\nWith a killa and a cocaine dealer, layin' low from the law\nSee, it all comes down to who's quick to draw first\nPay attention, prevention, ridin' off in a hearse\nMister X to the you know

Xzibit]\nYeah, when it's all said in done, we gon' be on top\n'Cause we don't stop, now, lock it down, hit the spot\nAnd clown niggas relyin' on special effects\nWhile the khakis and chronic, got the bitches still breakin' they neck\nMove the crowd without breakin' a sweat\nTrendsetter, with a Beretta, so keep it on deck\n'Cause you never know when Xzibit gonna roll through the set\nDon't be scared, just be prepared and quiet as kept\nAt a nightclub, talkin' 'bout you don't go out\nAnd you tryin' to got to school to make a certain amount\nBut the last part, I just couldn't figure it out\nI guess its real hard to talk with a dick in your mouth\nLightweight, like confetti\nSteadily tested by motherfuckers who ain't ready\nTo deal with the legendary\nSoopafly, X-Z, and Bullet Loco\nShot callers, clear the whole block like we po-po\n\n[Chorus: Method Man]\nRound and round we go, it don't stop\n'Til we all get dough, c'mon, make it hot\nBaby girl do the pussy pop, pussy pop\nLick shots for the pussy pop, pop, pop!\nLookin' good with your stink-ass\nType of ass make a nigga pull it over fast\nMake it hot, baby girl do the pussy pop, pussy pop\nLick shots for the pussy pop, pop pop!\n\n[Verse 2: Jayo Felony]\nThis bitch ain't got the pot to piss in\nKeepin' it next to the name and her gun\nThis the Dulo gang bitch\nWho the fuck want some?\nYou got titties and ass\nBut I got a dick and some cash\nIf you ain't talkin' about shit\nThen I'ma smash, bitch\nOn three, on me, bitch, you my property\nDaddy Jayo Felony, and ain't nobody stoppin' me\nAnd I said daddy, bitch, yeah, that's what you gon' call me\nI ain't no simp or no wimp\nI'ma motherfuckin pimp\nTerrorizin' my hoes, make they high-heels fall off\nYou got me close to fucked up, if you think I'm goin' soft\nOn ya; I'm hard on my hoes, that's how it goes\nBitch, get up off your toes, and get my six-four\nYou got my name, you bounced\nSo you might as well break bread\nAnd only Dulo niggas know, what's the head\nMy name is Billy Loco, and this is my opinion\nI'm coming from SD, and Dulo is my religion\nBi-b-b-b-biatch!\n\n[Chorus: Method Man]\nRound and round we go, it don't stop\n'Til we all get dough, c'mon, make it hot\nBaby girl do the pussy pop, pussy pop\nLick shots for the pussy pop, pop, pop!\nLookin' good with your stink-ass\nThe type of ass make a nigga pull it over fast\nMake it hot, baby girl do the pussy pop, pussy pop\nLick shots for the pussy pop, pop pop!\n\n[Verse 3: Xzibit]\nI don't save 'em, pay 'em, or buy clothes\nAll I really wanna do is win the game, fuck hoes!\nIn Jamaica, at the Half Moon Villa\nWith a killa and a cocaine dealer, layin' low from the law\nSee, it all comes down to who's quick to draw first\nPay attention, prevention, ridin' off in a hearse\nMister X to the you know me\nThousand-dollar bitches wanna pop the pussy for free\nThe dysfunctional member of the Alkaholik family tree\nFrequently bang bitches, Wu-Tang, Killer Bee\nHennessey on the rocks, with Pina Colada\nAt the Ramada, make you work hard like Donna\nFor the cheese, got you down on your hands and knees\nAfter that, we kickin' back and burn up some trees\nMad shout, 'cause Xzibit's not the type to be treatin'\n'Cause, I'm an Alkaholik. and I'm late for my meeting\n(Come on, Like that!)\n\n[Chorus: Method Man]\nRound and round we go, it don't stop\n'Til we all get dough, c'mon, make it hot\nBaby girl do the pussy pop, pussy pop\nLick shots for the pussy pop, pop, pop!\nLookin' good with your stink-ass\nType of ass make a nigga pull it over fast\nMake it hot, baby girl do the pussy pop, pussy pop\nLick shots for the pussy pop, pop pop!"}}, {"title": "Eyes May Shine (Remix)", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "[Intro: Xzibit +

Mobb Deep\n(No doubt) Beatin' down\n(No doubt) Once again, bring it live\n(No doubt) Yeah, like this\n\n[Verse 1: Xzibit]\nI'm on a path not taken bout a average man\nBlack Sedan my way through pitfalls and scams\nLet the whole world know about this Likwit camp\nProgrammed to ignite on site\nSo now I'm standing in a whole new light (whole new light)\nIn an area where niggas ain't tryin to fight (tryin to fight)\nI feel my jaw get tight (jaw get tight)\nIt's like these niggas get pumped up, and lick shots\nAt you and yours, plus the motherfuckin' cops\nWe got, blocks and blocks of non-stop hustle\n21 backdrop, it's my turn to shuffle\nStay alert, little pussy on the side can't hurt\nWear protection from the heat so I don't get burnt\nI got no time to be a star...\nI go straight from the car to the bar, and then get busy\nWhenever provoked, I react like Bill Bixby\nIncredible heat, X-to the-Z and The Infamous Mobb Deep\nTake it to the street\nDon't waste my time (waste my time)\nTrying to disrespect me in your half-assed rhyme\nThat ass is mine\nBeen going down like this since the beginning of time\nEyes may shine\n\n[Hook: Xzibit + (Havoc)]\nEyes May Shine, teeth may grit, and all of that shit\nAnd you still won't step, so what's next (What's next?)\nAll of a sudden, you ain't sayin' nuttin'\n(You better off buckin' yourself, you need to stop frontin')\nEyes May Shine, teeth may grit, and all of that shit\nAnd you still won't step, so what's next (What's next?)\nAll of a sudden, you ain't sayin' nuttin'\n(You better off buckin' yourself, you need to stop frontin')\n\n[Verse 2: Havoc]\nAyo, I love my niggas for that, it strikes back, handle business\nTest the realest, stay focused and keep the, enemy near us\nNiggas is careless, slippin' up, switchin' up teams\nCrossin' over, and gettin' stuck for they +C.R.E.A.M+\nFrontin' like the skills, is superb and got the nerve\nTo get knocked the fuck out and kicked to the curb\nThat's for you and your whole click\nYou rollin' thick, more the better\nSo like a thick bitch, you gettin' ripped, shitted on\nScuffed off a Mobb Deep song\nTake your thug off, he had it on a bit too long\nTuck your chain in, you're gettin' yapped\nFor your faulty karat slum gold Cubic Zirconian ass havin'\nTalk about it, be about it\nYou ain't been doing this, so don't start\nMatter fact, keep it movin'\nWhen it's on, accumulate like cancer cells\nWith advanced sells, leave a snitch dead, son, he can't tell\n\n[Hook: Xzibit + (Mobb Deep)]\nEyes May Shine, teeth may grit, and all of that shit\nAnd you still won't step, so what's next (What's next?)\nAll of a sudden, you ain't sayin' nuttin'\n(You better off buckin' yourself...)\nEyes May Shine, teeth may grit, and all of that shit\nAnd you still won't step, so what's next (What's next?)\nAll of a sudden, you ain't sayin' nuttin'\n(You better off buckin' yourself...)\n\n[Verse 3: Prodigy]\nYo, I send shots to any man that come too close\nNiggas get fold like a letter to ship across coast\nWho go? To go against my Militant Crime Militia\nLike these street niggas sendin' missiles to hit 'cha\nUp from the ground up, son, you get the picture\nIf not, write it down, take a picture\nBotanical exotic shit keep me lifted, somethin' retarded\nYou fuckin' up my high beefin', don't get me started\nToo late, I'm already on your ass\nBeat the fuck out of anybody witcha, and anybody that grab me\nMove back, we attack like pits locked in basements\nHungry for blood, derangedest\nCraziest type of shit you ever seen in your life\nNigga bled to death, standing up, holding his life\nApplying pressure to his wounds trying to stop the blood loss\nFound laying in a pool of the shit, his own fault\nIt's P the Exaulted from NYC, you get extremely\nCut the fuck up by scar thieves\nWho can't recognize, do I have to prove all the time\nThen get up close and personal in front of your eyes\nSee me dipped and down-low, ready for action, crept slow\nMoved on ya enterprise and crash ya stock\nPut a hold on your assets and dug your pock'\nThese National Geographic niggas is known for flippin'\nThis animal wildlife, surround me I live in\nAnd float through the jungle at night on expedition\nI got a jones for that live shit\nSurvivors of block wars and crime niggas know what I talk\nIn a black Tahoe, throw it in four load and blow the scene dancin\nDoing 'bout a hundred all the way to Queens...\n\n[Hook: Xzibit + (Prodigy)]\nEyes May Shine, teeth may grit, and all of that shit\nAnd you still won't step, so what's next?\nAll of a sudden, you ain't sayin' nuttin'\n(You better off buckin' yourself, you need to stop frontin')\nEyes May Shine, teeth may grit, and all of that shit\nAnd you still won't step, so what's next?

be the best, I'm doin it all for you\nYou know that thing with the peanut butter\nMy Brooklyn bitch said fuck untyin the ropes\nIt's faster with a box cutter\nI know you love the way I'm diggin you out\nBut always wanna fuckin argue so let's figure this out\nI'm just tryna make you happy bitch\nWho's there for you anytime you get in the mood for suckin a dick\nI took the time out to find out what ya like\nYou bust fifteen nuts, wanna get up and fight\nSo look\n\n[Hook]\nYou should thank of all the bitches that I have in my life\nAll the experience I'm gettin got me fuckin you right\nNever

Miami\nCandy, Trisha, Prescilla, Melissa\nShowed X to the Z it's better with three\nWho could fuck your ass better than me (pssst)\nI think not, hard knock the cock, welcome to my sweat shop\nI pick locks made by NFL, NBA, NHL, fuck all day\nYou could say I didn't do this shit\nUnsatisfied bitches gotta go out and chase the dick\nAnd that's just not the thing to do\nSo I learn new shit from the next bitch and teach it to you\nNow don't you love it how I shove it baby (hell yeah)\nWhen we be fuckin and we thuggin baby (hell yeah)\nThe way I hit it when I pump it baby (hell yeah)\nAnd don't I spit it when I bust it baby (hell yeah)\n\n[Hook]\nYou should thank of all the bitches that I have in my life\nAll the experience I'm gettin got me fuckin you right\nNever took time to see it and

know somethin that might excite up our late night\nGot an open invite to lay us a pipe\nMake ya head feel like your wet, warm and tight\nI'll go from all night 'til the sun turn bright\nTwo wrongs don't make it right bitch, no need to cheat\n(Pussy just a piece of meat, another means to eat)\nBig Tray D told me that, as a matter of fact\nYou only tell me that you love me when you're flat on

nuts hang, Cali bang at seventeen\nNow I got everything, bitch, I got everything\n\n[Verse 1]\nMy back was to the wall, risked it all, after all, all I had was me\nJust tenacity, some old weed with some swisha sweets\nNow everything I ride around got a captain seat\nFuck y'all dry, sawed-off and done rapidly\nPartner, now let's be honest, ain't got no good intentions\nThe opportunist it's you moving in my position\nBut I'm a heavyweight, humble, hitting the heavy bag\nWaiting for the day I stumble across your fucking ass\nInstead I push the work in, chin up and chest out\nPicking the shit up where I left off\nYou went soft and sensitive, too timid to tangle with the Lost Angel\nI admit it, I bull shit and gave you the wrong angle\nNow I have a seat at my table, let me do you the business\nDiversify you millions, you can live off the interest\nMake every revenue stream flood, see where it took me\nAnd make that money stack higher than giraffe's pussy\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nI used to have a Glock that I would shoot through a backpack\nSo it wouldn't leave no shells at the scene\nWhen I was getting my gift-back\nYeah, this for the homie whack, roll through and chop it up\nOn hard to make the west diveded a united front\nBurn big, light it up, waiting on that vending truck\nSo I can crush the corner, welcome to California\nWhere people fake it 'till they make it\nOr take it with a hand gun\nTake your chances, swing, try to land one\nNow you're in the box like a samsung, I march through the madness\nMy symphony deliver something classic\nEither you ironclad or you plastic, jumped in or drafted\nEither way, you got to salute the flag, who you rollin' with?\nI acknowledge honest with whole heart and integrity\nPeople keep telling me I'm about to catch a felony\nStage presence, reminiscent of a flashbang\nGave my girl a son and my last name\n\n[Hook]\n\nThey're talking about they locked up in a coop in the mansion\nI'm saying you can't knock me off the square that I stand in\nNobody gave me nothing, this is just where I landed\nCause now I got everything, bitch, I got everything\n\n[Verse 3]\n\nMotherfucker, my livin room look like a drive in\nWhen I open my eyes a bunch of bitches play violins\nNothing but respect when I walk through the lions den\nBecause I kill everything, bitch, I kill everything\nNothing ever compares with the strength of a free mind\nYou find the most dangerous weapon ever acquired by mankind\nUse it too fight for your freedom and oppress your oppressors\nWhen you mold them and lead them, fuck a positive message\nThis is a lifetime of lessons, boiled down to the essence\nThere's no payment for passage, my immaculate presence\nMake every revenue stream flood, look where it took me\nAnd make that money stack higher than giraffe pussy\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/727e047579481405310e18c83d10416c.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Xzibit", "raw": {"annotation_count": 7, "api_path":

sixteen\nLet my nuts hang, Cali bang at seventeen\nNow I got everything, bitch, I got everything\n\n[Verse 1]\nMy back was to the wall, risked it all, after all, all I had was me\nJust tenacity, some old weed with some swisha sweets\nNow everything I ride around got a captain seat\nFuck y'all dry, sawed-off and done rapidly\nPartner, now let's be honest, ain't got no good intentions\nThe opportunist it's you moving in my position\nBut I'm a heavyweight, humble, hitting the heavy bag\nWaiting for the day I stumble across your fucking ass\nInstead I push the work in, chin up and chest out\nPicking the shit up where I left off\nYou went soft and sensitive, too timid to tangle with the Lost Angel\nI admit it, I bull shit and gave you the wrong angle\nNow I have a seat at my table, let me do you the business\nDiversify you millions, you can live off the interest\nMake every revenue stream flood, see where it took me\nAnd make that money stack higher than giraffe's pussy\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nI used to have a Glock that I would shoot through a backpack\nSo it wouldn't leave no shells at the scene\nWhen I was getting my gift-back\nYeah, this for the homie whack, roll through and chop it up\nOn hard to make the west diveded a united front\nBurn big, light it up, waiting on that vending truck\nSo I can crush the corner, welcome to California\nWhere people fake it 'till they make it\nOr take it with a hand gun\nTake your chances, swing, try to land one\nNow you're in the box like a samsung, I march through the madness\nMy symphony deliver something classic\nEither you ironclad or you plastic, jumped in or drafted\nEither way, you got to salute the flag, who you rollin' with?\nI acknowledge honest with whole heart and integrity\nPeople keep telling me I'm about to catch a felony\nStage presence, reminiscent of a flashbang\nGave my girl a son and my last name\n\n[Hook]\n\nThey're talking about they locked up in a coop in the mansion\nI'm saying you can't knock me off the square that I stand in\nNobody gave me nothing, this is just where I landed\nCause now I got everything, bitch, I got everything\n\n[Verse 3]\n\nMotherfucker, my livin room look like a drive in\nWhen I open my eyes a bunch of bitches play violins\nNothing but respect when I walk through the lions den\nBecause I kill everything, bitch, I kill everything\nNothing ever compares with the strength of a free mind\nYou find the most dangerous weapon ever acquired by mankind\nUse it too fight for your freedom and oppress your oppressors\nWhen you mold them and lead them, fuck a positive message\nThis is a lifetime of lessons, boiled down to the essence\nThere's no payment for passage, my immaculate presence\nMake every revenue stream flood, look where it took me\nAnd make that money stack higher than giraffe pussy\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "What a Mess", "album": "Man vs Machine", "year": null, "lyrics": "Yeah, keep

what time it is!\nXzibit steps up to the mic\nLayin down the hard-core, real raw, underground\nMy name is KRS-One, and it's REAL!!\n\n[Xzibit]\nWell it's me, down with D-R-E\nX to the Z rocks any party\nRocks the beats, and the breaks\nRocks the cocks off the whores in the place\nCause suckers shake, while I'm creatin\nThey get together and they start to hatin\nHow can we take him out one time\nCause he brought back the West with the freshest rhymes\nI might go first, and he'll go second\nI'll wreck 'em, deck 'em, set it, just checkin your mic\nDroppin hot shit I like\nSo throw up your hands bitch, run your ice\nCause I'll go third, and he'll go fourth\nBy the fifth eat shit, you'll step off\nSix is your beatdown, your title is seven\nTakin out your four man crew makes eleven\nBy the twelveth I go for self\nRockin L.A. like no one else..\nYou can check any rapper from the underground scene\nBut few have dropped hot shit and seen green\nSome have dope twelve inches, count 'em\nBut not many niggas have slammin albums\nX to the Z rocks consistantly\nI'm \"Criminal Minded\" so don't fuck with me\nWhy? Well that's my secret baby\nI don't take shit, so fuck you, pay me\nSo you can call me, a public servant\nNot a king but a teacher I believe I've earned it\nSo I just walk, or ride my bike\nAnd bust on the +Up In Smoke+ stage tonight\nGive me a chance and I'll rock the house\nBut let a motherfucker try to take me out\nCause male or female, I will strangle\nIf it's a label, they have to untangle\nAdidas, chains, jerseys, braids\nBandanas hangin off the end of my gauge\nStep right up if that's what you like\nBut watch your bitch, I catch hoes like a dyke\nIn the night at a height right for flight\nWay out of sight, you bite, I recite\nMy chain shine bright, plus my kicks stay white\nAs your faggot CEO say, \"Well alright!\"\n.. I am your mentor\nHistory is mine, it's time you surrender motherfuckers\nAnd just back up quickly\nYour style is sickly but you persist to get me\nOr outwit me with the style that I created\nYears ago when I was sellin powder to the hoes\nOh, all of a sudden you don't know\nOr can't remember can't recall can't bring to mind\nThat rhyme that place do not chase\nI run a marathon a race of rhymes in your FACE\nIn case you hate I won't write no tough rap\nFuck with me get your whole FAMILY kidnapped\n\n[KRS-One]\nYo Xzibit! Show these motherfuckers man!\nI don't think they understand this shit!\nBreak this shit over they backs!\n\n[Xzibit]\nI don't dress up to rap or keep a hairdo\nI only grab a nine to bust holes in your crew\nI deny your existence as artists\nYou puttin out a record expectin to chart but it's weak\nBut when you speak through the microphone\nYou fail to realize, nope, you're not alone on the earth\nThe light comes forth cause Mr. X\nIntelligence, smoke and guns manifest in the flesh\nI snatch the mic and get hype\nBehave, before you make the news front page\nHeaded for the grave and the wake\nSo save your microscopic miniature small talk and WALK\nAnd put a little pep in your step\nX to the Z will destroy any motherfuckin rep-utation\nIn the nation, in creation\nAll you assholes in ANY occupation\nLike rappers with nothin to say\nI CRUSH 'EM like chronic and then smoke 'em with Dre\nCause no matter how fatter the wallet, I'd rather\nGather together and splatter\nWhatever egotistic bullshit, the game is over\nWhen you push the record but don't push the culture\n\n[KRS-One]\nBreakin, emceein, graffiti art, deejayin, beatboxin\nYo Xzibit, keep rockin!\n\n[Xzibit]\nJust throw your hands in the sky\nStill believe real niggas never die\nAnd if you in this life just gettin by\nSomebody say, \"I'm high!\"\n(I'm high!) \"I'm high!\"\n(I'm high!) Yeah, and you don't stop\nYeah..\n\n[KRS-One]\nWoop woop, woop, woop woop!\nYou know what time it is\nPull over, all wack emcees, AHH-AHHH!\nYo.. YO! You are tuned in.. to the ultimate..\nUnderground.. rawness!

Raaaange - RENTAL\nI was smokin drinkin end up kind of tipsy (YEAH!)\nLookin through my rearview they followin me (huh)\nI wonder why the fuck are they followin me (huh)\nI seen them niggas creepin two cars behind me (hmm)\nYou'll never catch me slippin just me and my - PIECE\nYou must be smokin if you think I'ma call the - POLICE\n\n[Xzibit]\nI'm a beast, still got a crease\nStill got my Converse stompin down the concrete\nYEAHHHHHHHHHH - black and blue Bugati\nThis is Strong Arm robbery, you can't deny me\nMy garage a mirage a collage of chrome\nI look alive with the nine when I leave my home\nBeen on tour in Japan, been relaxed in Rome\nThis is grown man business, recognize the tone\nIf I don't recognize the number won't, answer my phone\nRockin every area code still stay in my zone\nI don't play no fuckin games now bitch I'm grown\nNow crack your fuckin neck to the shit I'm on\nYeah!\n\n[Chorus: Jelly Roll]\nI be dippin through my city in a ragtop rollin\nBounce, rock, ragtop rollin\nBend the corner, AHHHHH, ragtop rollin\nAll up in your bitch face, ragtop rollin\n\n[Xzibit]\nYeah, YEAH\nMy release, bang through the streets\nWe hang like orangutans, mangle the beat\nNiggas hatin, gravitatin to the lies that they tell\nMy reality takin over where that fiction fail\nWhat the hell, might as well show the cards I'm holdin\nSweet taste, aromatic, backwood ROLLIN\nGot the Range Rover supercharged, complete with the strut kit\nMy chain hang to my dang-a-lang, what the fuck bitch?\nBoomerang my change (YEAH) I rearrange some thangs\nMy slang click-bang and expose they brains\nThen I pray, \"Our Father who art in Heaven\"\nGot people jumpin out the buildin like 9/11\nMalcolm X to the Z landin on them like Plymouth Rock (yeah!)\nYou get knocked out, get socked in your fuckin mouth\nNow e'rybody know the business, you want it come get it (c'mon)\nBut if you ROLLIN throw it up, let me know that you with it\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Interlude: Jelly Roll]\nCaaaaadillaaaaacs, Cooooupe Devilllllles\nOh shit I'm on wheels, rollin for reeeeeal\n\n[Xzibit]\nYEAH, I repeat, my name over beats\nI binge on the finer things, you cringe in defeat\nEscalation, elevation to another plateau\nSometimes ya take a few steps back to mentally grow\nHere we go, what you know, campaign in motion\nStraight West coast and West worldwide ROLLIN\nGot that Aston Martin DV9 equipped with a stash box\nIn case I ever find myself alone in a tight spot\nStrip down my frame, repave my lane\nInsane with my ink pen, Citizen Kane\nDon't complain when the chamber slide back and bang\nMake it taste like shit when you sayin my name\nIt's the Golden State heavyweight, holdin the belt\nCause I'm a one man army, I don't need no help\nThis is a \u2013 PISTOL, I use to protect myself\nCareful these hammerhead hollow points is bad for your health\nMy nia\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Interlude]\n\n[Intro \u2013 echoes at the end]"}}, {"title": "Stand Tall",

divided trough the struggle, we fall\nGot my city on a map, now\nThat\u2019s why I could never back down\nNever back down, show \u2018em through it all\nYou gotta stand tall\n\n[Verse 1: Xzibit]\nTo all of my friends, enemies and affiliates\nBurn the back wood, burn it down to your fingertips\nLet the whole world recognize this accomplishment\nYou couldn\u2019t have told me none of this back in \u201996\nThe ability to crawl up out of bottomless pits\nThis is our time I\u2019m spending mine rockin' this bitch\nI still remember the very moment I was enlisted\nI studied on the sadistic, gangster is worth the business\nAnd when there\u2019s blood in the streets from my brothers and sisters\nThey wanna debate on television about the victim\nRight or wrong, if Treyvon was my little man\nI would take a chainsaw to Zimmerman\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Xzibit]\nFor all the moments I wasted on making others happy\nAttack me, I\u2019m bulletproof, hack me, I'll send a virus through\nI've never lied to you, still roll with a chosen few\nSpit every word and I mean it, meanin' I'll really body you\n\u2018Cause I would rather be in hell than a jail cell\nI\u2019m hancock, superhero slamming cocktails\nI never fail, don\u2019t try to patronize me\nAlert and painfully aware of everything in my surroundings\nI am shamefuly shining, never touched the silver lining\nThe only cross that I bear is covered with some fucking diamonds\nI hear my city calling, here come the juggernaut\nWit' twelve hundred soldiers in the parking lot\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Slim The Mobster]\nSo, failure ain't an option\nHow do you think I made it out that corner apartment?\nTurn my corner to my market, and now I target the same Niggas\nThat taught on all that dumb shit\nBecause when the gun clicking\nThat bullet leaving can\u2019t get that life back\nKarma is a bitch and believe me, she\u2019ll get it right back\nThey say that success is the best revenge\nBut who really wins if we all die in the end\nIf I had it all, then I probably wouldn\u2019t pray the same\nAnd the club that I come from sticks the debt with the pain\nMy name good in every corner in my city\nYou don\u2019t believe me, then come fuck with me\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/727e047579481405310e18c83d10416c.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Xzibit", "raw": {"annotation_count": 14, "api_path":

really body you\n\u2018Cause I would rather be in hell than a jail cell\nI\u2019m hancock, superhero slamming cocktails\nI never fail, don\u2019t try to patronize me\nAlert and painfully aware of everything in my surroundings\nI am shamefuly shining, never touched the silver lining\nThe only cross that I bear is covered with some fucking diamonds\nI hear my city calling, here come the juggernaut\nWit' twelve hundred soldiers in the parking lot\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Slim The Mobster]\nSo, failure ain't an option\nHow do you think I made it out that corner apartment?\nTurn my corner to my market, and now I target the same Niggas\nThat taught on all that dumb shit\nBecause when the gun clicking\nThat bullet leaving can\u2019t get that life back\nKarma is a bitch and believe me, she\u2019ll get it right back\nThey say that success is the best revenge\nBut who really wins if we all die in the end\nIf I had it all, then I probably wouldn\u2019t pray the same\nAnd the club that I come from sticks the debt with the pain\nMy name good in every corner in my city\nYou don\u2019t believe me, then come fuck with me\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "Scent of a Woman", "album": "Weapons of

the fuck back in, it's like I'm never gon' win\nNigga got the whole world on his back\nOver react, matter fact we act like when animals attack\nI know, pussy sells faster than crack, ambassador

this is shit that I was born to say\nThough lately I been having dillemas, with insignificant niggas\nAnd half-ass rappers that think they can get it\nWe the Golden State, we keep the whole thing

bangin.. come on.. yeah.. look..\n\n[Verse 1: Xzibit]\nHuh, Stay in my lane like a hustla\nNever hate a motherfucker, tolerate a motherfucker\nTo a certain extent\nWhen it's on, it's over\nDon't get no chance to get popping\nForgotten about you before your body cold in a coffin\nJust another failed attempt, you fall through the cracks\nSure as God made man, the first man was Black\nThe Black man made pyramids and gangsta rap\nThat's all I know, cuz poppa didn't raise no rats\nFace the facts not the fiction\nI Build my empire from a pocket full of stones\nAnd a fifth of ambition\nNiggas wanna ball but they never wanna listen\nSo instead of coming up, they just, come up missin\nMy mission is to hit with precision, shake whole continents\nCrush niggas' confidence, expose my dominance\nWithout no conflict, you'll never have progress\nI'm sending this one out to all the neighborhoods and projects, I'm a\n\n[Hook: Anthony Hamilton (Xzibit)]\nOne shot gambler (Yeah) Two shot gambler (Come on)\nThree-time felon with that itch for dough\nThese mad street (Whuttup) Got me puffin on dro'\nI'm guilty (What) Tryna make a living (Work it)\nThirty-eight albums and still no dollars (Come on)\nAnd you wanna know why I hit the block for mo'? (Yeah)\nThese madd street (Uh) Got me puffin on dro' (Uh)\nI'm guilty .. For tryna make a living\n\n[Verse 2: Xzibit]\nBitch I ain't tryna holler at you (nah)\nI'm just wanna drink, smoke, fuck and toss a couple dollars at you\nI'm fightin dirty, I'll take thirty of you motherfuckers\nI'm throwing cheapshots, low-blows and suckerpunches\nI'm not for the games, I'm not in the mood\nNot to be confused with dudes that fumble and lose\nXzibit move when I hear oppurtunity knockin\nBut I'mma shoot straight through the door if you comin with problems\nIt's too crowded at the bottom, too lonely at the top\nAin't no inbetween, trust me, like it or not\nWe gon' be here forever like cops and roaches\nDo not approach us, ferocious, we pop them toasters, nigga\n\n[Interlude: Anthony Hamilton (Xzibit)]\nI'mma have to hit the block, then around to my hoes\nI got a haze, two trays, and a change of clothes, cuz\nPimpin' ain't easy y'all,it's too sleazy\nToo greasy, and I can't take it easy!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Xzibit]\nEverytime I try to get out\nI get dragged right the fuck back in, it's like I'm never gon' win\nNigga got the whole world on his back\nOver react, matter fact we act like when animals attack\nI know, pussy sells faster than crack, ambassador rap\nTwist back your salary cap, who fuckin with that?\nWelcome to the X games, enjoy my pain\nInhale my smoke, it's hard not to cough or choke\nMotorola nigga up the old fashion way\nThis ain't rap, this is shit that I was born to say\nThough lately I been having dillemas, with insignificant niggas\nAnd half-ass rappers that think they can get it\nWe the Golden State, we keep the whole thing bouncing\nY'all move units, we move mountains\nY'all rap for bullshit, tryna be on T.V\nWe seen you, now we don't like Chandra Levy, I'mma\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "Los Angeles Times", "album": "40

tables\nTo their most upright, and long position\nAlso at this time please take care to fasten your seatbelt\nEnjoy your stay, welcome to L.A\n\n[Chorus]\nWelcome to L.A, where you can see the whole city burning\nCause the cops got uzis and the dealers keep serving\nAnd your kids ain't learning shit, except this\nSex power and wealth, fuck everything else\nWelcome to L.A, where you can see the whole city burning\nCause the cops got uzis and the dealers keep serving\nAnd your kids ain't learning shit, except this\nTrying to survive, Los Angeles Times\n\n[Verse 1]\nMC's get fucked up, chopped like Braveheart\nDon't start what you can't finish, serious bidness\nDown La Cienega to bust a left on Venice\nWhere you can find me and mines -- Los Angeles Times\nWelcome to L.A\nWhere every other day I'm taking the hat off my head\nGivin respect to the dead, and avoid havin the same thing\nSaid about me, Xzibit stand underground\nLike the roots of a tree, watered three times a day\nForty ounce Olde E, like a magnifying glass\nMaking it easier to see, the Mister X to the Z\nDon't P, L.A., why test without vest-es\nStop lead projectile, Apocalypse Now\nLove Allah not new car, faggot, superstar\nType of cat, fuck that, mash away in a\nDiamond-white Concours 'Llac\nStill black so the one-time react as if under attack\nAin't nothin changed but district range, feel no pain\nMr. Big Bad Insane Black John McClane with\nLiquor on the brain, down to earth like dirt\nFrom the city where niggas known for puttin in work\n\n[Chorus]\nWelcome to L.A, where you can see the whole city burning\nCause the cops got uzis and the dealers keep serving\nAnd your kids ain't learning shit, except this\nSex power and wealth, fuck everything else\nWelcome to L.A, where you can see the whole

dick size, I'm palmin the Earth\nSelect turf, then plant bad seed and give birth\nAnd make the hard work look easy fuh sheezee\nLeavin you and your best man, stiffer than mannequins\nEnough to break the skin on a Vietnam leatherneck\nMarine drill sergeant, you nothin but a target (pow!)\nCharge it to the game, gotta look beyond the brand name\nComin from the guts like I slammed down twenty cups\nOf Hennesey straight, relate feel my hate\nXzibit flippin through these bitches like DJ trait\nTranslate to left field, only real niggas follow\nBitches suck and swallow, I'm livin life behind the bottle\nNever the role model, still shinin like a new automobile\nFlow six-fo', you can't steal\nCause I got a kill switch with a itch for the action\nWhile other rappers use mass weapons of destruction\nTo sell they shit\n\n[Chorus]\nWelcome to L.A, where you can see the whole city burning\nCause the cops got uzis and the dealers keep serving\nAnd your kids ain't learning shit, except this\nSex power and wealth, fuck everything else\nWelcome to L.A, where you can see the whole city burning\nCause the cops got uzis and the dealers keep serving\nAnd your kids ain't learning shit, except this\nTrying to survive, Los Angeles Times\n\n[Verse 3]\nEl ve-te-rano, you can only pray to learn what I know\nRide slow across the horizon a lone desperado\nComin through the door bringin nothin but hits\nSometimes I feel like a matador, lookin at this bullshit\nNiggas pull rent from the crack of they ass\nMaintain do your thang this too shall pass\nI season beef with lead pieces then cook it with gas\nI'm from the school of hard knocks way ahead in the class\nXzibit hard to get through, like bulletproof glass\nBreak it down like Johnny Cochran then mix it with hash\nYour defense can't last against advanced prosecution\nHit the airwaves like pollution -- hey, here's a solution\nTake a trip to Washington then burn the Constitution\nTop government officials locked down for prostitution\nRecruitin the hard rocks mean streets keep producin\nThe world is a riot shit is mine for the lootin\n\n[Chorus]\nWelcome to L.A, where you can see the whole city burning\nCause the cops got uzis and the dealers keep serving\nAnd your kids ain't learning shit, except this\nSex power and wealth, fuck everything else\nWelcome to L.A, where you can see the whole city burning\nCause the cops got uzis and the dealers keep serving\nAnd your kids ain't learning shit, except this\nTrying to survive, Los Angeles Times\n\n[Bridge]\nEveryone's got to make a living\nEveryone's got to make a

bitches\nMany bodies that's buried in holes of many ditches\nMany, many homes, plenty chrome up on my whip\nPlenty stop for you\nMake me run up on your block and cock the semi\nReady, any nigga front, I hold it steady\nI cock back, pop the ratchet and spill your spaghetti\nProperties or blocks, we control 'em\nMany, many Glocks, know how I kill all your soldiers, Freddy\nMy machete will cut niggas like I ain't really like 'em\nThen carve a nigga meat deep like I'm killin' a bison\nTyson, animal instinct the way I will beat you\nGot many shots and plenty spots for them bullets to eat

yeah\nI wanna see you motherfuckers put your hands up\nStretch, bitch, like you doin' aerobics, motherfucker\nYeah\n\n[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]\nThought you was a tough guy?\nThen I put one right in ya head\nNow tell me what you think you is now\n(A top dollar biller, a Rottweiler, a killer\nSlap the shit out a nigga tryna copy my style)\n\n[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]\nI got cars, many switches, many hoes and many bitches\nMany bodies that's buried in holes of many ditches\nMany, many homes, plenty chrome up on my whip\nPlenty stop for you\nMake me run up on your block and cock the semi\nReady, any nigga front, I hold it steady\nI cock back, pop the ratchet and spill your spaghetti\nProperties or blocks, we control 'em\nMany, many Glocks, know how I kill all your soldiers, Freddy\nMy machete will cut niggas like I ain't really like 'em\nThen carve a nigga meat deep like I'm killin' a bison\nTyson, animal instinct the way I will beat you\nGot many shots and plenty spots for them bullets to eat you\nSee-through, them holes them bullets'll leave in between you\nIt seems you got left to die slow all up inside the venue\n\n[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]\nThought you was a tough guy?\nThen I put one right in ya head\nNow tell me what you think you is now\n(A top dollar biller, a Rottweiler, a killer\nSlap the shit out a nigga tryna copy my style)\n\n[Verse 2: Xzibit]\nOrangutangin', slangin', I'm hangin' over the edge\nI rock two 40 Glocks, I call 'em Barney and Fred\nI stay hungry like I'm only fed water and bread\nThe king of the castle get at you, screamin' off with ya head\nBrutal Bust and Mr. X-to-the-Z, we chart climbin'\nYou see my name next to that diamond, it's all timin'\nHit you in the stomach with somethin'\nYour face and feet'll be touchin'\nI'll have your bones start crackin' and bustin'\nTo my women who be workin' them jeans with fat asses\nRich Itala heels, Roberto Cavali glasses\nCome to my hideout, let me pimp your ride out\nHit your backside, tear your spine out and slide out\nYeah, 'cause my grind don't quit\nI'm a walkin' franchise with them extra clips\nI keep the bankroll thick, do lines so sick\nThat you can cut 'em with a razor blade, sniff the shit, come on\n\n[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]\nThought you was a tough guy?\nThen I put one right in ya head\nNow tell me what you think you is now\n(A top dollar biller, a Rottweiler, a killer\nSlap the shit out a nigga tryna copy my style)\n\n[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]\nI tell you, no lie\nBitch nigga, you gon' die\nKill or be killed or get bodied just because you walked by\nNigga be still 'fore the trigger go off and a shot fly\nAnd the shit'll be ill, if the shot turn your stomach to a pot pie\nNigga, we spill a lil liquor for the homie, muhfucka\nWe still'll make a nigga leak blood, 'til he need a refill\nYou tryna be a tough guy, and complicate what I build\nSomebody don't beat the shit out this muthafucka, we will\n\n[Verse 4: Xzibit]\nAsthmatic, dramatic, fold you like a Kraftmatic\nHeavy metal press hittin' your chest like a train wreck\nCommand respect, throw it one time for your set on deck\nNiggas you never forget\nI set up precedents, homie, you never snitch, hide the evidence\nDummies dig ditches, they dyin' for dead presidents\nThe big screen make 'em seem large like an elephant\nBut in real life, they so soft and so delicate\n\n[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]\nThought you was a tough guy?\nThen I put one right in ya head\nNow tell me what you think you is now\n(A top dollar biller, a Rottweiler, a killer\nSlap the shit out a nigga tryna copy my style)"}}, {"title":

games, taught him how to ride his first bike (that's it)\nThis is the life my little nigga, I see you gettin' all upset\nWhen I leave the house, poutin', let me tell you about\nTryna' make it in this world and provide for you\nCause on them overseat plane rides I miss you too\nNever knew that I would have to be away so much\nFive thousand dollar phone bills keepin' in touch\nWe Starskey and Hutch, yeah, we partners for life (yeah)\nI rock mics, so I'm sorry when I hug you if I squeeze too tight\nLong nights in the studio take me away\nGettin' mad cause I'm tired and you want me to play\nMoney

knuckle, a veteran and nothin' but muscle\nNow broadcastin' live from behind the wall\nStayin' tight through long kites and telephone calls\nGettin' hype when you see your brother on T.V\nCan't wait for your release so you can roll with me\nArrange everything exactly how it's supposed to be\nFor right now here's a thousand, J, stay low-key\nYou say damn Xzibit, whyn't you pay a nigga a visit\nTime limits got me movin a million miles a minute\nKnee deep, gotta strike while the iron is hot\nStill gotta eat and keep the lights on when it's not\nSleepin' on cots, bullet wounds got you in knots\nI wish I was there to snatch you up instead of the cops\nMuthafuck it, do the time and get it out of the way\nYou goin' from convict to corporate nigga in one day (in one day)\n\n[Chorus:

freakin' and mixin' rhymes in here\nNothin' but beer, bud smoke, Hen and Coke\nWomen and sheer, callin' playa niggas there\nNot the kinda place I really wanna bring my son\nGet on lil' Dane, gon' in there and have you some fun\nUsed to be there cook a beat up there sewin' your clothes\nWhile I'm with you on the Play Station showin' you codes\nHit the X button stupid, forward, left, right, X\nNow

that\nYou tryna figure out why dada talkin to you through this glass on the phone, oh, I socked a bitch and then she snitched\nBut I'll be home, can't keep me away, just can't stay away\nThat's my P.O

listen\nSorry I'm away so much, yeah, yeah\nAll the sons, daughters, penitentiary niggas, yeah feel me\nUh, sorry I'm away so much, yeah\n\n[Verse 1: Xzibit]\nMy son was born about four and a half years ago\nLoved and protected him, amazin' how fast they grow\nI came to know about his likes and his dislikes (yeah)\nVideo games, taught him how to ride his first bike (that's it)\nThis is the life my little nigga, I see you gettin' all upset\nWhen I leave the house, poutin', let me tell you about\nTryna' make it in this world and provide for you\nCause on them overseat plane rides I miss you too\nNever knew that I would have to be away so much\nFive thousand dollar phone bills keepin' in touch\nWe Starskey and Hutch, yeah, we partners for life (yeah)\nI rock mics, so I'm sorry when I hug you if I squeeze too tight\nLong nights in the studio take me away\nGettin' mad cause I'm tired and you want me to play\nMoney can't replace time, I'm just tryna get you outta the fine relyin' and expand your mind my lil' ni', yeah\nYeah, c'mon\n\n[Chorus-Xzibit]\nLook, sorry I'm away so much\nUnderstand me, yeah\nIt's for you, hah, yeah (you, and you, and you)\nC'mon, look, sorry I'm away so much\nHuh, we keep it gangsta\n\n[Verse 2: Xzibit]\nLook, I got a brother locked down, he be out in a couple\nKnuckle for knuckle, a veteran and nothin' but muscle\nNow broadcastin' live from behind the wall\nStayin' tight through long kites and telephone calls\nGettin' hype when you see your brother on T.V\nCan't wait for your release so you can roll with me\nArrange everything exactly how it's supposed to be\nFor right now here's a thousand, J, stay low-key\nYou say damn Xzibit, whyn't you pay a nigga a visit\nTime limits got me movin a million miles a minute\nKnee deep, gotta strike while the iron is hot\nStill gotta eat and keep the lights on when it's not\nSleepin' on cots, bullet wounds got you in knots\nI wish I was there to snatch you up instead of the cops\nMuthafuck it, do the time and get it out of the way\nYou goin' from convict to corporate nigga in one day (in one day)\n\n[Chorus: Xzibit]\nYeah, we keep it moving\nSorry I'm away so much\nAll the daughters, all the sons\nIt's for you, hah, yeah (you, and you, and you)\nC'mon, look, sorry I'm away so much\nHuh, we keep it gangsta\n\n[Verse 3: DJ Quik]\nNow I ain't never been this hot before\nSo in essence it's obvious, I ain't never been this out before\nI'm spending 25-8 days, 366 times a year\nUp in the studio freakin' and mixin' rhymes in here\nNothin' but beer, bud smoke, Hen and Coke\nWomen and sheer, callin' playa niggas there\nNot the kinda place I really wanna bring my son\nGet on lil' Dane, gon' in there and have you some fun\nUsed to be there cook a beat up there sewin' your clothes\nWhile I'm with you on the Play Station showin' you codes\nHit the X button stupid, forward, left, right, X\nNow I'm tryna get your college fund, bustin' with X\n\n[Outro: Suga Free]\nCome here, give that here dada\nNo no don't do that mama cause dada be back\nHere go your ba-ba, Pampers, flashy and you can see that\nYou tryna figure out why dada talkin to you through this glass on the phone, oh, I socked a bitch and then she snitched\nBut I'll be home, can't keep me away, just can't stay away\nThat's my P.O baby, she don't want nothin'\nShe just want me to pee in that cup, you want ba-ba?\nSleepy?"}},

Cain you Abel\nStart bullshit, conflicts, labels\nMan handled, murder, mangled\nLife support cut short we hold court\nIn the street make a nigga sleep six feet deep\nFuck piece bare back

mouth\nHands up jack the whole crowd\n(Break yourself right now)\n\n[Xzibit]\nBreak crash from ya ass so don't rush to bust\nBitches die, cry, and lust for us\nDamn it feel good to be platinum

tables\nGet cables, I'm Cain you Abel\nStart bullshit, conflicts, labels\nMan handled, murder, mangled\nLife support cut short we hold court\nIn the street make a nigga sleep six feet deep\nFuck piece bare back doggystyle\nCement ya feet and hold ya down\nThrow you off the bridge and watch you drown\nLast one to laugh its over now\n\n[Hook]\nWe'll trade ya six and pancake ya loan\nBreak ya bitch and take ya doe\nShake ya Crys and take it whoa\nLayin down the whole dance floor\n(Break yourself right now)\nOpen bar free drinks this way\nWalkin the West, possin the South\nCoke can put these in ya mouth\nHands up jack the whole crowd\n(Break yourself right now)\n\n[Xzibit]\nBreak crash from ya ass so don't rush to bust\nBitches die, cry, and lust for us\nDamn it feel good to be platinum plus\nDon't fuck wit us cuzz we dangerous\nHold fans like fiends on Angel Dust\nClean get aways I get out the cuffs\nCoast like a sailor you fuckin fucks\nI done hand it hard to keep in touch\nDon't pop the Crys I pop the clutch\nPop one to ya mouth cuzz you talk too much\nWay in over ya head you get played\nLeft holdin the bag like John Forte\nBuilt for this all work no play here to stay\nThe rest get blown away\nBuilt for this all work no play here to stay\nThe rest get blown away\nC'mon\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Xzibit]\nNeva seen heard felt befo\nWanna rumble wit us just start the show\nFill up the chamber let me go\nOut of town before the shells hit the floor\nDuck tape ski mask professional\nFuck y'all, y'all homosexual\nHangin on my dick like testicle\nPop you disappear, \"Where did he go?\"\nPop up some where in Mexico\nRotate relate respect the flow\nHospital bed you vegetable\nCan't walk can't talk lettin you know\nWe hit the hardest ask ya ho, at my show\nSeen her in the front row\nTo the back stage in there she blow\nThere she blew\nThen send her back to you (hello)\n\n[Hook] - 3X"}}, {"title": "Beware of Us", "album": "Weapons of Mass Destruction", "year": "2004-12-14",

"[Intro: Xzibit]\nYeah, uh, what, worldwide\n\n[Verse 1: Xzibit]\nYeah, I'm forever, ever lastin, spread the wealth\nProcrastination like masturbation, your fuckin yourself\nSo we gonna move on em quickly (what)\nNo chance to think about coming back\nChain smoke em, turn they lungs black\nSee I was raised to love black, but sometimes\nBlack folks wanna sweat you harder than the one-time\nNever participate in dumb, deaf and blind shit\nPlus I got my little man, so daily I'm reminded\nThe ride only gets rougher (right)\nBut I'll be damned if me and my niggas suffer\nSmuggle this motherucker with the raw shit, I'm blessed wit\nLookin at the world, burned for the young and the desperate\nShowed heart, but got cardiac arrested\nMore than a nigga with an image and a press kit\nThe wreck hits, creates desert land, desolate\nThe whole intent to rock the shit, keep the herb lit\n\n[Chorus: Xzibit & (Defari)]\nHandle your business before your business handles you\nMister X to the Z (and Defari Herut), one two\n(Remain true, regardless what we go through)\nYeah, handle your business so you can stand on you're on two\nHandle your business before your business handles you\nMister X to the Z (and Defari Herut), one two\n(Remain true, regardless what we go through)\nYeah, handle your business so you can stand on you're on two\n\n[Verse 2: Defari]\nEveryday I puts in down in LA, hustle in this\nAssassin lyricist, serious, muscle in this\nI call the bets, I know we got coordinates on more games to wreck\nWe blaze shows, never no Half Step\nTactics, B-Boys, no games no antics\nNo false images, no bullshit semantics\nWe planned this, for hundreds of thousands\nReignin' on they brains with lyrics, from the mountains\nDon't contemplate what you can't even demonstrate\nDefari lottery draft pick, never the second rate\nNigga who wanna hate but front like its all great\nI gots no time for these emotional niggas, I gots to motivate\nMoves to make, best rhyme straight\nThat's for the old school, this here's our year, it's time to elevate\nHandle this, don't hesitate got money to make\nPush maximum levels from the Golden State\n\n[Chorus: Xzibit & (Defari)]\nHandle your business before your business handles you\nMister X to the Z (and Defari Herut), one two\n(Remain true, regardless what we go through)\nYeah, handle your business so you can stand on you're on two\nHandle your business before your business handles you\nMister X to the Z (and Defari Herut), one two\n(Remain true, regardless what we go through)\nYeah, handle your business so you can stand on you're on two\n\n[Verse 3: Defari]\nThis combination's high caliber\nHaitians stay amazed and confused like this was algebra\nI'm scoutin the, best land for property\nNever sloppily, picture someone stoppin me\nFrom gettin mine, line after line\nAnd you wonder why I call these fake niggas Miller\nThey think they Genuine; I'm startin to shine, imported Italian\nWith a custom made Herut charm as my medallion\n\n[Verse 4: Xzibit]\nSeem like, I recite the same prayer every night\nWatch my folks, make sure my dogs stay tight\nAnd fully prepared to gunfight in broad daylight\nTill then, lick it to the chin, let it begin\nWe could break bread or break skin; and watch me send it\nTry not to break the law, sometimes I gotta bend it\nAnd my directions, suggest for your own protection\nYou motherfuckers keep it movin like an intersection\n\n[Chorus: Xzibit & (Defari)]\nHandle your business before your business handles you\nMister X to the Z (and Defari Herut), one two\n(Remain true, regardless what we go through)\nYeah, handle your business so you can stand on you're on two\nHandle your business before your business handles you\nMister X to the Z (and Defari Herut), one two\n(Remain true, regardless what we go through)\nYeah, handle your business so you can stand on you're on two\n\n[Outro]\nSerious business *scratched in background*\nFuck you, like that Mr. X to the Z, Defari Herut. Yeah, yeah right? Fuck you, like that Mr. X to the Z, Defari Herut. Yeah, yeah right?\nFuck you, like that Mr. X to the Z, Defari Herut. Yeah, yeah right?\nWhat, keep it movin like this y'all"}}, {"title": "Scandalous Bitches", "album": "Full Circle", "year": "2006-10-17", "lyrics": "She was a brown skin ebony honey that love

shine his light\nAt first he'd gone astray, but now he found his way\nAnd so he shines the brightest in the sky\n\n[Verse 1: Xzibit]\nI designed an oasis, wide open spaces\nButt naked bitches having sexual relations\nMajor operation, let me take conversations\nSensitive intel, pay attention to detail\nYeah, design the flat, not your vital signs\nAC, DC, alkaline, whichever type of battery you got in your back\nGon' be removed when the clips get slapped\nYou and your bitch get slapped, damn, it's good to be back\n\n[Hook]\nSomething more, something more than faith\nSomething more, something more than fairytales\nThe story of a little star, looking for a place to shine his light\nAt first he'd gone astray, but now he found his way\nAnd so he shines the brightest in the sky\n\n[Verse 2: Prodigy]\nMy hip hop is outstanding, outlasting\nAll of these dwarf stars, they fizz a lot fast week\nBurn like the sun and you suck like a black hole\nSuck in my style and get over my flagpole\nThese colors don't run, we attract to\nDrama like madness, you wanna get your head flew\nIncredible bars, I show 'em how to rhyme\nI'm not the average, no in fact I'm\nSuper rap killer, extremely great spitter\nMake a dope, hit a door, solve the queen's riddler\nSinister, ill enough to bang with the sickest\nSo get up and get down with the sickness\nThis is something more than just songs\nI wish upon the stars, pray to God that I come with\nBetter lines than them, to crush their dreams\nAnd attempts at my sport when I do this thing\n\n[Hook]\nSomething more than faith\nThe story of a little star, looking for a place to shine his light\nAt first he'd gone astray, but now he found his way\nAnd so he shines the brightest in the sky\n\n[Verse 3: Xzibit]\nWhat you know about death, money and sacrifice?\nWhat you know about people scheming to take your life?\nI'm tryna tell you, what know about these Cali G's?\nThat mister penitentiary invested movement on a bigger better day\nWhat you know about the harder man?\nWe paint the art of war to decorate the promised land\nYou understand, it's in my nature not to walk away\nCause I'm a beast, my beats'll open up your chest and face\nCall the police, it's not the same and I don't give a fuck\nI speak the truth and now my catalogues are living trust\nNow give it up and get it, take it at gun point\nWe cut-throat niggas in what point\nYou gonna realize we came for\n\n[Hook]\nSomething more than fairytales\nIs a story of a little star, looking for a place to shine his light"}}, {"title": "BK to LA", "album": "Man vs Machine",

We bout to go this motherfuckin club tonight, y'knahmean?\nPoke some motherfuckin hoes, y'knahmean?\nMake sure them hoes, y'knahmean? Gon' act accordingly, y'knahmean?\nSome nigga over there tryin to love one hoe\nY'knahmean? You got one hoe!\nNigga youse a stone motherfuckin Jackson\nNigga youse a stony Jackson, you can't fuck with us\nSo nigga, tuck your tail and hide your hoe nigga\n\n[Jelly Roll]\nWe parked our rides, in front of club\nAll these niggas started givin us love\nSayin I'm the shit, Xzibit you the shit\nJelly Roll get 'em, can I be for real?\nIt's Strong Arm and Jelly Roll, cool for real\nYeah motherfucker, why don't you just chill\nCause I'm just coolin at the spot\nAin't much wrong plus you're makin it hot\nI like shinin from all the grindin\nGirl's best friend, man I'm just like diamonds\nI like khakis and Air Force Ones\nGangsters in the hood with them air force guns\nWe poppin them tags, our pockets fat\nWe fin' to put the world in a shopping bag\nNigga X the man, and I'm the man\nWe tryin to make you love it, don't you understand?\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you're with Strong Arm, you're really down with us\nIf you get high, then get a blunt and roll it up\nYour hood's gon' ride, then let me see you throw it up\nIf you ready I'm ready see really we don't give a fuck\nGet'cha ass up if you're really down with us\nGirl you ain't cute, get on the floor and move your butt\nThe bar is open everybody's gettin drunk\nIf you're ready I'm ready see really we don't give a fuck\n\n[Xzibit]\nAnother night in L.A., the homies all valet\nWe got it lookin the dub show in front of the place\nStrong Arm + 75, we so deep we arrive\nAnd then we swarm like you fucked with the hive\nGotta look a nigga right in the eyes, to tell the truth and the lies\nEven the strong find it hard to survive\nAnother day another dollar we can walk on water\nBetter, drop your tone, you ain't nobody's father\nHotter than about a buck shot your carne asada\nX burn down the town like a path of lava\nPathological drama so we got it inside\nIs it the wine or the women it's so hard to decide\nLook alive it's crackin; this is organized street hustlin\nWith corporate backin promotin interstate traffic (traffic)\nClassic, smash out right\nCause live from Los Angeles it's Saturday Night\n\n[Interlude]\nCause I, can get yo' ass on the floor\nCause this, is this the funk that you want?\nThe hand, it comes way up in the air\nAnd wave 'em all around like you just don't caaaaaaaaare\nBitch, come off of those pots\nStop, shake that junk in your trunk\nSee you, can move this groovyville shit\nThe shake that makes the whollllle club flip\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Xzibit]\nYou might get shot in the face if you don't stay in your place\nYou ain't a soldier like me you a fuckin disgrace\nX move like a shark in the water, I'm dodgin death and disorder\nI'll get you hit it won't cost me a quarter\nI was sent here to strangle and slaughter in no particular order\nYour big mouth might endanger your daughter\nAnother day another digit I'ma speak it and live it\nBetter get yourself a gun 'fore you fuck with Xzibit\nPockets shorter than a midget, you can fuckin forget it\nX green light the target and easily hit it\nGrab the zone and split it so we smokin them woods\nSteady givin niggas the business and keepin it hood\nFirearms we packin, this is military mindstate\nThat's ready for action we mercenaries and assassins (blastin)\nClashin, smash out right\nCause live from Los Angeles it's Saturday Night\n\n[Jelly Roll]\nLet's hit the club and get it on tonight\nLet's get drunk this is Saturday Night\nJust got paid, shine my chrome up tight\nTime to get it crackin, off the Henn' tonight\nX is here, the gang is here\nJelly Roll production bangin crystal clear\nI've been low, now check my highs\nMillion dollar niggas right before yo' eyes\n\n[Xzibit]\nIn Los Angeles, homey (it's Saturday Night)\nIn Houston, dogg (it's Saturday Night)\nIn Miami, mate (it's Saturday Night)\nIn Atlanta, shorty (it's Saturday Night)\nIn St. Louis, dirty (it's Saturday Night)\nIn New Orleans wodie, yo (it's Saturday Night)\nIn New York City, yo (it's Saturday Night)\nAround the world baby, yo (it's Saturday Night)\n\n[Outro]\nOn some straight motherfuckin pimpin shit, y'knahmean?"}}, {"title": "Positively Negative", "album": "At the Speed of Life", "year": "1996-10-15", "lyrics": "[Verse 1: King Tee]\nNow let me introduce whose first\nThe nigga that's been down\nWith the set since birth\nWhatever it was worth\nI checked in on the norm\nSince a juvenile callin'\nShots in the dorm\nMoms said you better get right\nOr shake the spot\nI chose to break and be a rollin' stone\nLike pop\nStashin' the rocks by the gats\nWith the Gs\nSo I can talk crazy when the narks yell freeze!\nI don't fight the feelin'\nGotta hustle with a passion\nComin' cross state to put you down\nWith some action\nIn actuallity I keeps it real in the streets\nRemininsin' younger days\nOver gangsa ass beats\nAnd I\nHit the weed\nTil myeye balls bleed\nWhile my life is corrupted\nBy lust and greed\nServe you anything from cocaine\nUp to speed\nI came with the drank\nSo here's five on the weed\n\n[Verse 2: Xzibit]\nSee kids don't belong\nUp in grown folks buisness\nThe Likwit niggas rollin' through with a thickness\nSickness bear witness\nLike tequlla without a chaser\nIt burns going down\nNiggas guarenteed to drown\nLegendary sound\nFrom the west coast underground\nThe mighty King Tee\nAnd Mr. X to the Z, see\nNever underestimate the power\nOf the X man\nDismantle your plans\nOr just catch you with a back hand\nXzbit bring it to you live\nWith the know how\nCool in a gang\nAnd ain't about to change\nMy lifestyle\nCatchin' bodies in this uphill battle\nBut Xzibit unravel\nHave smoke will travel\nI bust Teflon rhymes\nInto the crowd, bitch\nYou anin't Steve Rif\nSo stop trying to get Loud\nYou need to pump your brakes to avoid the collision\nXzibit still winnin'\nUnanimous decisions\n\n[Verse 3: King Tee]\nIt's going down\nOnce again everybody lay down\nRun your money and the jewels\nTo the front without a sound\nThe infamous supreme King Tee\nGlad to meet ya\nDerranged in the mothafuckin' brain\nThrough ya speaka and hey\nI walk around the hood lookin' looped\nStrapped like a mothafuckin'\nDesert strom troop\nNiggas be like \"King Tila\nHow you get that Benz?\"\nBy sending birds to Oklahoma City\nTo my friends\nI slang my gangsta funk\nThrough the night\nSometimes I fight\nLike I'm the ghost of Eric Wright\nCompton is where I dwell\nIt's like hell\nSlangin' the shit that got the smokers\nIn a spell\nAnd all my homies live lives\nLike crooks\nRich and infamous\nHoes wanna look but get shook\nCause we don't trust you hoes\nYou'll have a nigga fucked up\nWith a bullet through his clothes\nPositively nothings positive\nNegativity positively how we live\nPositively nothings positive\nNegativity positively how we live\n\n[Verse 4: Xzibit]\nLadies and gentlemen\nUndivided attention\nXzibit get you open like Nicole Brown Simpson\nIt's the...\nMost dangerous things next to grizzles\nUnsolved mysteries\nXzibit hit you penetentary style\nQuick sharp and straight to the neck\nI'm heavy on your chest\nI'm all up in your life\nLike stress\nThe coast that resides to your left\nWhre niggas perpitrate\nAnd catch a fate worse than death\nAnd like Cyanide I'm hard to detect\nGot more desighns and stragiht lines\nThan an architect\nKing Tee chapter four\nVerse seven reads\nXzibit shall come and break down humanity\nNiggas lose ther're sanity\nTrying to handle me\nDysfunctional member of the Alkaholik family", "image":

Gs\nSo I can talk crazy when the narks yell freeze!\nI don't fight the feelin'\nGotta hustle with a passion\nComin' cross state to put you down\nWith some action\nIn actuallity I keeps it real in the streets\nRemininsin' younger days\nOver gangsa ass beats\nAnd I\nHit the weed\nTil myeye balls bleed\nWhile my life is corrupted\nBy lust and greed\nServe you anything from cocaine\nUp to speed\nI came with the drank\nSo here's five on the weed\n\n[Verse 2: Xzibit]\nSee kids don't belong\nUp in grown folks buisness\nThe Likwit niggas rollin' through with a thickness\nSickness bear witness\nLike tequlla without a chaser\nIt burns going down\nNiggas guarenteed to drown\nLegendary sound\nFrom the west coast underground\nThe mighty King Tee\nAnd Mr. X to the Z, see\nNever underestimate the power\nOf the X man\nDismantle your plans\nOr just catch you with a back hand\nXzbit bring it to you live\nWith the know how\nCool in a gang\nAnd ain't about to change\nMy lifestyle\nCatchin' bodies in this uphill battle\nBut Xzibit unravel\nHave smoke will travel\nI bust Teflon rhymes\nInto the crowd, bitch\nYou anin't Steve Rif\nSo stop trying to get Loud\nYou need to pump your brakes to avoid the collision\nXzibit still winnin'\nUnanimous decisions\n\n[Verse 3: King Tee]\nIt's going down\nOnce again everybody lay down\nRun your money and the jewels\nTo the front without a sound\nThe infamous supreme King Tee\nGlad to meet ya\nDerranged in the mothafuckin' brain\nThrough ya speaka and hey\nI walk around the hood lookin' looped\nStrapped like a mothafuckin'\nDesert strom troop\nNiggas be like \"King Tila\nHow you get that Benz?\"\nBy sending birds to Oklahoma City\nTo my friends\nI slang my gangsta funk\nThrough the night\nSometimes I fight\nLike I'm the ghost of Eric Wright\nCompton is where I dwell\nIt's like hell\nSlangin' the shit that got the smokers\nIn a spell\nAnd all my homies live lives\nLike crooks\nRich and infamous\nHoes wanna look but get shook\nCause we don't trust you hoes\nYou'll have a nigga fucked up\nWith a bullet through his clothes\nPositively nothings positive\nNegativity positively how we live\nPositively nothings positive\nNegativity positively how we live\n\n[Verse 4: Xzibit]\nLadies and gentlemen\nUndivided attention\nXzibit get you open like Nicole Brown Simpson\nIt's the...\nMost dangerous things next to grizzles\nUnsolved mysteries\nXzibit hit you penetentary style\nQuick sharp and straight to the neck\nI'm heavy on your chest\nI'm all up in your life\nLike stress\nThe coast that resides to your left\nWhre niggas perpitrate\nAnd catch a fate worse than death\nAnd like Cyanide I'm hard to detect\nGot more desighns and stragiht lines\nThan an architect\nKing Tee chapter four\nVerse seven reads\nXzibit shall come and break down humanity\nNiggas lose ther're sanity\nTrying to handle me\nDysfunctional member of the Alkaholik family"}}, {"title": "Up Out The Way", "album": "Napalm", "year": "2012-09-04",

my name will live on\nWhen everybody thought that I was insane\nI stood tall after all that have came\nSo let the good Lord call on my name\n\u2018Cause I done rep I\u2019m working the game\n\n(Hook-Ea$y Money & Xzibit)\nWe never die\nNever die!\nWe just live on\nLive on, live on\nWe never die\nNever die!\nWe just live on\n\n(Xzibit)\nYea, I\u2019m a cowboy steppin clear\nWith a pistol pointblank behind your right ear\nYea because fear is not a option\nSay my name 3 times \u2013 I appear with a shotgun\nNow what you motherfuckers want from me?\nI\u2019m from the gutter, I\u2019m medicated by drug money\nTake everything, there ain\u2019t nothing else you could take from me\nNever break from you niggas, swinging until my hands bloody\nTime flies, dreams die, people lose faith\nTryna hide behind a lie with a straight face\nBuzz kill, boots on the ground \u2018cause I\u2019m straight lace\nFuck love, never needed love in the first place\n\n(Hook-Ea$y Money & Xzibit)\nLegends never... die...\nNever die!\nWe just live on\nLive on, live on\nWe never die\nNever die!\nWe just live on\n\n(B-Real)\nSo many doubted so little time\nSo many haters coming to mind\nLater for waste \u2018cause moments to bind\nBecause I would never look back and regretted this fucking life\nAround, I do it for the ones who supported the dream\nAnd making every second of their life as a part of my team\nIt take the heart of a lion, the crown of a king\nBring up a throne and you keep the frame in mind but you singing my songs\nStill serial kill the bullshit, spit up the thrills\nAnd if you will, you\u2019re not the killer, for real I be dealing\nThe run of the mill, with no skill, top Billy the dun\nThat\u2019s why I reply\n\n(Hook-Ea$y Money & Xzibit)\nLegends never... die...\nNever die!\nWe just live on\nLive on, live on\nWe never die\nNever die!\nWe just live on\n\n(Xzibit)\nYea, I was born to live forever\nI am legend, gather my thoughts and line em up together\nFeel like pulling my own Beretta put it to my head\nBetter days ahead, left for dead with my daily bread\nYea, I\u2019ll cause a slaughter in your tabernacle\nI storm your castle and guillotined your queen\nLos Angeles to the rotten apple\nI\u2019m playing tackle\nGiving concussions cold like going to war with the Russians\nStarving like my ribs and my stomach is touching\nI\u2019m filthy as a pig, all this drinking and fuckin\nIt\u2019s just my destiny til the death of me, stand and deliver\nConfessions of an unapologetic serial killer\n\n(Hook)\nLegends

laugh inside\nNiggas always perpetrating like they down to ride\nBut please don't try to tell me what I can not see\nWhat's the real definition of a fake MC?\nMuthafuckas only rapping since '93 and expect all props\nThem gettin dropped like hot rocks\n\"So stop what they doing cause I'm about to ruin\"\nLike Shock-G, get turned to stone tryin to rock me\nI separate my thought process from stress, 24 tracks inside my brain\nTyrin to maintain\nI bang shit without no gang or Jherri curls\nI seem like Kadeem in a whole different world\nIt's the girls the cars niggas lose themselves, forgettin who they are\nWhen they try to be that superstar\nYou don't understand, it's all in the game plan, exploit the art\nAnd watch hip-hop fall apart\nBut I'ma do my part, and stay true\nAnd keep breaking down bitch niggas like you\n\n[Verse 2: Hurricane Gee & Xzibit]\nI'm not the type to play games or drop names\nI just maintain and burn rappers out the frame\nDoin my part to stay true\nAnd keep breaking down bitch niggas like you\nAnd above all else, I represent it for myself, leavin muthafuckas stretched out\nOr better yet X-ed out\nXzibit accelerate, I rush it to the extreme like nicotine\nNever get me clean from your bloodstream\nWe all can't bust, so do it how you must\nBut if you hustle, avoid gettin rushed with handcuffs plus\nIn God we trust but don't trust us\nWe just add to the ashes, then pick up the dust\n\n[Verse 3: J-Ro & Xzibit]\nLike that I make it seem like you having bad dreams\nHave you wakin up out your sleep by your own screams\nXzibit has arrived Goddamit\nWe bout to rock the whole planet, and bitch niggas can't stand it\nTry to play the back and look intense, you need to hit a fence\nYou don't want none of this hands-on experience\nI'm no the type to play games or drop names\nI just maintain and drop rappers out the frame\n\n[Verse 4: Hurricane Gee]\nI bring it to the ruffest toughest mic killers\nAnd you wannabe niggas\nAnd you burn bitches, type vicious\nImitating Hurricane flow for riches\nYou don't know the half, I got the ill vocab\nDoobie rap style getting bucked\nMore freaky than your last good fuck\nMilkin you like ba ba pieces\nMeetin niggas lyrical wishes\nWritin rhymes and washin out dishes\nFlowin with the Likwid, wicked\nRepresentin' with my nigga Xzibit\nAnd we gonna do it, and do it, and do it\nAnd do it till you satisfied!\nCause shit is tight\nBodiqua C.E.O. on the mic\nSmashin and trashin', fuck Moschino fashions\nAll you muthafuckas need to stop askin\nValued more than the chrome on your last set of

don't try to tell me what I can not see\nWhat's the real definition of a fake MC?\nMuthafuckas only rapping since '93 and expect all props\nThem gettin dropped like hot rocks\n\"So stop what they doing cause I'm about to ruin\"\nLike Shock-G, get turned to stone tryin to rock me\nI separate my thought process from stress, 24 tracks inside my brain\nTyrin to maintain\nI bang shit without no gang or Jherri curls\nI seem like Kadeem in a whole different world\nIt's the girls the cars niggas lose themselves, forgettin who they are\nWhen they try to be that superstar\nYou don't understand, it's all in the game plan, exploit the art\nAnd watch hip-hop fall apart\nBut I'ma do my part, and stay true\nAnd keep breaking down bitch niggas like you\n\n[Verse 2: Hurricane Gee & Xzibit]\nI'm not the type to play games or drop names\nI just maintain and burn rappers out the frame\nDoin my part to stay true\nAnd keep breaking down bitch niggas like you\nAnd above all else, I represent it for myself, leavin muthafuckas stretched out\nOr better yet X-ed out\nXzibit accelerate, I rush it to the extreme like nicotine\nNever get me clean from your bloodstream\nWe all can't bust, so do it how you must\nBut if you hustle, avoid gettin rushed with handcuffs plus\nIn God we trust but don't trust us\nWe just add to the ashes, then pick up the dust\n\n[Verse 3: J-Ro & Xzibit]\nLike that I make it seem like you having bad dreams\nHave you wakin up out your sleep by your own screams\nXzibit has arrived Goddamit\nWe bout to rock the whole planet, and bitch niggas can't stand it\nTry to play the back and look intense, you need to hit a fence\nYou don't want none of this hands-on experience\nI'm no the type to play games or drop names\nI just maintain and drop rappers out the frame\n\n[Verse 4: Hurricane Gee]\nI bring it to the ruffest toughest mic killers\nAnd you wannabe niggas\nAnd you burn bitches, type vicious\nImitating Hurricane flow for riches\nYou don't know the half, I got the ill vocab\nDoobie rap style getting bucked\nMore freaky than your last good fuck\nMilkin you like ba ba pieces\nMeetin niggas lyrical wishes\nWritin rhymes and washin out dishes\nFlowin with the Likwid, wicked\nRepresentin' with my nigga Xzibit\nAnd we gonna do it, and do it, and do it\nAnd do it till you satisfied!\nCause shit is tight\nBodiqua C.E.O. on the mic\nSmashin and trashin', fuck Moschino fashions\nAll you muthafuckas need to stop askin\nValued more than the chrome on your last set of wheels, Hurricane\nHere to reign on your brain, just maintain"}}, {"title": "25 to Life (Life Soundtrack)", "album": "LIFE - Music Inspired By the Motion Picture ", "year": "1999-03-16", "lyrics": "[Intro: Wyclef Jean]\nYo to my people doing time, Xzibit, Juvenile, y'all need to\n[Wake up everybody] Nature, Ja Rule, Reptile come on\nBring the heat\n\n[Verse 1: Xzibit]\nLook, I'm inhumane livin' in this house of pain\nStuck with a thousand street hustlers\nDown on they luck\nRepeat felons caught up with the death I was sellin'\nAnd for the past three months yo I can still hear my victims yellin'\nBut I can't listen to my conscience it's nonsense\nIf I didn't shoot I'd be the nigga in the suit in the box under the ground\nFox chased by the hound locked permanent frown Xzibit get down\nBy liftin' iron by the pound for the tough individual\nRunnin' run his mouth throw some hands with the General\nWalk one day in the shoes of a criminal\nDeath disease keep your luxuries to a minimal\nI'm not talkin' about weed, jewels, & Bentleys\nI'm talkin' about clean clothes, hot food, and Dentyne\nSee what I mean livin' with the scum of the earth\nHit with plenty of time to adjust to life on the inside\n(Wyclef) [For every rhyme I write get 25 to Life]\n\n[Verse 2: Juvenile]\nYou got me fucked up I'm innocent\nLook I ain't do shit you don't want to hear my side\nBut you believin' that bitch\nYou makin' my nerves bad I need to smoke me a jo'\nCause I know y'all ain't even thinkin' 'bout lettin' me go\nWhere my lawyer, nigga told me Juv' I can't do nothin' for ya\nY'all go tell that to my mother & my father\nBut they gon' cuss ya out so don't you even bother\nYou know that shit ain't right that bitch didn't see nothin'\nCause it was dark at night but I guess us blacks\nLook the same to y'all passin' niggas around like a game of ball\nThis is my third felony plus my third strike\nMan I ain't goin' home I got 25 to Life\n[For every rhyme I write get 25 to Life]\n\n[Verse 3: Nature]\nQU New York, you try to criticize me I criticize you\nBeen the same muthafucka since in high school\nAny beat I shed light to with crazy wattage\nBlankin' out bought my first eight ball for eighty dollars\nLearned who not to trust grew obnoxious\nSo niggas start to hate me same time the boys in blue watch us\nCirclin' but they don't slow down take you to court\nThink you seein' Judge Joe Brown they just actin'\nNiggas throwin' Tyson back in another year\nFuckin' with a nigga's career I cock back at you bust in the air\nGive me space beats with plenty bass drink my Hennessey straight\n'til I hurl out third world clout I'll take niggas hearts\nAnd turn killers into girl scouts works of art\nPicasso from the Hydro roller-slash-hustler CEO-slash-retired soldier\n[For every rhyme I write get 25 to Life]\n\n[Verse 4: Ja Rule]\nKill or be killed behind the wall 40 day short\nStill the thought of murderer true to the sport\nI bang with the best in niggas career criminals\nNow I'm in with these youngins lookin' to feel me out\nHollerin' 'bout how they gon' hit on me now\nNiggas is real wild bangin' before trial\nNew case, new trial, I don't give a fuck\nI'm playin' the yard ox taped to my nuts\nReady to self destruct Lord I don't wanna die\nBut what powered your honor to hit me with 25 fuck 'em\nI know that real recognize every hustle\nAnd die with they niggas in the struggle, ya feel me?\n\n[Verse 5: Reptile]\nOh God shells loaded in the semi auto quoted\nUnknown cat never voted picture me on the scene\nHuntin' for greens like Mike Meyers trick or treatin' on Halloween\nMashed down in fatigues servin' the fiends\nKill or be killed metal pipes under the sleeve\nIn the city slicker bust checks or puff cess\nRuffneck love liquor & act figures bloodsport on the streets\nNo gloves pullin' knives out the 'fridge handin' out cold cuts\nUgh streets real thug so recognize thug close yo' eyes thug\nYou 'bout to die thug!\nCall the President I'm blowin' up ya residence\nSpill acid on the corpse to clear the evidence\nProtestors outside screamin' free Gotti\nGuard your body SWAT teams is waitin' with the shotty\n\n[For every rhyme I write get 25 to Life]\nWyclef: Y'all need to [wake up everybody]\n\nFor all my people doin' time keep your head up\nWyclef Jerry \"Wonder\" New Millenium new millenium come on", "image":

to\n[Wake up everybody] Nature, Ja Rule, Reptile come on\nBring the heat\n\n[Verse 1: Xzibit]\nLook, I'm inhumane livin' in this house of pain\nStuck with a thousand street hustlers\nDown on they luck\nRepeat felons caught up with the death I was sellin'\nAnd for the past three months yo I can still hear my victims yellin'\nBut I can't listen to my conscience it's nonsense\nIf I didn't shoot I'd be the nigga in the suit in the box under the ground\nFox chased by the hound locked permanent frown Xzibit get down\nBy liftin' iron by the pound for the tough individual\nRunnin' run his mouth throw some hands with the General\nWalk one day in the shoes of a criminal\nDeath disease keep your luxuries to a minimal\nI'm not talkin' about weed, jewels, & Bentleys\nI'm talkin' about clean clothes, hot food, and Dentyne\nSee what I mean livin' with the scum of the earth\nHit with plenty of time to adjust to life on the inside\n(Wyclef) [For every rhyme I write get 25 to Life]\n\n[Verse 2: Juvenile]\nYou got me fucked up I'm innocent\nLook I ain't do shit you don't want to hear my side\nBut you believin' that bitch\nYou makin' my nerves bad I need to smoke me a jo'\nCause I know y'all ain't even thinkin' 'bout lettin' me go\nWhere my lawyer, nigga told me Juv' I can't do nothin' for ya\nY'all go tell that to my mother & my father\nBut they gon' cuss ya out so don't you even bother\nYou know that shit ain't right that bitch didn't see nothin'\nCause it was dark at night but I guess us blacks\nLook the same to y'all passin' niggas around like a game of ball\nThis is my third felony plus my third strike\nMan I ain't goin' home I got 25 to Life\n[For every rhyme I write get 25 to Life]\n\n[Verse 3: Nature]\nQU New York, you try to criticize me I criticize you\nBeen the same muthafucka since in high school\nAny beat I shed light to with crazy wattage\nBlankin' out bought my first eight ball for eighty dollars\nLearned who not to trust grew obnoxious\nSo niggas start to hate me same time the boys in blue watch us\nCirclin' but they don't slow down take you to court\nThink you seein' Judge Joe Brown they just actin'\nNiggas throwin' Tyson back in another year\nFuckin' with a nigga's career I cock back at you bust in the air\nGive me space beats with plenty bass drink my Hennessey straight\n'til I hurl out third world clout I'll take niggas hearts\nAnd turn killers into girl scouts works of art\nPicasso from the Hydro roller-slash-hustler CEO-slash-retired soldier\n[For every rhyme I write get 25 to Life]\n\n[Verse 4: Ja Rule]\nKill or be killed behind the wall 40 day short\nStill the thought of murderer true to the sport\nI bang with the best in niggas career criminals\nNow I'm in with these youngins lookin' to feel me out\nHollerin' 'bout how they gon' hit on me now\nNiggas is real wild bangin' before trial\nNew case, new trial, I don't give a fuck\nI'm playin' the yard ox taped to my nuts\nReady to self destruct Lord I don't wanna die\nBut what powered your honor to hit me with 25 fuck 'em\nI know that real recognize every hustle\nAnd die with they niggas in the struggle, ya feel me?\n\n[Verse 5: Reptile]\nOh God shells loaded in the semi auto quoted\nUnknown cat never voted picture me on the scene\nHuntin' for greens like Mike Meyers trick or treatin' on Halloween\nMashed down in fatigues servin' the fiends\nKill or be killed metal pipes under the sleeve\nIn the city slicker bust checks or puff cess\nRuffneck love liquor & act figures bloodsport on the streets\nNo gloves pullin' knives out the 'fridge handin' out cold cuts\nUgh streets real thug so recognize thug close yo' eyes thug\nYou 'bout to die thug!\nCall the President I'm blowin' up ya residence\nSpill acid on the corpse to clear the evidence\nProtestors outside screamin' free Gotti\nGuard your body SWAT teams is waitin' with the shotty\n\n[For every rhyme I write get 25 to Life]\nWyclef: Y'all need to [wake up everybody]\n\nFor all my people doin' time keep your head up\nWyclef Jerry \"Wonder\" New Millenium new millenium come on"}}, {"title": "Rimz & Tirez", "album": "Restless", "year": "2000-12-12", "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Defari]\nTake a chance, come dance with a cowboy\nPlayin stopped playing long time ago with childish toys\nIt's only men in here; deuce deuce inch Pirelli\nAnd Goodyear niggas, sip malt liquor beer\nThey gave me sixth man of the year, came off the bench for Tha Liks\nShot the lights out at the championship\nBig chips, big trips, new fits, my money clip's\nFull of green cheese, my other pocket got green weed\nRap niggers, we different individuals\nElevate the level of the music and the visuals\nIt's do or die, I need a Priest, call Soopafly\nWhatever we discuss when we meet's between you and I\nI'm truly high, red-eyed for the red-eye flight\nFive hours, eight drinks, I rode all night, shit\nEveryday, every night's a saloon\nCrime blitty, good bottle, million dollar tunes\n\n[Hook: Kokane]\nLove when when you're out there on the ave\nWhen you're down 24/7, niggas don't know the half\nMy Romeo's step down on the pedal\nMy back keeps on scraping the metal\nI be coasting and be coasting, hitting three wheel motion\nWith my rimz and tirez\n\n[Verse 2: Xzibit]\nI ain't never seen Kevlar flesh (hell naw)\nY'all bitch niggers is flirting and fuckin with death\nI was taught to stick with the right and work with the left\nNever love nothing, never turn snitch and confess\nGotta catch me in the heat of the act, and run the risk\nOf catchin three to the back, and try walking with that (yeah!)\nI ain't goin to the pimp for shit, except to snatch up\nMy loved ones to get loose and hop the fence\nIt ain't hard to look hard, snatch up a catalogue\nMad dog to niggers that walk up your boulevard (yeah!)\nBut one day, you gon' feel it (what?)\nI'm a firm believer in the theory if it bleeds, I can kill it\nA hit man for hire (yeah!) caught up in the crossfire\nThe live wire, leak a nigga like a vampire\nMy empire roll rimz and tirez\nEither get with us, forget us and get behind us, motherfucker\n\n[Hook]\n\nRide along, with my rimz and tirez\nSide along\n\n[Verse 3: Goldie Loc]\nMr. Recycler (what?) I'm looking for a sixty-two Chevy\nAnd she kinda bad, threw him six and I was ready\n(Whatchu want me to do?) To get spic and span\nMan I'm glad you came and got me from that old white man (good looking)\nHe took me to a spot in Long Beach, hooked me up with four pumps\n(bzzt) but everybody in the hood can't jump (bzzt)\nAnd I change colors when the sun hit me\nFix me up, now my owner wanna slang me for 50?\nBling bling, now I belong to a Japanese\nAnd they was quick to throw me in the magazines\nI make money (huh?) I never broke down, fools tripping\n(Check it out) How many cars you see in Seoul on streets dipping?\n(None) Afraid to get that ass caught slipping (why?)\nFor me it was an easy task\nI kept an engine on my ass with heat under the dash\nFool (peep game) I was born to low ride on rimz and tirez, yeah\n\n[Hook]", "image":

"[Verse 1: Defari]\nTake a chance, come dance with a cowboy\nPlayin stopped playing long time ago with childish toys\nIt's only men in here; deuce deuce inch Pirelli\nAnd Goodyear niggas, sip malt liquor beer\nThey gave me sixth man of the year, came off the bench for Tha Liks\nShot the lights out at the championship\nBig chips, big trips, new fits, my money clip's\nFull of green cheese, my other pocket got green weed\nRap niggers, we different individuals\nElevate the level of the music and the visuals\nIt's do or die, I need a Priest, call Soopafly\nWhatever we discuss when we meet's between you and I\nI'm truly high, red-eyed for the red-eye flight\nFive hours, eight drinks, I rode all night, shit\nEveryday, every night's a saloon\nCrime blitty, good bottle, million dollar tunes\n\n[Hook: Kokane]\nLove when when you're out there on the ave\nWhen you're down 24/7, niggas don't know the half\nMy Romeo's step down on the pedal\nMy back keeps on scraping the metal\nI be coasting and be coasting, hitting three wheel motion\nWith my rimz and tirez\n\n[Verse 2: Xzibit]\nI ain't never seen Kevlar flesh (hell naw)\nY'all bitch niggers is flirting and fuckin with death\nI was taught to stick with the right and work with the left\nNever love nothing, never turn snitch and confess\nGotta catch me in the heat of the act, and run the risk\nOf catchin three to the back, and try walking with that (yeah!)\nI ain't goin to the pimp for shit, except to snatch up\nMy loved ones to get loose and hop the fence\nIt ain't hard to look hard, snatch up a catalogue\nMad dog to niggers that walk up your boulevard (yeah!)\nBut one day, you gon' feel it (what?)\nI'm a firm believer in the theory if it bleeds, I can kill it\nA hit man for hire (yeah!) caught up in the crossfire\nThe live wire, leak a nigga like a vampire\nMy empire roll rimz and tirez\nEither get with us, forget us and get behind us, motherfucker\n\n[Hook]\n\nRide along, with my rimz and tirez\nSide along\n\n[Verse 3: Goldie Loc]\nMr. Recycler (what?) I'm looking for a sixty-two Chevy\nAnd she kinda bad, threw him six and I was ready\n(Whatchu want me to do?) To get spic and span\nMan I'm glad you came and got me from that old white man (good looking)\nHe took me to a spot in Long Beach, hooked me up with four pumps\n(bzzt) but everybody in the hood can't jump (bzzt)\nAnd I change colors when the sun hit me\nFix me up, now my owner wanna slang me for 50?\nBling bling, now I belong to a Japanese\nAnd they was quick to throw me in the magazines\nI make money (huh?) I never broke down, fools tripping\n(Check it out) How many cars you see in Seoul on streets dipping?\n(None) Afraid to get that ass caught slipping (why?)\nFor me it was an easy task\nI kept an engine on my ass with heat under the dash\nFool (peep game) I was born to low ride on rimz and tirez, yeah\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "Spread It Out", "album": "Napalm", "year": "2012-10-09", "lyrics":

1: Xzibit]\nI'm heavy hearted, heavy headed, misunderstand it\nTry the permanent repercussions, I empty the cannon\nI'm addicted to ganja, roll it up in a wood\nDrink a gallon of henny, throw it up for the hood\nI'mma rhyme for my people, give my people a voice\nNever follow the leader, use the weapon of choice\nThis is not an illusion, this is not a mirage\nConversation with God, spilling my soul out\nI own assault weapons that fall down like Megatron\nThe iron lung, drop atom bombs on Babylon\nSo tag along like a dog with a vagabond\nSmoke till the sack is gone, niggas on the grind\nPut my motherfucker records on\nSo they can relate to the hate and the pain\nTo the struggle and strain\nNever take it in vain, bring the one and the same\nPress and push your forehead at the back of your brain\nSo now\n\n[Hook: Xzibit]\nLet's spread me out, nigga\nYeah, yeah\nSpread it out, spread it out, spread it out\nIt go: oooo, oooo\n(And you can't get none, you don't want none, you can't get

computer, catch a fatal get shot by a shooter\nA barracuda for Buddha\nI maneuver to the manure, ignore the allure, the illusion\nMy bad, sorry for all the confusion\nIf you thought I was finished, if you thought I was done\nLet the saga continue, bring it back on the one\nI'm coming back with a gun, 'cause that's all that I know\nMeditated intentions, my shit ready to go\nNever taking it slow, in my profession you need aggression\nA weapon, you can brandish at your own discretion\nAnd a hero just a sandwich, nigga, what's your preference?\nI chose ballance and now I'm headed in a right direction\nExecutive decisions, now my family is good\nMake you well understood, put you back where you should be\n\n[Hook: Xzibit]\nLet's spread me out, nigga\nYeah, yeah\nSpread it out, spread it

people who see we're equal\nI feel they come, it is dark, I protect us from evil\nWe've been sold an illusion, cockamamie confusion\nPeople constantly losing, we suffer everywhere\nEnough with all this swagger, party's a baggy bagger\nWe're in recession, we're starving, let me show you what's happenin'\nMoney's so fucking tight, the root to all them fights\nShe make you wanna not ever, not ever come home at night\nBut she know that you go off with that stripping ho\nWhile your woman is wondering where does all your money go\nYou try to make it rain, maybe lock you a chain\nMaybe inducing brain from bitches everywhere\nPussy nigga, you lame, get on top of your game\nFeed your family, man, this is simple and plain\nChildren retain, remember living upon the pain\nThat's when they 'curse

"[Intro: Xzibit]\nHoooooo\nCome on\nHooooooo hooo ho\nSing with me\nYeahhh yeah\nYou don't want none, we got [?] bitch ridin' shotgun\nYeah, spread it out, spread it out, spread it out, go\n\n[Verse 1: Xzibit]\nI'm heavy hearted, heavy headed, misunderstand it\nTry the permanent repercussions, I empty the cannon\nI'm addicted to ganja, roll it up in a wood\nDrink a gallon of henny, throw it up for the hood\nI'mma rhyme for my people, give my people a voice\nNever follow the leader, use the weapon of choice\nThis is not an illusion, this is not a mirage\nConversation with God, spilling my soul out\nI own assault weapons that fall down like Megatron\nThe iron lung, drop atom bombs on Babylon\nSo tag along like a dog with a vagabond\nSmoke till the sack is gone, niggas on the grind\nPut my motherfucker records on\nSo they can relate to the hate and the pain\nTo the struggle and strain\nNever take it in vain, bring the one and the same\nPress and push your forehead at the back of your brain\nSo now\n\n[Hook: Xzibit]\nLet's spread me out, nigga\nYeah, yeah\nSpread it out, spread it out, spread it out\nIt go: oooo, oooo\n(And you can't get none, you don't want none, you can't get none\nSpread the fuck out or catch these hot ones)\n\n[Verse 2: Xzibit]\nI try not to get involved with the nonsense\nI'm from the time where you couldn't post comments\nCouldn't hide behind a computer, catch a fatal get shot by a shooter\nA barracuda for Buddha\nI maneuver to the manure, ignore the allure, the illusion\nMy bad, sorry for all the confusion\nIf you thought I was finished, if you thought I was done\nLet the saga continue, bring it back on the one\nI'm coming back with a gun, 'cause that's all that I know\nMeditated intentions, my shit ready to go\nNever taking it slow, in my profession you need aggression\nA weapon, you can brandish at your own discretion\nAnd a hero just a sandwich, nigga, what's your preference?\nI chose ballance and now I'm headed in a right direction\nExecutive decisions, now my family is good\nMake you well understood, put you back where you should be\n\n[Hook: Xzibit]\nLet's spread me out, nigga\nYeah, yeah\nSpread it out, spread it out, spread it out\nIt go: oooo, oooo\n(And you can't get none, you don't want none, you can't get none\nSpread the fuck out or catch these hot ones)\n\n[Verse 3: Xzibit]\nThis go for all my people, people who see we're equal\nI feel they come, it is dark, I protect us from evil\nWe've been sold an illusion, cockamamie confusion\nPeople constantly losing, we suffer everywhere\nEnough with all this swagger, party's a baggy bagger\nWe're in recession, we're starving, let me show you what's happenin'\nMoney's so fucking tight, the root to all them fights\nShe make you wanna not ever, not ever come home at night\nBut she know that you go off with that stripping ho\nWhile your woman is wondering where does all your money go\nYou try to make it rain, maybe lock you a chain\nMaybe inducing brain from bitches everywhere\nPussy nigga, you lame, get on top of your game\nFeed your family, man, this is simple and plain\nChildren retain, remember living upon the pain\nThat's when they 'curse your name, they will see you do the same\nYeah, so spread me out, nigga\n\n[Hook: Xzibit]\nSpread it out, spread it out, spread it out\nIt go: oooo, oooo\n(And you can't get none, you don't want none, you can't get none\nSpread the fuck out or catch these hot ones)"}}, {"title": "Hit & Run (Part II)", "album": "At the Speed of Life", "year": "1996-10-15", "lyrics": "[Intro:]\n[Hightower:] Baby, do

real tight\nIn a paper Philly Blunts I don't need\nIt might fuck off the taste\nOf this bomb ass weed\nMy nigga Tango and Breeze\nCame thru we blaze a few\nTogether bored as fuck\nNiggas down for whatever\nBreak left from the bomb\nPhone call from Ron Hightower\nShower at his crib in a hour\nAll the women involved drop drawers\nDon't say nothin'\nJust a lota nuttin'\nFuckin' plus dick suckin'\nGoddamn who was that?\nHalf black with the fat ass\nToo much to ask if you can put them on the glass\n(For me)\nMy name's Xzibit\nI ain't' tryin' to spit game\nJust tell me your name\nAnd the proportions of your frame\n(38-26-32)\nThat's right\nXzibit now has it poppin' on Sunday night\n\n[Chorus: (2x)]\nI don't wanna save 'em\nPay em' or buy clothes\nAll we really wanna do\nIs try to fuck

profilactics\nGot ill tactics just to get you on the matress like yo\n[girl moaning in background]\nWith minimal conversation\nNo time wastin'\nOnly hard penetration\nGettin' shiners on recliners\nCummin' in your faces\nStop! Get on top\nI take your mind different places\nWon't be satisfied till I hit every race\nColor and creed in deed\nAll I need is weed a fly steez\nWho ain't afraid to take the lead\nA little dirt on your knees\nLooked over saw Breeze\nLaid out on the couch about to let it all out\nNigga that's the kinda shit that I'm talkin' about\n\n[Chorus: (4x)]\nI don't wanna save em'\nPay em' or buy clothes\nAll we really wanna do\nIs try to fuck these hoes", "image": "https://images.genius.com/49e67f195e584291bc2a980f23cdad07.809x799x1.jpg", "artist": "Xzibit", "raw": {"annotation_count": 1,

stompin' down the concrete\nYEAHHHHHHH, black and blue Bugatti\nThis is Strong Arm robbery, you can't deny me\nMy garage a mirage a collage of chrome\nI look alive with the nine when I leave my home\nBeen on tour in Japan, been relaxed in Rome\nThis is grown man business, recognize the tone\nIf I don't recognize the number won't answer my phone\nRockin' every area code still stay in my zone\nI don't play no fucking games now bitch I'm grown\nNow I crack your fucking neck to the shit I'm on\nYeah!\n\n[Hook]\nSix-four, chromed out, ragtop ROLLIN\nGet your weight up, cause X can't stop

ROLLIN\nGot the Range Rover supercharged, complete with the strut kit\nMy chain hang to my dang-a-lang, what the fuck bitch?\nBoomerang my change, I rearrange some thangs\nMy slang click bang and expose they brains\nThen I pray, our father who art in heaven\nGot people jumpin out the buildin like 9/11\nMalcolm X to the Z landin on them like Plymouth Rock\n(Yeah!) You get knocked out, get socked in your fuckin mouth\nNow e'rybody know the business, you want it come get it (c'mon)\nBut if you ROLLIN throw it up, let me know that you with it\n\n[Hook - 2X]\n\n[Xzibit]\nYEAH, I repeat, my name over beats\nI binge on the finer things you cringe in defeat\nEscalation, elevation to another plateau\nSometimes it take a few steps back to mentally grow\nHere we go, what you know, campaign in motion\nStraight West coast and West worldwide ROLLIN\nGot that Aston Martin DV9 equipped with a stash box\nIn case I ever find myself alone in a tight spot\nStrip down my frame, repave my lane\nInsane with my ink pen, Citizen Kane\nDon't complain when the chamber slide back and bang\nMake it taste like shit when you sayin my name\nIt's the Golden State heavyweight, holdin the belt\nCause I'm a one man army I don't need no help\nThis is a - PISTOL, I use to protect myself\nCareful these hammerhead hollow points is bad for your health\nMy

[T-Pain adlibs]\nY'all know what time it is! But you better stack that money!\n(Awww shit! Ha ha ha ha...)\nFor baaaiiilll....\n\n[Chorus: T-Pain]\nI'm on bail, got that weight for sale\nStrawberries and blueberries all on a nigga's tail\nI'm on bail, bet not 'nare nigga tell... bet not 'nare nigga tell\nYeah!\nI'm on bail, got that weight for sale\nStrawberries and blueberries all on a nigga's tail\nI'm on bail, bet not 'nare nigga tell... bet not 'nare nigga tell\nYeah!\n\n[Verse 1: Daz Dillinger]\nI'm on a two million dollar bail\nCaught with the product that them young niggas sell\nI'm fresh outta cells, twelve hours later.. my clientele hit my pager\nThe situation gettin thick, Dat Nigga Daz is major!\nI live the life of a gangster, I rob gangsters\nTen years up on the table, I deny that flavor\nShe a fighter to the fullest, if I lose I catch a bullet (bullet)\nCan't tell a nigga nuttin when he starvin and losin\nNow I'm back up on the street, completely correctly\nYou disrespect me, it's the same that's it's gon' be\nAutomatics get tragic when you let niggas have it\nThen I'm caught back up like before, I gotta stack my cabbage\nMonday morning, 8:30 right back in court\nCouple of homeboys, my momma give me full support\nRaised up filthy but the Lord be with me\nLike an addict, it's the verdict and the jury, \"NOT GUILTY!!!\"\n\n[Chorus: T-Pain]\nI'm on bail, got that weight for sale\nStrawberries and blueberries all on a nigga's tail\nI'm on bail, bet not 'nare nigga tell... bet not 'nare nigga tell\nYeah!\n\n[Verse 2: Xzibit]\nThey used to have me on that paperwork\nCause I used make my paper.. work, lifestyle covered with dirt\nSee I was first on my block with .40 caliber Glocks\nSimilarities to my uncut, they ready to rock (ready to rock)\nCause everybody wanna ball, nobody wanna get caught\nOnly the pros and the cons get to stack these knots\nMotherfuckers want that Benz with the millions by the karats\nWhen they fencing all day, they start talkin like a parrot\nInformation they sharing so be cautious where ya walk\nNever pillow talk behind closed doors in the dark\nIt might creep back and bite you, indict you, convict you\nTo a five by nine for a very long time\nFuck droppin dimes, niggas is droppin whole hundreds\nSo the hood's gettin skinny and the one-times love it\nIf I don't go get it, then the next nigga will\nSo I kill at will with my gauge in them killin fields\nYeah!\n\n[Chorus: T-Pain]\nI'm on bail, got that weight for sale\nStrawberries and blueberries all on a nigga's tail\nI'm on bail, bet not 'nare nigga tell... bet not 'nare nigga tell\nYeah!\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nYo X, tell my momma to put the house up, wait, the house cost too much\nTell her to get a hundred grand out the Porsche truck\nIt's just like a house cause I take a bath in it\nGet ass in it and I gotta stash in it\nSmoke hash in it, blueberry chocolate tah\nSmokin chronic make me see shit, like 2Pac alive\nBandana knotted in the front like 2Pac alive\nWalkin out the courthouse spittin on the camera guy\nI bang (Thug Life), but this ain't Death Row\nThis some gangster shit for my niggas down on death row\nExhibit A - watch how I let the tec go\nAnd Exhibit B - burn the rubber on the West coast\n\n[Chorus: T-Pain]\nI'm on

merchandise, came back like Christ\nTo change the game, while y'all niggas remain the same\nClear the lane, comin through like Kobe, you can't hold me\nYou can't stop me, ever since I dropped \"Paparazzi\"\nI done watched the game unfold into some hideous shit\nLike every idiot that can spit be droppin a hit\nI transmit for the convicts, committed, never bullshitted\nShadowbox, detox, my own worse critic\nIt's like tryin to squeeze water from rocks\nI negotiate the neighborhood stops and clean your clock with a Glock\nSick of niggas screamin they hot, but really they not\nBeatin you all to the ground like six L.A. cops\nPut your fist up in the air if you ever been shot\nAnd lived to tell about it, never leavin home without it, c'mon\n\n[Hook: Butch Cassidy]\nThere's no one out there, for us, to fear\nI'll say it loud and clear..\nWho can say they're close, to us\nSpeak now and you'll be brought, to tears\n\n[Verse 2: King Tee]\nThey probably saw me on the 91 East, gettin off on Central\nWith the rag back, lookin like life's so simple\nTela take a loss, still floss, all bets\nIf Trife can't cover the house, call X\nLikwit crew brothers, Blues Brothers\nMove somethin, make killers do somethin, f'real\nThe bitch-made often politic with the skill\nNow shit's all twisted, unlisted\nGuns fixed it, best not speak about the Likwit\nWe gifted, twenty-four hours and still lifted\n(*X*: Bitch keep your vagina) We drunk and ain't interested\nBitches come a dime and a dove, we ain't trippin it\nStandin at the bar, soft-styled in the cut\n\"Ooh, boo wait, I think you had too much!\"\nBitch what? Act right and pour it in a cup\nThe West and Eastside keep smokin them blunts, niggas\n\n[Interlude: Butch Cassidy]\nLet's get with it, I was born to trip\nStay on the lookout, ain't no time to slip\nWe ain't for games and shit\nChange your spot, cause we're known to dip\nNo time for chasin hoes\nI'm on a mission cause my cash is low\nThere's no need to speak on those\nDoggy rags are the gangsta's clothes\n\n[Verse 3: Defari]\nThere's two sides of my family, both sides from the ghetto\nPops Finnish choco-late, moms Mississippi yellow\nCaramel, Cherokee black man, with a pedigree of excellence\nTogether we rise, no time for seperateness\nMy grandfather Snake was a Jake, or a jack\nOf a smack to a bird who don't know how to act\nStraight hustler, Mississippi moonshine smuggler\nGood ol' wrangler in his day with that attitude of \"Fuck ya\"\n\n[Verse 4: Xzibit]\nBuilt to run forever, X the infinite\nFirst line of defense to smash through the immigrants\nCan't straddle the fence, it's all or nothin\nClose the curtain, shut down your whole production\nDon't be scared, be prepared, niggas do be bustin\nWithout thinkin; I mastered the art of hard drinkin\nYo, you wanna stop the X, try your best\nI'm still fuckin with your pockets like the IRS, so yo\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Butch Cassidy]\nGather all around, to see\nHow we display our vicious skills\nI done seen and heard, enough\nLet's prove the West coast is for real\n\n.. speak now and you'll be brought to tears .."}}, {"title": "My Life, My World", "album": "Man vs Machine", "year": null, "lyrics": "Ok, alright, alright.

the table and said (\"Yo, where's the rest of it, nigga?\")\nYou gotta love it, came straight to the moneyman\n20,000 cash, neatly stacked, wrapped in rubber bands\nSnatched the whole shit and broke out\nI ran to the living room and got the heat from under the couch\nSmashed out into the middle of the street started blastin' (\"Alright, nigga\")\nDumpin' at the getaway cars but they was mashin'\nI thought I heard the homies just in time for the action\nPolice hit the corner with they reds and white's flashin'\nThese niggas rolled off with at least a cool fifty\nYeah, I'm in handcuffs on the ground and mad 'cause the K-9 bit me\nShipped me off downtown for the bookin'\nThrew my herb sack when the cops wasn't lookin'\nFingerprints, hold the tape, hear come detectors\nOne at the door, another one askin' questions\nStupid shit like, \"Who was I shootin' at?\nWas it gang related and where do they kick it at?\"\nBut I didn't say shit\nI can tell from all the people involved it was an inside job\nBut I'm the wrong nigga to rob, I'll hunt you down\nFuck the money, I'll take you off and accept the loss\nSet bail at fifteen G's, no sweat\nGot cars slippin' tonight, and almost got wet\nHomies come to set bail see, but that's all right\nSince I'm already here I'ma spend the night\n\n[Outro]\nHey, hey I need to use the phone again\n*Car horns*\nAy, ay man\nSince when did you start takin shoestrings and shit?\nMan, ahh\nDo I look like I wanna kill?\nAyy man, fuck that\nAyy, look... I just need to use the phone real quick man, eh, fuck it\nAight, ayy, let me get the top bunk\nAyy man, this, this, this blanket, this blanket smell like urine, man"}}, {"title": "I Came To Kill",

bitch ass nigga\nI should sock you in your motherfuckin' mouth\nTalkin' all this shit about my homie\nSo I chirped him (chirp-chirp)\nHey cuz, this nigga talkin' all this shit right?\nBoom, the homie came up and was like\n\"Nigga say that shit in my motherfuckin' face\"\nPopped him dead in his motherfuckin' mouth nigga\nNiggas be talkin' all this shit\nThe only thing I wanna know is, look\n\n[Hook: Don Blaze (Kurupt)]\nSee when the drama pop off, then pardon me, it ain't my fault\nMy back was up against the wall... thanks to y'all\n(Niggas talkin' like bitches)\nYou need to say it to my face if you got somethin' to say bout me\nCause that's the way it's supposed to be... but you ain't no G\n(Niggas talkin' like bitches) Wishin' you could be like me\n\n[Xzibit]\nSometime men gossip more than women\nYou do too good in Cali the prey start to turn to venom\nYou can't walk in these shoes nigga, you can't fit 'em\nI'm bout five seconds away from the \"let's go get him\"\nSo nigga (say it to my face) if you're feelin' like King Kong\nMysery love company, I guess I'ma leave y'all\nUntil that day, you wanna tuck them nuts\nAnd try to hit my switches and get your frame fucked up\nYou gotta (say it to my face), I'm right here with a 12-gauge\nYou talkin' to a man that plan on dyin' of old age\nUntil that day, I crush everything in my way\nAnd give a fuck about what y'all say\n\n[Hook: Don Blaze (Kurupt)]\nSee when the drama pop off, then pardon me, it ain't my fault\nMy back was up against the wall... thanks to y'all\n(Niggas talkin' like bitches)\nYou need to say it to my face if you got somethin' to say bout me\nCause that's the way it's supposed to be... but you ain't no G\n(Niggas talkin' like bitches) Wishin' you could be like me\n\n[Xzibit]\nToo much of anything makes you a addict\nWantin' contact with another man makes you a faggot\nPatience is virtue, don't make me hurt you\nI came full circle, about-face reversal\nSalute the general, make yourself presentable\nAnalytical, every move made political\n(Say it to my face) and wake up in a hospital\nHuh, gutter never takin' me under\nFuckin' nerve of you motherfuckers\nThinkin' I was slippin', I was servin' you motherfuckers\nX went off the deep end, I'm determined you motherfuckers\nSo watch how you speakin'\nCause I'm listenin' closely for any pussy approachin' me\n\n[Hook: Don Blaze (Kurupt)]\nSee when the drama pop off, then pardon me, it ain't my fault\nMy back was up against the wall... thanks to y'all\n(Niggas talkin' like bitches)\nYou need to say it to my face if you got somethin' to say bout me\nCause that's the way it's supposed to be... but you ain't no G\n(Niggas talkin' like bitches) Wishin' you could be like me\n\n[Xzibit]\nNigga, you better come with the Taliban\nNever been a slave or afraid of another man\nX move like the brutal force of an avalanche\nIt ain't my fault you smoked off your chance\nSee motherfuckers envy what they cannot be\nMr. X to the Z, H.N.I.C\nShh, half assed niggas gon' shit on me\nIf they sentence me to five I'll be out in three\nYou'll be deep in the dirt for the bugs to eat\nTucked in for eternity, time to sleep\nTil' that day, I'll crush everything in my way\nAnd give a fuck about what y'all say\n\n[Hook: Don Blaze (Kurupt)]\nSee when the drama pop off, then pardon me, it ain't my fault\nMy back was up against the

talkin' like bitches) Wishin' you could be like me\n(Niggas talkin' like bitches)\n\n[Outro: Kurupt]\nAll that yackin' don't do shit\nDogg Pound homie... the homie Xzibit\nKurupt Young Gotti... Bigg Snoop... we here\nDaz Dillinger... nickels and nines homie\nLook back..."}}, {"title": "Let It Rain", "album": "40 Days & 40 Nightz", "year": "1998-08-25", "lyrics": "[Intro: Skit]\nJudge: Alright, your charged with public intoxication.
