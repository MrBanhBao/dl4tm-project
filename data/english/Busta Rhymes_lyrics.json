Click, (Blow!)\nStop traffic, dropping them classics, flip now\nBitches, I\u2019m making them skip with thou\nArt, you don\u2019t really want start, when I growl\n(Rawr, rawr, rawr!)\nLet me come and mop up the knock offs\nWhen I pop off and never stop, 'cause\nWhen we do come through, you better lock doors (Pause!)\nThe wolves wanna eat, peep how they lock jaws\nNo need to cook up the coke, you see we cop raw\nAnd if you ain\u2019t had enough\u2014\nWhat\u2014in the fat fishes of a phenomenal\nFahrvergn\u00fcgen fuck\u2014is going on?\nBack with the B.A Baracus, callous bang, on another song\nI\u2019mma have these niggas nervous\nAnd clipping they nails and dribbling\nAnd witness them, nibble them, like sunflower seed shells\nSee these scales, got my weight up heavy, like three whales\nAnd I shit on these males, till it's stinkin'\nFouler, than a weed smell,nigga, your tree fell\nSee how they Twitter, Facebook and Instagramming an email?\nTalking I'm sick, I got them shook and I bang 'em at retail\nUntil they cripple, see I cook, like I\u2019m slanging a weed sale\nUntil I triple bread, and whoop \u2018em and drag 'em, like females (Sfu-ahe! Gasp!) Oh, see well, these niggas already know\nThe way that I fuck shit up, minus the details, the case is shut\nYour bitch remind me of replacement butt\nKind of an ancient slut, it's going down\nLike she was a basement fuck\nSwell up this shit, like I\u2019m sticking steaks in they gut\nSo gracefully and graciously, I painfully wake niggas up\nRagdolling these niggas, and attacking\nLike apes in the cut, I\u2019m waiting for the taking\nWhile I break niggas neck, like a bracelet (fuck!)\nIt\u2019s kinda like, me having a case in the truck\nAnd drinking \u2018til I\u2019m blasted\nHarassing and erase a nigga (What!?)\nKeeping 'em open and blacking until I\u2019m leaving \u2018em stuck\nAnd got \u2018em happier, than a child in a park chasing a duck\nWhile I\u2019m chasing a buck\nThese funny niggas be chasing they luck\nI be lacing them up, like boots\nWhen I\u2019m pushing they face in the mud\u2014\n(Ahgah!) Missiles I fling, while I spit live wire\n\u2018Til this shit circling back around\nWith more fire for me to melt a brick surfacing back a sound\nWhile I light up shit that'll cause a quick worship\nAnd gather around, it's certain this shit'll splatter cliques\nPainful and make \u2018em scatter (Blink!)\nShameful, the way I shatter (Split!)\nShit apart, it doesn't matter (Rip!)\nYour head up off your shoulders (With)\nBullets bigger, than a boulder\nAnd they break \u2018em and they know it's (Classic!)\nAnd the way it\u2019s going, you could easily get your (ass-kicked)\nSee, me and Shady together; we\u2019re crazy\nLike baking a vomit and rabies cake, like a pastry bitch\n(We that sick!) like I come from Haiti\nI\u2019m suggesting you pay me, don\u2019t make me wanna spaz\n(Al-la-la!) Like I\u2019m a crazy Israeli (Bastards!)\nWhile I bite the beat up, and I'm starting to heat up (Yack!)\nI\u2019m chopping your foot off\nNow it\u2019s mine, and I\u2019m putting my feet up (Black!)\nBack to the hood and off to the wild\nAnd I\u2019m hoping you protect your child\nAnd I been blacking out so long\nNiggas is asking if the hook had died, nah\nBut the beat is fried!\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes + Sample]\nYo\n(Ready on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga\n(Ready on the left) Ayo, calm down, nigga\n(Ready on-)\n(\"Yo, chill, man\u2014chill!\")\n(Ready on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga\n(Ready on the left) Ayo, calm down, nigga\n(Ready on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga\n(Ready on the left) Fuck it, blackout, niggas!\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nApparently, there's a light contagiousness to this tirade\nIt just might make you sick, so irate\nWith this my brain is just like a fucking fried egg\nIs my mind scrambled? 'Cause I'm lit\u2014narrow minded\nBut go through such a wide range of this emotion\nThat my rage has gotta squeeze through it sideways\nI just pulled up, in Clive Davis's driveway\nWith his personal memoir, saying \"He's bi!\"\nWaving a nine, a picket sign, egging his ride\nMaking him cry, \"Rape!\"\u2014then arrive naked\nAnd drive straight through the gay pride parade\n\"Yay! Yippee-Ki-Yay!\", 'cause here I\u2014\nWait, did the world just pee on my leg?\nAnd should I take it as a sign\nMaybe to take 'em back into time? (Shady!)\nI stuck out like a sore thumb, so I gave 'em the finger\nTo take the attention away\nFrom my stinking face it was bringing\nChanged the whole complexion of the game\nBut just in case you was thinking an inkling of replacing\nThe kingpin of crazy, you're wasting your ink then\nSo if this is any indication, of what you may be facing\nYou better make a distinction, 'cause you fake imitations\nAre leaving a bad taste, fuck making a bad impression\nThat's the worst impersonation I've ever seen\nWho raps nasally? Eyes hazely?\nRhymes crazily, but sounds like he may\nNeed some Flonase when he's speaking?\nWhat kind of stupid question is that?\n\"Hey, Mrs. Abraham Lincoln!\nOther than your husband's fucking brains that were leaking\nHow'd you think that play was this weekend?\"\nYou ain't the real Slim Shady, sit your ass down faggot\nSee me on a ballot, I'm running for class clown\nRich Democrat bitch, so I'm just the candidate\nTo come fuck up the whole party\nMe and Flipmode starting a campaign\nTo have every campus, on a fucking rampage\nAct my goddamn age? I am\u2014eight!\nSo let's get smashed and wake up the next day\nWith the room trashed, covered in Band-Aids\nGlass ashtray smashed\nChampagne splashed on the lampshades\nBut this ain't up for debate, this is undebatable\nShady for president ho, don't make me go take it back\nTo the days of old,with Sway & Tech radio\nWhen I was taking so much NoDoz and LSD\nI almost fell asleep on the Wake Up Show\nFuck you telling me, fools?\nI was rippin' shop, raisin' hell up in Drew's\nWhen Penelope Cruz was still developing boobs\nMe and Bus put it down, like a sick pet\nYou're fucking with vets, dog, fucking internet bloggers\n\"I sit in front of my computer all day\nAnd comment on everything, I'm an expert on everything, Everything sucks\u2014play the next song!\"\nGuess if I hopped out your freaking laptop, you idiot prick\nWith Biggie and kicked the living shit out you, I'd be dead wrong\nSon of God; I'm the S.O.G\nLike a wet log, pores never get clogged\n'Cause I'm so full of self-esteem, that I sweat fog\nYes, yes, y\u2019all (Wah!)\u2014steady on the left, y\u2019all\nStep off, 'fore you get stepped on\nSoft? 'Bout as commercial as my fucking Learjet\nJealousy\u2019ll get you green as a Chia Pet\nI can see that you\u2019re visibly upset, dog\nAlert, alert, girl\u2014alert\nOnce you enter in my house of pain, you're in a world of hurt\nSo (\"Jump around! Jump! Jump!\")\nGet that ass shaking (\"Jump around! Jump!\")\nCame to hit you, with a fan favorite\nBut if you too fly for coach better get them arms\nAnd freaking hands flailing and (\"Jump!\")\nLike Van Halen and pray for a damn tailwind\nMore afraid of success, than I am of failure\nSo what does that tell ya?\nThat on a grand scale, I don\u2019t give a fuck about nothing\nLike Stan mailing his last piece of fan mail\nBefore he ran straight into the damn railing\n\n[Outro: Sample]\n\"Yo, chill, man\u2014chill!\"\n\n[Produced by Scoop DeVille]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a2b432c2f6c35eb41ac44513c8d3337b.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist":

'Cause I'm lit\u2014narrow minded\nBut go through such a wide range of this emotion\nThat my rage has gotta squeeze through it sideways\nI just pulled up, in Clive Davis's driveway\nWith his personal memoir, saying \"He's bi!\"\nWaving a nine, a picket sign, egging his ride\nMaking him cry, \"Rape!\"\u2014then arrive naked\nAnd drive straight through the gay pride parade\n\"Yay! Yippee-Ki-Yay!\", 'cause here I\u2014\nWait, did the world just pee on my leg?\nAnd should I take it as a sign\nMaybe to take 'em back into time? (Shady!)\nI stuck out like a sore thumb, so I gave 'em the finger\nTo take the attention away\nFrom my stinking face it was bringing\nChanged the whole complexion of the game\nBut just in case you was thinking an inkling of replacing\nThe kingpin of crazy, you're wasting your ink then\nSo if this is any indication, of what you may be facing\nYou better make a distinction, 'cause you fake imitations\nAre leaving a bad taste, fuck making a bad impression\nThat's the worst impersonation I've ever seen\nWho raps nasally?

Yet, according to the song\u2019s hook, the artists clearly attribute their success, riches, and all the drugs, money and women in their lives to their \u201cheavenly father\u201d whom they thank for everything. This implies that today there is a more post-modern idea of what it is to be a christian and what type of personal relationship you can have with God.

resonates the music, iTune it, YouTube it\nIt could never ever be refuted\nIt's gnarly for niggas and naughty for ninas, bitches and ballerinas\nBallers and in-betweeners, blatant nonbelievers and

preference\nWatch me turn them to skeletons, see how I come and bring out the betterness?\nTime is with it, I rep the foreverness\nFlying United Emirates, sized private plane, that kind of etiquette\nPurchasing diamonds, handle them delicate\nNow you need you a better ref\nYou could peep us regulating, see we all in this bitch like we ain't never left\n\n[Hook: Alicia Myers]\nI want to

album Genesis. The song was produced by Dr. Dre and Scott Storch, while the background vocals were done by Truth Hurts.  The \u201cgive it away\u201d part of the song is interpolated from the Red Hot Chili Peppers song \u201cGive It Away.\u201d\n\nA showcase for Busta\u2019s ability to spit incredibly fast, \u201cBreak Ya Neck\u201d is considered a landmark track for both Busta\u2019s work and speed rap in general. Watsky even used the song\u2019s instrumental for his breakout track, \u201cPale Kid Raps Fast\u201d.\n\nThe general theme of this song goes along the lines of \u201cif you haven\u2019t broken a bone

act up\nEverybody else is incompatible with the artillery\nSo forget about it when you hear about it\nCause it's too fast when I pass the baton to Busta\n\n[Twista and Busta Rhymes]\nHit a victim in the middle of the body with a bullet and a rhythm\nEvery murder is a structure\n\n[Busta Rhymes]\nEvery time I hit you niggers with another jam be blacking\nI be sounding like a nigga full of anger\nNow I'm back to beat you in the head, I'll bring another banger\nWith my nigga Twist, everything we do be up to wanger\nYou don't really, really wanna see the way that I come\nAnd I'll give it to you, get up on the ceiling see a nigga numb\nDo it how I wanna do it 'till I make another nigga drop\nI put my money on it, homie, I'm the one\n\n[Twista]\nGo on here, pick it up, carry it the way you wanna carry it\nDo whatever you wanna do\nShow the competition how we gunning too when we coming through\nBetter never let a nigga never get in front of you\nI wanna be, I wanna pro, wanna get in\nThen racin' so fast, they call me flash\n\n[Twista & Busta Rhymes]\nDon't nobody really wanna\nWe can hit 'em like a couple of millimeters\nWoopin' a niggas' ass\n\n[Busta Rhymes]\nSkibbedy boop, skibbedy bop, skibbedy beep\nI'm skipping all over on another Just Blaze hit\nNow I know a lot of y'all been sitting, waiting and wondering\nWas we ever gonna do this shit\nAnd then we came to hit 'em with another flow\nPop champagne, celebrate and kill another show\nGotta campaign, the greatest niggas, y'all already know that\nNever do this kinda shit, Twista, get 'em, gotta go\nNow I gotta ask y'all\n\n[Hook]\nCan you keep up?\n\n[Verse 2: Twista]\nKill everybody cause I'm gunning outta stress\nIf I'm running outta breath, he gonna pick up where I left off\nKeep him with me when he spitting cause the flow be the bidness\nI'm a menace when I bust a lyrical tec off\nGo faster than Ricky Bobby, kill him in Talladega Nights\n\n[Twista & Busta Rhymes]\nNiggas try to get up, when a nigga hit up\nWhen it I come I promise you gotta pay the price\n\n[Busta Rhymes]\nLook, why don't everybody wanna come and try get a little taste\nOf the shit I got, let me put it all up in your face\nWhen I spit it I got a nigga wilding all over the place\nEverybody better listen here\nCause you know when I bring him I will never, never stop\nMake a nigga rewind and bring it back to the top\nThrow the shit up in the streets and I be running every block\nEverybody better stand clear\n\n[Twista]\nLike a millimeter when I be booking the track up\nMotivated for murder whenever I act up\nA couple of phenomenal niggas can stack up\nGets anybody that wanna live in the back up\nKilling everybody when I bust a clip off\nCause I'mma be attacking them with the insane flow\nThen I be having them calling me Twista Phelps\nAnd my nigga Buss like Usain Bolt\n\n[Busta Rhymes]\nShocked a nigga like I was a thousand volts\nNow I'm feeling on the beat the way I'm feeling on the boat\nThe way I gotta kill 'em and the way I gotta flow\nYou don't really wanna test me, boy, cause I'll pop ya\nWhen I'm in the spot you know you can't leave\nI spit every word 'till, damn I can't breathe\nYou never heard 'till you nosebleed\nTwista, please\nNow you know I got ya\nNow I gotta ask y'all\n\n[Hook]\nCan you keep up?\n\n[Verse 3: Twista]\nYou can talk about it with a bunch of people\nThat say that I'm a lyrical manifestation of rhythm\n\n[Busta Rhymes]\nThen I come and do the shit I gotta do and then I bang \u2018em\nAnd get 'em and do it every single time I hit 'em\n\n[Twista]\nWhen I do it its gotta be accurate\nLike I'm attacking the rhythm with such a vocal tenacity\n\n[Busta]\nSee the way a brother blacking I\u2019m back and infant\nCause every time we in the place you feeling the capacity\n\n[Twista]\nI be coming with it, he be coming with it\nAnd nobody really do it how we do it\nAnd the flow is so fluid I gotta be an anomaly\nGotta be an Odyssey; the prodigy, and I'mma be the one to prove it\n\n[Busta]\nDon\u2019t you ever forget it the way we coming\nAnd they sending somebody, gonna probably be needing a medic\nSo give us the credit and I thought that we should

is incompatible with the artillery\nSo forget about it when you hear about it\nCause it's too fast when I pass the baton to Busta\n\n[Twista and Busta Rhymes]\nHit a victim in the middle of the body with a bullet and a rhythm\nEvery murder is a structure\n\n[Busta Rhymes]\nEvery time I hit you niggers with another jam be blacking\nI be sounding like a nigga full of anger\nNow I'm back to beat you in the head, I'll bring another banger\nWith my nigga Twist, everything we do be up to wanger\nYou don't really, really wanna see the way that I come\nAnd I'll give it to you, get up on the ceiling see a nigga numb\nDo it how I wanna do it 'till I make another nigga drop\nI put my money on it, homie, I'm the one\n\n[Twista]\nGo on here, pick it up, carry it the way you wanna carry it\nDo whatever you wanna do\nShow the competition how we gunning too when we coming through\nBetter never let a nigga never get in front of you\nI wanna be, I wanna pro, wanna get in\nThen racin' so fast, they call me flash\n\n[Twista & Busta Rhymes]\nDon't nobody really wanna\nWe can hit 'em like a couple of millimeters\nWoopin' a niggas' ass\n\n[Busta Rhymes]\nSkibbedy boop, skibbedy bop, skibbedy beep\nI'm skipping all over on another Just Blaze hit\nNow I know a lot of y'all been sitting, waiting and wondering\nWas we ever gonna do this shit\nAnd then we came to hit 'em with another flow\nPop champagne, celebrate and kill another show\nGotta campaign, the greatest niggas, y'all already know that\nNever do this kinda shit, Twista, get 'em, gotta go\nNow I gotta ask y'all\n\n[Hook]\nCan you keep up?\n\n[Verse 2: Twista]\nKill everybody cause I'm gunning outta stress\nIf I'm running outta breath, he gonna pick up where I left off\nKeep him with me when he spitting cause the flow be the bidness\nI'm a menace when I bust a lyrical tec off\nGo faster than Ricky Bobby, kill him in Talladega Nights\n\n[Twista & Busta Rhymes]\nNiggas try to get up, when a nigga hit up\nWhen it I come I promise you gotta pay the price\n\n[Busta Rhymes]\nLook, why don't everybody wanna come and try get a little taste\nOf the shit I got, let me put it all up in your face\nWhen I spit it I got a nigga wilding all over the place\nEverybody better listen here\nCause you know when I bring him I will never, never stop\nMake a nigga rewind and bring it back to the top\nThrow the shit up in the streets and I be running every block\nEverybody better stand clear\n\n[Twista]\nLike a millimeter when I be booking the track up\nMotivated for murder whenever I act up\nA couple of phenomenal niggas can stack up\nGets anybody that wanna live in the back up\nKilling everybody when I bust a clip off\nCause I'mma be attacking them with the insane flow\nThen I be having them calling me Twista Phelps\nAnd my nigga Buss like Usain Bolt\n\n[Busta Rhymes]\nShocked a nigga like I was a thousand volts\nNow I'm feeling on the beat the way I'm feeling on the boat\nThe way I gotta kill 'em and the way I gotta flow\nYou don't really wanna test me, boy, cause I'll pop ya\nWhen I'm in the spot you know you can't leave\nI spit every word 'till, damn I can't breathe\nYou never heard 'till you nosebleed\nTwista, please\nNow you know I got ya\nNow I gotta ask y'all\n\n[Hook]\nCan you keep up?\n\n[Verse 3: Twista]\nYou can talk about it with a bunch of people\nThat say that I'm a lyrical manifestation of rhythm\n\n[Busta Rhymes]\nThen I come and do the shit I gotta do and then I bang \u2018em\nAnd get 'em and do it every single time I hit 'em\n\n[Twista]\nWhen I do it its gotta be accurate\nLike I'm attacking the rhythm with such a vocal tenacity\n\n[Busta]\nSee the way a brother blacking I\u2019m back and infant\nCause every time we in the place you feeling the capacity\n\n[Twista]\nI be coming with it, he be coming with it\nAnd nobody really do it how we do it\nAnd the flow is so fluid I gotta be an anomaly\nGotta be an Odyssey; the prodigy, and I'mma be the one to prove it\n\n[Busta]\nDon\u2019t you ever forget it the way we coming\nAnd they sending somebody, gonna probably be needing a medic\nSo give us the credit and I thought that we should oughta\nBe coming to slaughter so call out the order see the way we do it\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "I'll Hurt You", "album": null, "year": "2006-07-13", "lyrics": "[Intro: Busta Rhymes + Eminem]\nYeah!

to me\nI'll give it to you (give it to me)\nI know what you want\nYou know I got it\nBaby if you give it to me\nI'll give it to you\nAs long as you want\nYou know I got it\nBaby if you give it to me\nI'll give it to you\nI know what you want\nYou know I got it\nBaby if you give it to me\nI'll give it to you\nAs long as you want\nYou know I got it\n\n[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]\nYes you know I'll die for you\nAnd ya know I'll ride with you\nI will always try with you\nAnd give ya my love and cry with you\n\n[Verser 6: Mariah Carey]\nI will climb a mountain high aha\nUntil I was up to touch the sky\nSo baby come and get more close to me\nThis is where your love is supposed to be\n\n[Verse 7 : Rampage]\nI pull up to the house in a yellow Lamborghini\nIt's been a few months in PA you haven't seen me\nYa lookin' good in that Gucci bikini\n38 carats ya ring lookin' freezy\nNo matter what I do in the world you never leave me\nFall back ma I'll make ya lifestyle easy\nI appreciate the things ya do to please me\nLookin' at my daughter you'll never do me greasy\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes, Mariah Carey]\nBaby if you give it to me\nI'll give it to you\nI know what you want\nYou know I got it\nBaby if you give it to me\nI'll give it to you\nAs long as you want\nYou know I got it\nBaby if you give it to me\nI'll give it to you\nI know what you want\nYou know I got it\nBaby if you give it to me\nI'll give it to you\nAs long as you want\nYou know I got it\n\n[Busta Rhymes speaking with Mariah ad-libs]\nFlipmode Records, J Records\nDef Jam Records\nBusta Rhymes...Mariah\nFlipmode Squad, yeah\nSo beautiful\nAh-ha I knew you was gon' give me that high note\nMariah\nAh-ha-ha yeah\n\n[Spoken Outro]", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/e639a17d1406be9302c110d15501b535.300x300x1.jpg",

need\nI promise I ain't gonna hold out neither\nI'mma give it all to you baby\nIt's burnin' on, bust it\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes & (Mariah Carey)]\nBaby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you\nI know what you want, you know I got it\nBaby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you\nAs long as you want, you know I got it\n(Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you)\n(I know what you want, you know I got it)\n(Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you)\n(As long as you want, you know I got it)\n\n[Verse 1: Spliff Star]\nWe been together for a few years, shared a few tears\nCalled each other nicknames like Sugar Plum and Poo Bear\nI'm always on the road, hardly ever home\nAlways busy this busy that can't talk on the phone\nI know you aggrevated, walk around frustrated\nYa patience gettin' short, how longer can you tolerate it\nListen ma I'm just motivated, I do this for us\nStep on the grind tryin' to elevate it now\n\n[Verse 2: Baby Sham]\nHey yo to really be honest\nYou stuck with me through my whole struggle\nCan't even express the words\nHow much the kid loves ya\nI'mma stand as a man never above ya\nI can tell that you different from most\nSlightly approach you\nAnd that ill shit about it\nWe gon' sex every day\nBut when we sex we tease\nIn a passionate way\nI love the way you touch it\nThose little elaborate ways\nGot the god feelin' released\nTo relax for the day\nIt's on you ma\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes, Mariah Carey]\nBaby if you give it to me\nI'll give it to you\nI know what you want\nYou know I got it\nBaby if you give it to me\nI'll give it to you\nAs long as you want\nYou know I got it\nBaby if you give it to me\nI'll give it to you\nI know what you want\nYou know I got it\nBaby if you give it to me\nI'll give it to you\nAs long as you want\nYou know I got it\n\n[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]\nShh, mami listen\nI feel ya love for me baby\nAnd how it move through you\nI been longin' for the moment\nTo talk the truth to you\n(Listen) I'm never home\nI always get up and go\nPuttin' you through the unnecessary rigmarole\nI never meant to put a thousand pounds\nOf stress on ya head\nI love the way we sleep\nAnd how we always cuddle in bed\nBaby, I stay embracin' ya patience\nSheddin' ya tears with me\nI ask you my mami\nPlease continue to bear with me\n\n[Verse 4: Rah Digga]\nWe started out broke\nConstantly on a roll\nCuttin' up in the streets like we would never get old\nWent from looseys and buses to fifty cent sodas\nAnd Novas to Hondas to Lexus to Rovers\nMad years passed\nStill got each other back (oh yeah)\nWord is bond never screw none of these industry cats (boy)\nWe like Scull and Mulder\nWalkin' shoulder to shoulder\nMilkin' this game watchin' our seeds gettin' older\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes, Mariah Carey]\nBaby if you give it to me\nI'll give it to you (give it to me)\nI know what you want\nYou know I got it\nBaby if you give it to me\nI'll give it to you\nAs long as you want\nYou know I got it\nBaby if you give it to me\nI'll give it to you\nI know what you want\nYou know I got it\nBaby if you give it to me\nI'll give it to you\nAs long as you want\nYou know I got it\n\n[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]\nYes you know I'll die for you\nAnd ya know I'll ride with you\nI will always try with you\nAnd give ya my love and cry with you\n\n[Verser 6: Mariah Carey]\nI will climb a mountain high aha\nUntil I was up to touch the sky\nSo baby come and get more close to me\nThis is where your love is supposed to be\n\n[Verse 7 : Rampage]\nI pull up to the house in a yellow Lamborghini\nIt's been a few months in PA you haven't seen me\nYa lookin' good in that Gucci bikini\n38 carats ya ring lookin' freezy\nNo matter what I do in the world you never leave me\nFall back ma I'll make ya lifestyle easy\nI appreciate the things ya do to please me\nLookin' at my daughter you'll never do me greasy\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes, Mariah Carey]\nBaby if you give it to me\nI'll give it to you\nI know what you want\nYou know I got it\nBaby if you give it to me\nI'll give it to you\nAs long as you want\nYou know I got it\nBaby if you give it to me\nI'll give it to you\nI know what you want\nYou know I got it\nBaby if you give it to me\nI'll give it to you\nAs long as you want\nYou know I got it\n\n[Busta Rhymes speaking with Mariah ad-libs]\nFlipmode Records, J Records\nDef Jam Records\nBusta Rhymes...Mariah\nFlipmode Squad, yeah\nSo beautiful\nAh-ha I knew you was gon' give me that high note\nMariah\nAh-ha-ha yeah\n\n[Spoken Outro]"}}, {"title": "Why Stop Now", "album": null, "year":

beast dead\nI got Middle East women and Middle East bread\nI got oil well money in the desert playing golf\nDolce shorts, dashiki with a Louis Scarf\nChest cold, diamonds make a nigga wanna cough\nIn

pieces of the Almanac\nY'all already know, I got the streets buzzin'\nWhile I make you bow down and make Salaat like a Muslim\n\n[Hook: Ron Browz]\nLa ilaha illa Allah, ha la ili, hay yo\nHili

need to get fresh, about to grow a beard duke\nSo much cake even the money look weird too\nDomestic bread, and I'm broad, I'm tryna eat right\nPrince Al-Waleed bin Talal Al Saud\nThey respect the value of my worth in Mali, Malaysia\nIran and Iraq, Saudi Arabia!\n\n[Hook: Ron Browz]\nLa ilaha illa Allah, ha la ili, hay yo\nHili b'Allah, hey, hili bay yo\nWe getting Arab money\nWe getting Arab

my turn\nMy curses been in verses since my firstest brain cells burnt\nBut I done been deferred to assistants and interns\nAnd I done been on hold for some years, it's getting old\nI'm too blessed to fit the mold, they said press six to give your soul\nOr not and you can hold, you ain't never gonna explode\nOr expand across the globe, but look like I just skipped the cold\nHello all up in your ear, you should hear me loud and clear\nWe was not allowed in here, and now we smoking loud in here\nHow we in the game and they ain't put a chain on them\nCleaning in that thing and my Sprite don't got a stain on it\nLil Xan fuck the Chance up, Donnie Trumpet said bands up\nDonnie McClurkin said stand up\nI know contracts are like handcuffs\nI know combat when it's hand to hand or with handguns\nI know answers, I know man to man, can't stand us\nI know exactly how you wanna brand us\nI take campers to the campus fix the trips and get the bus\nFast like Twista mixed with Bust\nWhen Windy lost boys I had pixie dust for a pick me up\nSpit shine 'til it's crystal clean like Listerine from a Dixie cup\nMama Jann band-aid kiss the cut\nNow I'm thinking about offices and mansions with amenities\nAnd runneth over pools and infinities\nAward shows and house wives and games shows and Hennessy\nIt's different from the energy I see being in your vicinity\nMistaken identity, you behaving differently\n(Ayo Chance, don't stop now nigga)\nYou the protest you the marches\nYou on the forefront you the farthest\nYou the melanin in the darkness\nWrong number what a shame\nYou and I look just the same\nThat's why I got you in my name\nLets push it to the masses give them wavy, give them Surf\nOne time shout-out to Bust, I know this a long ass verse\nBut I'm just getting started I'm taking this rap shit global\nPut my music in the museum, put my bars in Barnes and Noble\nShape the office like an oval, make the triangle a circle\nTeach the little boys and girls, tell them I was your referral\nI'm Chicago like a gyro, I'm Chicago like some harolds\nI will borrow from the Boroughs , show tomorrow to the world\nPlace the urban and the rural, make the wall into a Mural\nLead it where it need to be, they jocking like a Nitti beat\nNow they cannot get rid of me, bye, bye to the industry\nLionel Richie is it me? hello?\n\n[Interlude: Chance The Rapper (Busta Rhymes)]\n(Chance The Rapper sing it to 'em)\nIs it me you're looking for?\nGonna find you\nAnd make you want me\n\n[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]\nBust Rhymes it come with the force and lay it across\nHit you like I'm playing lacrosse\nAnd if it was July I'd drop it on the day of the fourth\nThe fire make you bust a shot\nPull a string and get lost\nStinging guitars (Hello)\nI'm here with the floss\nA chain with a frost\nWhile the yellow diamonds shine with a gloss, I'm cold (ah)\nShit heavy like we weighing a horse\nViolate, one shot will turn your brain into sauce\nJust pray I remorse\nNigga you know we whip from the start\nYou slept on the art\nBugging on how we put out your spark\nWe separate the heat from corny shit and kept it apart\nStep on a dart, spit will test the rest of your heart\nNo rest in the dark (hello)\nWe the best of the sharks, we love and we fart\nAnd leave a mark so put it in park\nWhenever we bark, we make you come and get with this nigga\nGet next to this nigga, we past professional\nYou can call me a specialist nigga\nWe fuck shit up while you call me the best at this nigga\nThe way we put it down you'll be calling a censorship nigga\nWe holding a higher rank and we holding it back\nAnd I'm grimey niggas home when they shank\nOr they clickity clank (hello)\nNow just clap from front to back and just react (what?)\nLike you know you posted till you die it is the feeling (what?)\nKeep on clapping get to acting up now keep on packing (what?)\nAll inside (is high) now feel the fire in the building\nYou can never test they way I do it\nAnd the way I be moving my mouth and be\nShaking and shining and breaking em out\nAnd making the noise I be making everytime\nI be hitting a song I keep you waiting\n(Real talk) real shit\nAnd we'll see where y'all coulda come from\nI'll hit you with another mega after the fact\nAnd they want me to go a little quicker\nGet a bit of this then (bududududu) what's faster than that?\n(Hello) And I ain't going no where\nIt's me,

me\nHello rap game, n\u01d0 h\u01ceo, how you durrn'?\nI done took my time, now it's time to take my turn\nMy curses been in verses since my firstest brain cells burnt\nBut I done been deferred to assistants and interns\nAnd I done been on hold for some years, it's getting old\nI'm too blessed to fit the mold, they said press six to give your soul\nOr not and you can hold, you ain't never gonna explode\nOr expand across the globe, but look like I just skipped the cold\nHello all up in your ear, you should hear me loud and clear\nWe was not allowed in here, and now we smoking loud in here\nHow we in the game and they ain't put a chain on them\nCleaning in that thing and my Sprite don't got a stain on it\nLil Xan fuck the Chance up, Donnie Trumpet said bands up\nDonnie McClurkin said stand up\nI know contracts are like handcuffs\nI know combat when it's hand to hand or with handguns\nI know answers, I know man to man, can't stand us\nI know exactly how you wanna brand us\nI take campers to the campus fix the trips and get the bus\nFast like Twista mixed with Bust\nWhen Windy lost boys I had pixie dust for a pick me up\nSpit shine 'til it's crystal clean like Listerine from a Dixie cup\nMama Jann band-aid kiss the cut\nNow I'm thinking about offices and mansions with amenities\nAnd runneth over pools and infinities\nAward shows and house wives and games shows and Hennessy\nIt's different from the energy I see being in your vicinity\nMistaken identity, you behaving differently\n(Ayo Chance, don't stop now nigga)\nYou the protest you the marches\nYou on the forefront you the farthest\nYou the melanin in the darkness\nWrong number what a shame\nYou and I look just the same\nThat's why I got you in my name\nLets push it to the masses give them wavy, give them Surf\nOne time shout-out to Bust, I know this a long ass verse\nBut I'm just getting started I'm taking this rap shit global\nPut my music in the museum, put my bars in Barnes and Noble\nShape the office like an oval, make the triangle a circle\nTeach the little boys and girls, tell them I was your referral\nI'm Chicago like a gyro, I'm Chicago like some harolds\nI will borrow from the Boroughs , show tomorrow to the world\nPlace the urban and the rural, make the wall into a Mural\nLead it where it need to be, they jocking like a Nitti beat\nNow they cannot get rid of me, bye, bye to the industry\nLionel Richie is it me? hello?\n\n[Interlude: Chance The Rapper (Busta Rhymes)]\n(Chance The Rapper sing it to 'em)\nIs it me you're looking for?\nGonna find you\nAnd make you want me\n\n[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]\nBust Rhymes it come with the force and lay it across\nHit you like I'm playing lacrosse\nAnd if it was July I'd drop it on the day of the fourth\nThe fire make you bust a shot\nPull a string and get lost\nStinging guitars (Hello)\nI'm here with the floss\nA chain with a frost\nWhile the yellow diamonds shine with a gloss, I'm cold (ah)\nShit heavy like we weighing a horse\nViolate, one shot will turn your brain into sauce\nJust pray I remorse\nNigga you know we whip from the start\nYou slept on the art\nBugging on how we put out your spark\nWe separate the heat from corny shit and kept it apart\nStep on a dart, spit will test the rest of your heart\nNo rest in the dark (hello)\nWe the best of the sharks, we love and we fart\nAnd leave a mark so put it in park\nWhenever we bark, we make you come and get with this nigga\nGet next to this nigga, we past professional\nYou can call me a specialist nigga\nWe fuck shit up while you call me the best at this nigga\nThe way we put it down you'll be calling a censorship nigga\nWe holding a higher rank and we holding it back\nAnd I'm grimey niggas home when they shank\nOr they clickity clank (hello)\nNow just clap from front to back and just react (what?)\nLike you know you posted till you die it is the feeling (what?)\nKeep on clapping get to acting up now keep on packing (what?)\nAll inside (is high) now feel the fire in the building\nYou can never test they way I do it\nAnd the way I be moving my mouth and be\nShaking and shining and breaking em out\nAnd making the noise I be making everytime\nI be hitting a song I keep you waiting\n(Real talk) real shit\nAnd we'll see where y'all coulda come from\nI'll hit you with another mega after the fact\nAnd they want me to go a little quicker\nGet a bit of this then (bududududu) what's faster than that?\n(Hello) And I ain't going no where\nIt's me, Busta Bust\nSmooth Chance The Rapper\nText move big up\n\n[Outro]\nJust know\nGod

sippin my Moe'\nSlippin in slow, them pretty bitches sayin hello\nAnyway go \u2018head and diss, play your Oil of Olay\nLittle honeydip within a little Cariola\nI don\u2019t mean to hold you up but I got somethin to say\nSwear to only give you hot shit everyday\nAfraid of us, you know this ain\u2019t no game to us\nYou strange to us, that\u2019s when we gettin dangerous, come on\n\n[Chorus]\nThis,

announce\nFeelin my groove, my jigga jigga makin you bounce\nOthers is fair, me and my niggas breakin the bread\nStraight gettin it, we got you niggas holdin your head\nAfraid of us, you know this

even though we had our backs up against the wall\n\n[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]\nSee, a nigga survived the worst, but my life is glorious\nBetter know that I leaped every hurdle and I'm so victorious\nTake a look, I'm a symbol of greatness\nNow call a nigga Morpheus\nAs force securin' the win, better believe I'm so notorious\nYou know that I've been 'bout my bread\nEven though we rappin' now\nAnd yes, we used to live on the strip\nEven though a nigga higher level trappin' now\nSuperceded every one of my little struggles and\nFailure has never ever been an option (trust)\nA nigga paper long like rush hour traffic\nAnd I'm about to take the hood shoppin'; get it!\n\n[Hook: Chester Bennington + (Busta Rhymes)]\nTogether we made it (you see we did it, niggas!)\nWe made it even though we had our backs up against the wall\n(C'mon!) Forever we waited (ha ha!)\nAnd they told us we were never gonna get it\nBut we took it on the road (to the riches)\nOn the road (to the ghetto)\nOn the road (from the projects to this bangin' instrumental)\nOn the road (ride with me!)\nOn the road (we come to get it)\nOn the road (yeah, yeah, yeah!)\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yo\n\n[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]\nWhen it all got started we were steadily just gettin' rejected\nIt seemed like nothin' we could do would ever get us respected\nAt best we were stressed\nAt the worst they probably said we're pathetic\nHad all the pieces to that puzzle, just the way to connect it\nI was fightin' through every rhyme, tightenin' up every line\nNever restin' the question if I was out of my mind\nIt finally came time to do it or let it die\nSo we put the chips on the table and told 'em to let it ride\nSing it, yeah!\n\n[Hook: Chester Bennington + (Busta Rhymes)]\nTogether we made it (you see we did it, niggas!)\nWe made it even though we had our backs up against the wall\n(C'mon!)

it Gonna Be?'\nI had to say it wowing, my heartbeat started pounding\nWalked on the set while she got dressed\nIn cock rings on her outfit\nJanet, why you doing this to me?\nAt the time I couldn\u2019t believe we both were starring in this movie\nYou're in my video, you know a nigga loved it\nI spent 2.4 million on the fucking budget\nAll my jewelry flooded, see how the kid was on?\nFirst rap nigga album you\u2019ve ever featured on\nAnd I was weak in the Lord, despite the things we said\nMy first words to Hype Williams is \u201cI can\u2019t believe this dream\u201d\nShot a solo scene, I tried to make mines better\nBut I love when we shot together, and we rubbed up on each other\nBut I\u2019m a little jealous, Tip, your tongue went in her mouth\nIn that Poetic Justice movie, from what I can account\nYou know what we be \u2018bout\u2026\nAny time, huh?\nAny place, baby?\n\nNow, you know, at the time, I was really\nI really had my crush on shorty, man, you know what I mean?\nYeah, I was in love with shorty since she was\nPenny and all that on Good Times and shit, you know what I mean?\nAyo, Kamaal, you\u2019s a fucked up dude for doing that to me, man\nYou broke my heart with that, man\n\n[Verse 2: Q-Tip]\nCome on, Buss, you know how many dudes say that to me?

(In the ghetto)\nDidn't know what my life would be (In the ghetto)\nI was dumb and oh so lazy (In the ghetto)\nSomething had a spell on me (In the ghetto)\nYou all know what I'm talking about (Talking about ghetto life)\n(Talking about ghetto life)\nYou all know what I'm singing about (Talking about ghetto life)\nGhetto life (Talking about ghetto life)\n\n[Busta Rhymes]\n(In the ghetto) Sure we be taking them chances\nWhile we search for the answers we be smoking them cancer sticks\nPolice provoking motherfuckers we dancing\nAnd we be dodging them bullets they be popping off at us, shit\nBut yet we always romance the street\nAnd fall in love with the hood until somebody come blast the heat\nAlways up to no good, so all of my fam could eat\nSee in the hood we hungry - hey nigga we playing for keeps\nMy soldiers on the block get on it\nIt be good if you flaunt it, we will take if we want it\nSee niggas from the ghetto got a different state of mind\nWith a different kind of hustle and we iller with the grind\nAnd develop our muscle until we sicker with the shine\nIn the struggle, thus our money come quicker doing crime\nI see the way we rep the hood, gotta love me\nYou can take me out the ghetto, but you can't take it from me\nGotta love it\n\n[Hook: Rick James] + (backup singers)\n(Talkin about ghetto life)\nGhetto life (Talking about ghetto life)\nYou all know what I'm singing about (Talkin about ghetto life)\nGhetto life (Talking about ghetto life)\n\n[Busta Rhymes]\n(In the ghetto) That's where we get into that street shit\nHustle hard, try to get money quick (In the ghetto)\nThat's where I got my name from\nI learned to get money and I got all my game from (In the ghetto)\nThat's where you eat with a bunch of the wolves\nAnd get to hustling as hard as you could (In the ghetto)\nUntil your cake stacking shit'll get good\nThrow a block party for the whole hood (In the ghetto)\nWith them burnout cellys\nTalk crazy, sell drugs in front of Pancho Deli\nCrackhead chicks still smuggle babies in they belly\nAnd then piss in elevators 'til the lobby all smelly (In the ghetto)\nThat's where I keep my ratchets\nGet my instincts and survival tactics\nAin't nothing like the hood nigga, I don't care\nYou surviving in the ghetto you can make it anywhere\nGotta love it\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Interlude: Busta Rhymes]\nTo my East coast niggas - rep your ghetto\nWest coast niggas - rep your ghetto\nMidwest niggas - rep your ghetto\nDown South niggas - rep your ghetto\nTo my East coast niggas - rep your ghetto\nWest coast niggas - rep your ghetto\nMidwest niggas - rep your ghetto\nTo my Dirty South niggas - rep your ghetto\n\n[Busta Rhymes]\n(In the ghetto) Even though they act rude\nYou'll always find a good chick to hold a brick for they dude\nBehind the bullshit, me and my clique on the move\nWe honor the code of the street, and live by the rules (In the ghetto)\nIs where, all of the hood's at\nFind the most crooks and they sell the most drugs at\nWhere you find beautiful women and rugrats\nAnd some of the most powerful people, I love that!\nCome mon\n\n[Outro: Rick James] + (backup singers)\n(Talking about ghetto life)\nYou all know what

"[Verse 1: Jamal]\nTaking you to the other terrain, we mash strictly for the cream\nHere to kill your whole scene and your motherfuckin team\nLittle 'Mal, the raw dawg, I know you heard of me\nYou probably know some bitch niggas who wanna murder me\nBusta Reggie Murray Ramp and Mercy's all we need for disaster\nFor me the microphone master\nLook, I crash ya, bash ya skull\nFuck with Mally G if you're trying to take a fall\nNiggas talk about killin and never get to it\nFuck the yappin, be true to it, do it\nSteady scream about your East and your West side\nBut you ain't in it when it comes to the homicide\nNiggas better get up off that bullshit quick\nCaught up in the limelight gettin way too slick\nSee em at the shows bout to rock they shit off\nGettin they peeps fucked up cause they block is soft\nAs for terror, I sever the best of MC's\nLook, little Mally G trippin off these indo trees\nAbout to murder label's jerkin but mercy us\nDef Squad niggas prophesize like the Perseus\nDroppin degrees to zero with flatlines\nKill your whole entourage off with just one rhyme\nOne rhyme... one rhyme... just one rhyme\nI don't give a fuck I kill em with just one rhyme\nWoo, hah, heh, yahah, you wish that you could get with this\nTerrorist, lyricist, for your era it's\nMy time to shine and I'm still payin dues\nAnd I'mma be famous on either rap or the news, motherfucker\nI only tell you nothin but the real it's\nTight up in the struggle tryin to get this fuckin meal, why?\nNiggas act shifty so I shift along\nThree tried, three gone, it's the same ol' song\nI seen the shades and the suedes from afar, Pa\nBut hold up do you know who I are?\nThe M-A-Double, you want trouble you got it the spot is on\nYou blot it I got it then shot it it's hot up in your dome\nPeace with the chrome piece that I pack\nRemember fuck around and catch a Mack to your back\n\n[Verse 2: Redman]\nWho the fuck I be I, you cannot see I\nFlabbergasted, blasting my Magnum P.I\nOops I lie, I got a cannon bout the size of Grand Canyon\nI'm prime time, giving MC's Knots Landing\nDuck, heavens to fuckin Mergatroid\nI drop noise that employs the unbelievable\nRecline like receding hairline, crime speaks fine\nWith a nine pull line blind keep mines up my sleeve until\nYou start to quiver, metabolism splits rivers\nI rock so many broads I leave your entourage tender\nLike bartenders mix liquor\nI serve you over the rocks, I feed you to my flock, now time to click triggers\nManslaughter in alphabetical order for four quarters\nRaw water turn sons to granddaughters\nAh ha ha ha ha! I bring trouble where, you sleep\nSo I double dare to bust you in your bubble bear, coat\nAntidotes cause gunsmoke in Tokyo\nMC's dosey doe your mics up in this rodeo\nMy star roast em up by the thousands, millions, quadrillions\nShuttin down national state buildings with high ceilings\nFunk Doc to the spot freeze\nCreepin on MC's like Vietnamese in army fatigues\nDef Squad representer\nHit yo' ass up from the bottom when you enter\n\n[Verse 3: Keith Murray]\nHey yo once a crack head, always a tack head\nYou have no craftibility all that shit you talk is dead\nAs sex drugs and violence, balance the scales of reality\nY'all don't want no parts of Keith Murray\nI'm nicety and sheisty, I get that ass iced deliciously\nNiggas ain't shit to me (word up)\nYou stupid niggas always got somethin smart to say\nAnd probably can't even spell TWA\nMy crew is like police pull up and park anywhere (ERRRRR)\nJump out and get it on right then and there (whassup whassup??)\nNiggas is pussy and ways and actions show it\nPlus y'all niggas dead, and don't even know it\nAnd Def Squad L.O.D. for life (word up, yeah fuck your life)\nAct trife I'll let my dog cold fuck your wife\n\n[Interlude: Announcer]\nAiyyo, you just heard the sounds of Mally G\nRedman, Keith Murray, bringin the ruckus, the Def Squad\nNext up is the Flipmode Squad, this is Howard Cossell\nFirst up to the ring Rampage the Last Boy Scout\nLord Have Mercy For, and the In-fer-mous\nBusta Rhymes\n\n[Verse 4: Rampage]\nTwo one two, I'm living life as a rugged MC\nWhen I step up in your jam yo I'm V.I.P\nNiggas and bitches be eyein me\nI'm spontaneous, I'm wreckin brothers out the frame\nBecause I'm dangerous\nI'm well known like Keith Murray and my boy Reggie Noble\nChickenheads get gassed, so they call me on my mobile *beeping*\nI'm great distance like AT&T\nI stroke like a butterfly, sting like a bee\nYo I Fades Them All like my man Mally G\nWhip a nigga ass for free\nAnd makin sure he see visions of me\nRampage the talk of the town\nThe stalker of New York that fucks up the underground (no doubt)\nI'm comin thorough like a pack of Life Savers\nAsk Marley Marl who's the real Future Flavors\nMy technique I freak seven days a week\nI'm undefeated, you can see my Quantum Leap\nI'm hittin brothers where it hurt, lyrical expert\nThose who got no publishing they need to get jerked (no doubt)\nA hundred percent, I gets down what I invent\nRap artists be dying to a certain extent\nSometimes they use the underground to make a comeback\nThat shit is wack, fade away and never come back\n\n[Verse 5: Lord Have Mercy]\nFor now and forever, it's the, evil that men do\nMental, my inner center Winter\nFrosted froze crews inventor, inventor\nInvader, evacuate I collapse your major\nStraights and loose minds\nYou're splits two times, for intruders, for these losers\nMy maneuvers, drop like lugers\nIllegal, maybe Lethal, like Gibson's\nSplittin blessings, with three Weapons\nLay in the cut like C-Sections, infestin the nine-six\nFor you mindless, niggas I smack spineless\nOr lay back like recliners, as inject jewels\nAs flesh, moves, when in vaginas, oooh, oooh ooh ooh\nCorrupt your minors, like New York City's finest\nLineups, on LSD fine dust, in your sinus\nCrush like chinas, opiuMC grinders\nMy dust, these rhymers I hijack like airliners\nThe infiltrator, creator, I'm sinful\nPapers stay viscous like religious cults\nLeaders that drop scriptures, and rock clips or assault heaters\nMy Flipmode niggas, we're like Afghanistan guerillas\n\n[Verse 6: Busta Rhymes]\nIf you want more information look listen and read\nWhile I sit back and I roll another fat bag of weed\nWe about to take control of your set like cruise control speed\nSatisfy my lyrical semen, plants my Johnny Apple-seed\nMental slave grip on your brain like white people\nMy music will dominate the population like black people\nUtilize my efforts to execersize my inner thoughts\nI capitalize on my many and various styles of all sorts\nHold down the forts smokin drinkin mad quarts\nFor sports talk to chickenheads in botty lik shorts\nLet's get the cream so that we can move up in this fortress\nBounce to art galleries and purchase exotic portraits\nHere we go again, another phenomenon when I get on\nBusta Rhymes and my nigga named Stretch Armstrong\nWe represent the ultimate unit for the nine-season\nFlipmode Squad will bust your shit for even the wrong reasons\nChaotic sample make a nigga wanna get down\nTill they come through like the ATF and shut your shit down\nAlcohol tobacco and firearms is how we movin\nRaw rapid fire flows while the music keeps you niggas groovin\nI don't know who the fuck you really think you foolin\nYou're so far from up to par and your shit needs improvin\nFrom your conversation the way you come across your shit is off\nMalfunctionin my nigga you about to feel the real force\nLay you on your face while I beat you up your head with the holy cross\nExotic niggas blastin off to the Land of the Lost\nIf you can't see this\nI recommend some school for the blind by Helen Keller\nBig ups to Lord Have Mercy, Rampage and the Cella Dwellas\nRedman and the Rockafellas\nBig ups to Mally G, Keith Murray sunny days and bad weathers\nBut still we travel the world like National Lampoon\nIt's Busta Rhymes for the whole entire ninety-six SO STAY TUNED!!!\nHahahahahahahahah\nFlipmode COMPLETELY getting inside that ass\nDef Squad, respek"}}, {"title": "Decision", "album": "Back on My B.S.", "year": "2009-05-19", "lyrics":

alright\nGoing to stay strong and keep it tight\nI'll be there indeed\n\n[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]\nYes, let me talk to you\nSee when it feels like the sun ain't shining bright enough\nIt's like the devil's trying to work to give an idol up\nAnd though I'm blessed, I still got to handle the things I go through\nIt's good to have a friend, with another perspective to show you\nSomeone you know that knows you and gives you motivation\nSomeone that you can go to and vent your frustrations\nWe always talk about our peeps, how we be everywhere\nWhen you need them the most are they really ever there?\nSee, every thing be all good when we be having fun\nThe difference is really needing a friend than having one\nIt's good when your peoples are there to help your problems\nAnd help you smile about it while finding a way to solve them\nLook at here, let me keep it at 100 and let me tell you\nHow you hold me down is something I genuinely value\nI got a clearer view\nAnd being that you're always here for me I'll be here for you\n\n[Hook: Mary J.

But I'm sayin'\nEven though we probably link up every now and then\nWith minimal convo, look it's real good to see you friend\nSomething I realize is that I don't even have to mention\nIs whether or not you got me, that's something that I never question\nSometimes I feel that the people that I love don't appreciate me\nAnd some hate to see the shit I've been going through lately\nSee you was here, when it started to haywire\nYou're still here, walking with me going through the fire\nAnd I really love you for it, I know you all relate too\nOn everything that I believe and I appreciate you\nAnd just for that, it don't matter you can put that on my name\nThe way you rep me, let me be there just for you the same\nSometimes the pressure and the pain, it be wearing me out\nBut I thank you for just being there and for hearing me out\nI got a clearer view\nI thank God that you've been there for me, I'm here for you\n\n[Hook: John Legend]\nI made a decision\nDespite all the things that we go through\nI'm gon' to take my time with you\nAnd be a friend indeed\nI made a decision\nEverything's gon' be alright\nGoing to stay strong and keep it tight\nI'll be there indeed\nI made a decision\n\n[Verse 3: Common]\nI look in your eye and I see the pain in it\nLife's a game, maybe the game did it\nI know I changed, they say the fame did it\nLife has changed, maybe the game did it\nTwo friends, now in two different places\nAnd the mister catching planes, and you catching cases\nFriendship, we never based it on position\nNo matter the game, we both shared the same vision\nDecisions to split us in the place that life seemed to hit us\nI would come to town and never get up, with you\nAround then, things weren't so simple\nI had my own issues that I was trying to get through\nOutside chatter, messing with our mental\nOn the chase of funds, trust, you can't forget to\nIt's the real friends, that you've got to tend to\nNo matter how far, just know that I'm with you\n\n[John Legend & Jamie Foxx]\nI made a decision\nDespite all the things that we go through\nI'm going to take my time with you\nAnd be a friend indeed\nI made a decision\nThat everything will be alright\nGoing to stay strong and keep it tight\nI'll be there indeed\nI made a decision...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/39d2d4f1bba15212af6b346af49c7ff2.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Busta Rhymes", "raw": {"annotation_count": 5, "api_path": "/songs/8958", "apple_music_id": "315966622", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/8958/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "This is the 13th track off Busta Rhymes' album Back On My B.S.

money pound nigga, King Tut\nYou could see it in my smile nigga, King Tut\nMy jewelry look wild nigga, King Tut\nWho else be riding through the town in a Brinks truck\n\n[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]\nYo, yo, see the way I take over Casinos like De Niro said\nReachin' money short, watch how it fold up like a Hero bread\nNigga thought he was a Super-friend, now that hero dead\nTry to cross this shit, we represent, but that's a zero dread\nAll of this money I be countin'\nAnd my cup runneth over like a fuckin' water fountain\nAny nigga trynna front, I'mma show them shit that's ugly\nThrowin' bread until they jealous of your money, lookin' funny\nHold up!\nAnd body shit, that's what a monster do\nSee me throwin' this money and bitches like a sponsor do\nPut the gloves on and beat up a nigga like I'm Kostya Tszyu\nAnd fuck the talkin', just bring me my money like a prostitute\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Reek Da Villain]\nOkay, I'm ridin' through your city, blowin' diddies of that icky\nGot your wifey in the passenger, I'm ridin', now she lick me\nI get money like Mark Cuban and know my bank is heavy\nAnd I grip the 31 like Jason Terry when I'm shootin\nATM in my jeans, bank sittin' on my left thigh\nBurn a mansion down and watch it coverin' my left eye\nGirl on deck, I just whipped another lick\nNow my trap look like black Friday, twelve AM in front of Best Buy\nHaha, sour got me all sedated\nNiggas lookin' at me angry, what's with all the smiley faces?\nMy deniro like Shapiro, I see Johnny Cochran wages\nI'm no lawyer, but they only bring them bottles by the cases\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: J-Doe]\nOkay now stupid ass stacks in my pocket\nTest me, best be faster than a rocket\nI ain't got no time if it ain't about a profit\nIf you send me my deposit, I will have your city rockin'\nI get the hottest beats, niggas wish that they could rhyme on it\nI got the hottest watch, ain't even set the time on it\nThe way I'm killin' niggas it look like a crime, don't it?\nI got the light, with a little bit of lime on it\nOkay, now stupid ass stacks in my pocket\nWhip clean, jet ski attached to the Charger\nBitches want attention and I tell 'em try harder\nGot 'em doin' shit I know that's gon' be disgracin' they father\nOkay leggo\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "HAM Remix", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "[Busta Rhymes]\nExcuse me\nTell me, who you really

Rhymes]\nAnd if you don't see it y'all niggas can't fuck with our\nFlipmode Movement - bounce in your truck to us\nY'all get stupid - don't try to fuck with us\nBecause you will get carried away, yeah you'll get carried away\n\n[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]\nNow I'm subtle, once I pick up my metal\nPut my foot on the pedal, ridin' through every ghetto\nAnalyze the shit I'm seein' when I sip Amaretto\nA lot of bitches on the strip, struttin' in they stilettos\nThen they wave and say hello, when my Lambo' is yellow\nEverything they got a jingle when they walk like ah-Jello\nSee the niggas on the corner and I never forget it\nAnd I never regret it because I see how you get it\nNow because of you niggas, I'm a hustler nigga\n'Gnac guzzler nigga, rip your jugular nigga\nIn the night I become the type to love when it's dark\nCause when I pull up and park, is when I'm makin my mark\nSee the fact's that I'm tryin' to strive and capitalize in\nStart to max-a-mimize and b-build a ent-ter-prise\nAnd wh-while I'm stockin' this bread, keep ah-stockin' the lead\nAnd leave a permanent dot, on the top of your head\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes]\nAnd if you don't see it y'all niggas can't

Will, Flip-mooode!\nI'm the Enigma, there is none harder, smarter\nMartyr, Godfather, my entrance, your departure\nPardon Dre this beat is a monster, catchy\nLike sleepin under open windows that's drafty\nThen wakin' up my throat scratchy, that's how I spit it nasty\nThey short, a few inches North of a dwarf\nMy flow's Murci\u00e9lago, ghostin' them narcos\nToastin' the ways of the original Pablos\nStill a pyramid architect, mix liquors like a chemist\nKiller lyricist, poetical tyrant\nSneaker store terrorist, Mt. Everest I climbed it\nHeat is drawn, no creepin on me whenever I'm bent\nMy mind spray, my nine spray\nAnd freak styles like 3000 Andre\nTo keep pilin, keep pushin them drops\nNas, runnin with hot Busta Bust, we don't stop\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes]\nAnd if you don't see it y'all niggas can't fuck with our\nFlipmode Movement - bounce in your truck to us\nY'all get stupid - don't try to fuck with us\nBecause you will get carried away, yeah you'll get carried away\n\n[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]\nNow I'm hot, and we runnin the block\nWatch me run in your spot, fiends comin in flocks\nAdd a little cut to the coke when I'm cookin the pot\nDRUGS, BITCH! I got what you want come and get what I got\nNow I almost forgot, I come to close up your shop\nI love to fold up a knot, love totin the Glock\nHelps me feel safer when niggas try to scheme on my plot\nTry to steal paper from me you gotta deal with a lot\nSee I will leave you to rot, only defendin my stock\nNiggas know they pussy and struggle to pretend that they not\nLose your life in the drop, while I harvest the crop\nMy hot shit; bust a cannon have you run in your socks\nSee we live on the edge, bang shit with a sledgehammer\nSplit up your head, kill a snitch for the feds\nLet's go, for the streets I'm always spittin a gospel\nGet Nas holdin a barrel size of elephant nostril\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes]\nAnd if you don't see it y'all niggas can't fuck with our\nFlipmode Movement - bounce in your truck to us\nY'all get stupid - don't try to fuck with us\nBecause you will get carried away, yeah you'll get carried away", "image":

don't see it y'all niggas can't fuck with our\nFlipmode Movement - bounce in your truck to us\nY'all get stupid - don't try to fuck with us\nBecause you will get carried away, yeah you'll get carried away\n\n[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]\nNow I'm subtle, once I pick up my metal\nPut my foot on the pedal, ridin' through every ghetto\nAnalyze the shit I'm seein' when I sip Amaretto\nA lot of bitches on the strip, struttin' in they stilettos\nThen they wave and say hello, when my Lambo' is yellow\nEverything they got a jingle when they walk like ah-Jello\nSee the niggas on the corner and I never forget it\nAnd I never regret it because I see how you get it\nNow because of you niggas, I'm a hustler nigga\n'Gnac guzzler nigga, rip your jugular nigga\nIn the night I become the type to love when it's dark\nCause when I pull up and park, is when I'm makin my mark\nSee the fact's that I'm tryin' to strive and capitalize in\nStart to max-a-mimize and b-build a ent-ter-prise\nAnd wh-while I'm stockin' this bread, keep ah-stockin' the lead\nAnd leave a permanent dot, on the top of your head\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes]\nAnd if you don't see it y'all niggas can't fuck with our\nFlipmode Movement - bounce in your truck to us\nY'all get stupid - don't try to fuck with us\nBecause you will get carried away, yeah you'll get carried away\n\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nIll Will, Flip-mooode!\nI'm the Enigma, there is none harder, smarter\nMartyr, Godfather, my entrance, your departure\nPardon Dre this beat is a monster, catchy\nLike sleepin under open windows that's drafty\nThen wakin' up my throat scratchy, that's how I spit it nasty\nThey short, a few inches North of a dwarf\nMy flow's Murci\u00e9lago, ghostin' them narcos\nToastin' the ways of the original Pablos\nStill a pyramid architect, mix liquors like a chemist\nKiller lyricist, poetical tyrant\nSneaker store terrorist, Mt. Everest I climbed it\nHeat is drawn, no creepin on me whenever I'm bent\nMy mind spray, my nine spray\nAnd freak styles like 3000 Andre\nTo keep pilin, keep pushin them drops\nNas, runnin with hot Busta Bust, we don't stop\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes]\nAnd if you don't see it y'all niggas can't fuck with our\nFlipmode Movement - bounce in your truck to us\nY'all get stupid - don't try to fuck with us\nBecause you will get carried away, yeah you'll get carried away\n\n[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]\nNow I'm hot, and we runnin the block\nWatch me run in your spot, fiends comin in flocks\nAdd a little cut to the coke when I'm cookin the pot\nDRUGS, BITCH! I got what you want come and get what I got\nNow I almost forgot, I come to close up your shop\nI love to fold up a knot, love totin the Glock\nHelps me feel safer when niggas try to scheme on my plot\nTry to steal paper from me you gotta deal with a lot\nSee I will leave you to rot, only defendin my stock\nNiggas know they pussy and struggle to pretend that they not\nLose your life in the drop, while I harvest the crop\nMy hot shit; bust a cannon have you run in your socks\nSee we live on the edge, bang shit with a sledgehammer\nSplit up your head, kill a snitch for the feds\nLet's go, for the streets I'm always spittin a gospel\nGet Nas holdin a barrel size of elephant nostril\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes]\nAnd if you don't see it y'all niggas can't fuck with our\nFlipmode Movement - bounce in your truck to us\nY'all get stupid - don't try to fuck with us\nBecause you will get carried away, yeah you'll get carried away"}}, {"title": "Shake It", "album": "Who You Mad At?

got the shit on a smash now listen\nI light the L smell a wiff of the hash\nAnd bag all the bitches, now watch you see me zip in a flash\nI'm saying hmm, now I'm a put you on blast\nJust like a tint window when you put your shit on the glass\nBust right through the window then it sit on the dash\nAnd have a nigga driving wreckless till you making him crash\n(Hah, c'mon) we making money and shit\nNow pop your muffin while we be watching you shaking your shit\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Bridge]\nWelcome to Hot-and-Hazyville\nIt make you wanna dance till you break your heels\nI know you love the way the God make your feel\nNow watch me get deeper than a Navy Seal (Navy Seal?)\nIt got a crazy feel, shit feel like you in a danger field\nHypnotize, stuck it in her, daze for real\nThat's exactly why we

Change your dungarees\nSmoking trees, getting cottonmouth, wild munchies\nBounce down the block, eat food at Luigi's\nAss constipated... too much extra cheese\nBut anyway, while I was cooling down at Luigi's\nI met some Siamese twins from overseas.. Lebanese\nLesbians with the friends from New Orleans\nThey had a fifth friend, she was straight Black-Portuguese\nPretty palm-olive-soaped skin, Aloe Vera leaves\nShe looked like the type of chick you only see in fantasies\nThe type of chick you would KILL for to get between the knees\nYo. I made time to chill with Miss Portuguese\nWould you believe the bitch tried to steal my fucking house keys\nAnd rob me for my G's\nHad to show this crazy broad I mastered my degrees and my Ph.D's\nGot your face on camera; motherfucker say cheese\nYou better get with your friends quick, before I start to squeeze\nGetting caught up in that freaky gold-digger Jamborees\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes & [Q-Tip]]\nI caught that ill vibe Tip [word Bust?] yo yo word\nThat ill vibe Tip [word Bust?] yo yo word\nCause when I'm in the place you know my shit be absurd\n[I caught that ill vibe Bust] Word Tip?

We can't have that\nI'll hold your hand, Black\nWe can't wind up with scratch\nI put my best foot forward as I play this life\n'Cause this world is bound to get ya like a double-edged knife\nIn the jam we regulate, 'cause we organize\nLogic-a-lly thinking when along's enterprise\nA lot of brothers from the ghetto got the gift of gab\nPeace to the West Coast and the East, we fab\nNeed I make mention that the crew we've got\nMake things get hot, like the FoFo shot. Blaow!\nNo, we don't promote no guns, but don't turn that cheek\nIn the world that we live, kindness is viewed as weak\nSo, we got to stay on point for all these lizards and snakes\nSome of them come as friends; some of them come as Jakes\nWe decipher all the frauds and build grounds with our friends\nWhy's that?\nSo we can live right until time ends\nYo, why's that?\nAmalgamate, so we can get

the bees\nMake Funkmaster Flex say 'Yo, I'm feeling these'\nFlows make you shit in your drawers. Change your dungarees\nSmoking trees, getting cottonmouth, wild munchies\nBounce down the block, eat food at Luigi's\nAss constipated... too much extra cheese\nBut anyway, while I was cooling down at Luigi's\nI met some Siamese twins from overseas.. Lebanese\nLesbians with the friends from New Orleans\nThey had a fifth friend, she was straight Black-Portuguese\nPretty palm-olive-soaped skin, Aloe Vera leaves\nShe looked like the type of chick you only see in fantasies\nThe type of chick you would KILL for to get between the knees\nYo. I made time to chill with Miss Portuguese\nWould you believe the bitch tried to steal my fucking house keys\nAnd rob me for my G's\nHad to show this crazy broad I mastered my degrees and my Ph.D's\nGot your face on camera; motherfucker say cheese\nYou better get with your friends quick, before I start to squeeze\nGetting caught up in that freaky gold-digger Jamborees\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes & [Q-Tip]]\nI caught that ill vibe Tip [word Bust?] yo yo word\nThat ill vibe Tip [word Bust?] yo yo word\nCause when I'm in the place you know my shit be absurd\n[I caught that ill vibe Bust] Word Tip? [yo yo word]\n[That ill vibe Bust] Word Tip? [yo yo word]\n[So when I hold the mic you know my shit be absurd]\n[I caught that ill vibe Bust] Word Tip? [yo yo word]\n\n[Verse 2: Q-Tip]\nI got weight on my shoulders in the form of this beat\nAin\u2019t nothin' sweet, on the street, for good deeds I compete\nCome on complete, and unique, so get back in your stance\nWe enhance and we're playing the whole world circumstance\nSo do good in your hood even though you puff lah\nPositive to comply\nDon\u2019t screw face and act rah\nProgress, don't fall back. We can't have that\nI'll hold your hand, Black\nWe can't wind up with scratch\nI put my best foot forward as I play this life\n'Cause this world is bound to get ya like a double-edged knife\nIn the jam we regulate, 'cause we organize\nLogic-a-lly thinking when along's enterprise\nA lot of brothers from the ghetto got the gift of gab\nPeace to the West Coast and the East, we fab\nNeed I make mention that the crew we've got\nMake things get hot, like the FoFo shot. Blaow!\nNo, we don't promote no guns, but don't turn that cheek\nIn the world that we live, kindness is viewed as weak\nSo, we got to stay on point for all these lizards and snakes\nSome of them come as friends; some of them come as Jakes\nWe decipher all the frauds and build grounds with our friends\nWhy's that?\nSo we can live right until time ends\nYo, why's that?\nAmalgamate, so we can get these ends\nYo, true that\nBusta and Tip, you know we make minds bend\n\n[Hook] - performed in reverse order"}}, {"title": "No Love (Remix)", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "First I, stop it,

my hand on a nigga\nUnless its definitely necessary otherwise it's unsuitable\nGoing through a lot of different little things\nThat make a nigga wanna go and wanna get in\nWhen I bring couple goons, that can handle couple situations\nAnd I let 'em eliminate all the bullshit so I can SING\nRun though every city, run though every state\nThough we get a lot of love I love to get a lot of hate\nThough the ones who will try to hate will start to love\nCause it's undeniable that everything I do is great\nEven when I do it wrong I'mma share it in a song\nAnd I question is it worth it in the end all along\nI guess I gotta die first return reincarnated\nJust to really witness it in another form\nBut until that time I'll embellish it and shine\nWhile I set in wit' the grind\nGive me credit when it's mine boy I dead it like a nine millimeter\nSee the sign and the heater that I'm givin all my people get in line now\nYeah, for the ones that hate or try to stop my growth in the light

popped off GET HIS BLOCK KNOCKED OFF\nWhen a nigga come and when a nigga front gotta give it to em good\nGive a nigga what he want, and if a nigga act up shoot em in the hand\nIn the face, in the stomach in the foot, or the heart (LOVE)\nYou don't want it homie you don't wanna start\nEspecially when a motherfucker see the gun fire spark\n*You don't want no problems*\nWhen I got the gun up in your mouth, I make a nigga gun talk\nBus Rhymes Reek\nI'mma hit em in the front homie hit em in the back\nKeep on hittin that nigga in the chest cavity\nTill that motherfucker lay down flat\n**Freeze motherfucker look**\nTrust me I'mma make a nigga sit still\nAnytime I gotta defend the food nigga\nIt don't matter what it is homie I will\nBeat a nigga till your brother can't figure it out\nOr i-dentify the mother fucker on the real\nWord on everything a nigga really love\nIt don't matter who it is homie I kill\nBut now I'm finally waking up outta the dream\nAnd I realize that life is so beautiful\nAnd I ain't gotta put my hand on a nigga\nUnless its definitely necessary otherwise it's unsuitable\nGoing through a lot of different little things\nThat make a nigga wanna go and wanna get in\nWhen I bring couple goons, that can handle couple situations\nAnd I let 'em eliminate all the bullshit so I can SING\nRun though every city, run though every state\nThough we get a lot of love I love to get a lot of hate\nThough the ones who will try to hate will start to love\nCause it's undeniable that everything I do is great\nEven when I do it wrong I'mma share it in a song\nAnd I question is it worth it in the end all along\nI guess I gotta die first return reincarnated\nJust to really witness it in another form\nBut until that time I'll embellish it and shine\nWhile I set in wit' the grind\nGive me credit when it's mine boy I dead it like a nine millimeter\nSee the sign and the heater that I'm givin all my people get in line now\nYeah, for the ones that hate or try to stop my growth in the light from above\nWhen I fight I hold a grudge it's a Kanye shrug\nSee the way I make 'em bug motherfucker don't no Love"}}, {"title": "Calm Down Single Art", "album": "E.L.E.

BIG fuck a bitch\nBIG duck a bitch quick fast\nDick to ass, don\u2019t hesitate to split fast\nYou know what\u2019s up, here\u2019s a quarter and a buck\nMy steps is kinda creaky, try not to wake my moms up\nCause when I bust, I lick shots like a shotty\nThats why nut is drippin all over your body!\nYou know what\u2019s up!\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes]\nB.R. and B.I. get cream, people always sayin\u2019 what the hell does that mean?\nBitches always see me and they can\u2019t understand how I once a little boy and became a man\nNow, as for the way we make em scream and shout, bitches\nOne by one I knock you out, bitches\nOne by one I knock you out, bitches\nOne by one I knock you out, bitches\n\n[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]\nYou\u2019re dippin your hand in the grab bag\nStopping and than I drop it, and pop em, dig up all in your ass bag\nShe giving me head all up in the back of the damn cab\nThe meter running hoping shawty paying the damn tab\nShe how the ass drag\nThis shit big, thats why we fuck em New York all the way down to Baghdad\nStabbing the pussy and jabbing like I\u2019m Zab Judah\nAnd plummet her pussy with plungers like I\u2019m Roto Rooter\nBeat the pussy til the shit flab\nAnd wear it out til it swole and the coochie smelling like king crab\nThis type of dick is something this bitch never had\nAnd make her swollow the dick til the bitch gag\nGet mad, chick grabbing all over my jonhson, Charles Bronson\nBig slab of meat, hungry and fresh of a monthly so she had to eat\nThrowing me the ass and we ain't even have to speak\n\n[Hook]", "image":

1: Busta Rhymes]\nWhen we do this shit now tell me why is you competing\nWhen I be that type of nigga that get money when I'm sleeping\nAnd when I'm farting and shitting I cop contries on the weekend\nSo ambitious my accoundents cop continents when I'm eating for me\nBussa Buss the most dominant, start retreating\nBeat the street up, shit be sounding remarkable\nWhen I'm speaking homie\nHuge rechargable batteries, bitch I'm tweaking, only\nShort circuit electric chair bolteses every feature Coly\n*HIIIH* Like I'm short for breath drowning in money rushes\nFuck a blunt bitch I'm inhaling muffles and smoke from buses\nI defend my money like soldiers I come to punish\nDefence mechanism from infections, the way that BUSS IS\nAin't no fucking around, I'm fronting, Get it?\nAs for getting this bread I'm like vomit so disgusting with it\nHere's my other alias, don't forget it, call me Snow-blower\nBlowing this bread like its nothing with it\n\n[Hook]\nYeah we see you bust a

girls lips, got my dick resting on 'em\nSoon as they woke up, it came and left it on 'em\nSwag with no effort on em, quicker than a leopard on 'em\nIf he got beef watch me sprinkle salt and pepper on 'em\nNo Spinderella just plenty metal for any fellow\nSemi settle everything for me and everything for me\nSmoking on that G13 and everything funny\nSpecially y'all bitchass niggas, kiss-ass niggas\nBlood gang 6 flags niggas, no rollercoaster\nReal shit we hold the bread the hoes hold the toasters\nYoung Casanova, I bend their asses over\nShe say my dick stronger than a sixpack of Cola\nMan Im so fly I got arachnophobia\nPressure bust pipes, but Weezy bust twice\nHahaha\n\n[Hook]\nYeah we see you bust a bottle at your little table stunting\nAnd we coming by the bar get the

Remix. Remix.)\nGround Music. Flip mode. Aftermath. Here we go. (Remix Remix. Remix.)\n\n[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]\nReal talk word to mother it be the gutter brother\nBack with another banger to set off the summer\nBetter get up and come a-round\nCause the way our shit will be cloggin up the toilet\nYou probably should call the plumber\nYou niggas get dumb and dumber\nThinkin you can come around and test me\nLike these other niggas, well, pick a number\nI''m sayin you should never ever think that you better nigga\nGet it together and body your shit\nSince mommy named me Trevor\nStellar the way I give a hell of a performance and get a\nReaction I attract all the people to come together\nWhether niggas realize it or not oppose a letter\nJust let a fella think what it wouldn't make him rememeber that\nWhen I'm in the buildin it's cool for you to rest in\nRemember I'm too hot to touch kid\nCurious, my fire burnin niggas serious\nI gift wrapped the flame and give it to niggas, here it is\nSee through motherfuckers, we'll never be equal\nI'll banish and make 'em vanish and do it for (the people)\nI be the baddest see when I spit I become the maddest\nAnd kill 'em until the blood'll (seep through)\nFront if you want but you know who the top biller\nBounce while I'm killing the strut and walk with a bop, killer!\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes]\nSo don't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)\nDon't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)\nHere we go\n\n[Verse 2: Reek Da Villian]\nR-double E-K, D-A Villian\nI'll pull a grip out of this waist and splatter ya face\nWhen the cali' blow, you'll get a face shot like a cameo\nRob the man and leave his ass naked like he D'Angelo\nBet I'll let a pistol dismiss you if it's a issue\nOf a tissue that money'll get you clapped quick (come on)\nTurn a wimp past wittle to a gym class hero\nWhen my AR13'll make 'em backflip (come on)\n\n[Verse 3: Spliff Star]\nI'm a BK felon I'll run you down with a weapon\nMy goonies get looney anytime that I tell 'em\nDead 'em, I walk around with stacks in my denim\nWith fast foreign cars with the gator skin in 'em\nNow I got pretty women all around the world\nIf I been in your city probably pound your girl\nHad her stretched out swimmin in the pool with her breast out\nSend her back home set to fire the sex out\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes]\nSo don't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)\nDon't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch (So

are\nUsed to be fishscales, now we fuck with caviar\nEatin on supreme shit, at the round table\nOn some cream shit, like I grew up in Queensbridge\nI talk reckless, the whole world know\nMy style is C4 and I'm ABOUT TO BLOW\nSo don't get close, we'll touch ya ribs\nAnd come bust lil' brother with the stick-up kids\nLike, \"Shh, take off the watch\"\n\"Shh, take off the watch\"\n\"Shh, take off the watch\"\nThey said Game in the club with a big ass Glock\nLike boom, guess who stepped in the room\nLAX comin' through JFK real soon\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes]\nSo don't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)\nDon't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)\nHere we go\n\n[Verse 5: Lil Wayne]\nJump on the track like Michael Jeffrey\nEven the referee say I need an ESPY\nAward just applaud I'm a boar with a broad\nI go hard and my leather so soft and I cough\nAnd the board of health say the boy need help\nI am so hot the AM just melt\nAll aboard, all aboard black card, no fraud\nI'm an extension cord, I'm a lightning rod\nI'm a lion roar, I'm a dinosaur\nI'm a sinus minus the nose, I'm a cold\nI'm raw than a temperature rose to five and\nTwo o's that's 500 degrees for those who know\nMy fire's higher than a liars\nWe don't burn rubber, we burn tires\nWe riders, residers, we live in The Carter\nWayne is a flame that could live in the water\nOk now let's get it straight, either you bait or the mate\nEither way you on my plate gettin ate after grace\nIf you taste like base, snares and tenors be my dinner\nI'm hotter in the winter, burn like sinners, turn like spinners\nI swear I'll put ya in the urn by your picture\nBoy we ain't playin Weezy baby, he the man\nHotter than the Peter pan to a wet bare hand\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes]\nSo don't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)\nDon't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)\nHere we go\n\n[Verse 6: Nas]\nMan, listen I spot a square dude from a distance\nThrough the tinted Maybach curtain in partition\nNip/Tuck niggas, I could never fuck with 'em\nOr pass the blunt with 'em, let the guns hit 'em\nBring fire, frizzy hair for press-spire\nYou ain't a rider, pa'tna I'm a crippler\nCrutch giver, hospitalizer, hottest whip driver\nKeep on my hip, the biggest life or death decider\nI ain't a rapper or an activist, I'm badder\nI used to run from a cracker named Lieutenant Casper\nNo black leather jackets or black berets\nSince my old days, like I stepped from a Vogue page\nAnd none of y'all cop what I cop\nForget your excuse if the music ain't hot\nWhere the Range? Where the drops? Y'all never got hoes\nSee you on the club, wrist never on froze\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes]\nSo don't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)\nDon't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)\nHere we go\n\n[Verse 7: Big Daddy Kane]\nBusta Bus pick me up in the Coupe to come bubble through\nThis is routine kid it ain't nothin new\nYou bring trouble to me, the untouchable\nMake me have to bring in the troops like George W\nI'll scorch you somethin awful when I fall through\nOf course the raw to be when you could put a broad to\nBetter bring with you your fire extinguisher\nListen, I love static and I'm ready to cling to ya (OK!)\nKid I made it from magazine pages to big stages\nHigh wages through all of the different ages\nThinkin you do it like this is outrageous\nYeah I'm sick with it but it's not contageous\nYour hottest thing to me, not a thing\nEvery night my crib is like the Bada Bing\nSo make sure that you youngin's got it right\nKane's who's the fuckin rockstars party like, you heard?\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes]\nSo don't touch me nigga (You might burn

Remix. Remix.)\nGround Music. Flip mode. Aftermath. Here we go. (Remix Remix. Remix.)\n\n[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]\nReal talk word to mother it be the gutter brother\nBack with another banger to set off the summer\nBetter get up and come a-round\nCause the way our shit will be cloggin up the toilet\nYou probably should call the plumber\nYou niggas get dumb and dumber\nThinkin you can come around and test me\nLike these other niggas, well, pick a number\nI''m sayin you should never ever think that you better nigga\nGet it together and body your shit\nSince mommy named me Trevor\nStellar the way I give a hell of a performance and get a\nReaction I attract all the people to come together\nWhether niggas realize it or not oppose a letter\nJust let a fella think what it wouldn't make him rememeber that\nWhen I'm in the buildin it's cool for you to rest in\nRemember I'm too hot to touch kid\nCurious, my fire burnin niggas serious\nI gift wrapped the flame and give it to niggas, here it is\nSee through motherfuckers, we'll never be equal\nI'll banish and make 'em vanish and do it for (the people)\nI be the baddest see when I spit I become the maddest\nAnd kill 'em until the blood'll (seep through)\nFront if you want but you know who the top biller\nBounce while I'm killing the strut and walk with a bop, killer!\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes]\nSo don't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)\nDon't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)\nHere we go\n\n[Verse 2: Reek Da Villian]\nR-double E-K, D-A Villian\nI'll pull a grip out of this waist and splatter ya face\nWhen the cali' blow, you'll get a face shot like a cameo\nRob the man and leave his ass naked like he D'Angelo\nBet I'll let a pistol dismiss you if it's a issue\nOf a tissue that money'll get you clapped quick (come on)\nTurn a wimp past wittle to a gym class hero\nWhen my AR13'll make 'em backflip (come on)\n\n[Verse 3: Spliff Star]\nI'm a BK felon I'll run you down with a weapon\nMy goonies get looney anytime that I tell 'em\nDead 'em, I walk around with stacks in my denim\nWith fast foreign cars with the gator skin in 'em\nNow I got pretty women all around the world\nIf I been in your city probably pound your girl\nHad her stretched out swimmin in the pool with her breast out\nSend her back home set to fire the sex out\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes]\nSo don't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)\nDon't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)\nHere we go\n\n[Verse 4: The Game]\nMotherfucker, it's FLIPMODE, when I come up in the club\nThrowin up a dub, liftin up a snub\nFlipmode be stars, you know who the fuck we are\nUsed to be fishscales, now we fuck with caviar\nEatin on supreme shit, at the round table\nOn some cream shit, like I grew up in Queensbridge\nI talk reckless, the whole world know\nMy style is C4 and I'm ABOUT TO BLOW\nSo don't get close, we'll touch ya ribs\nAnd come bust lil' brother with the stick-up kids\nLike, \"Shh, take off the watch\"\n\"Shh, take off the watch\"\n\"Shh, take off the watch\"\nThey said Game in the club with a big ass Glock\nLike boom, guess who stepped in the room\nLAX comin' through JFK real soon\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes]\nSo don't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)\nDon't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)\nHere we go\n\n[Verse 5: Lil Wayne]\nJump on the track like Michael Jeffrey\nEven the referee say I need an ESPY\nAward just applaud I'm a boar with a broad\nI go hard and my leather so soft and I cough\nAnd the board of health say the boy need help\nI am so hot the AM just melt\nAll aboard, all aboard black card, no fraud\nI'm an extension cord, I'm a lightning rod\nI'm a lion roar, I'm a dinosaur\nI'm a sinus minus the nose, I'm a cold\nI'm raw than a temperature rose to five and\nTwo o's that's 500 degrees for those who know\nMy fire's higher than a liars\nWe don't burn rubber, we burn tires\nWe riders, residers, we live in The Carter\nWayne is a flame that could live in the water\nOk now let's get it straight, either you bait or the mate\nEither way you on my plate gettin ate after grace\nIf you taste like base, snares and tenors be my dinner\nI'm hotter in the winter, burn like sinners, turn like spinners\nI swear I'll put ya in the urn by your picture\nBoy we ain't playin Weezy baby, he the man\nHotter than the Peter pan to a wet bare hand\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes]\nSo don't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)\nDon't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)\nHere we go\n\n[Verse 6: Nas]\nMan, listen I spot a square dude from a distance\nThrough the tinted Maybach curtain in partition\nNip/Tuck niggas, I could never fuck with 'em\nOr pass the blunt with 'em, let the guns hit 'em\nBring fire, frizzy hair for press-spire\nYou ain't a rider, pa'tna I'm a crippler\nCrutch giver, hospitalizer, hottest whip driver\nKeep on my hip, the biggest life or death decider\nI ain't a rapper or an activist, I'm badder\nI used to run from a cracker named Lieutenant Casper\nNo black leather jackets or black berets\nSince my old days, like I stepped from a Vogue page\nAnd none of y'all cop what I cop\nForget your excuse if the music ain't hot\nWhere the Range? Where the drops?

like a bunch of wide receivers\nTime is on the meter, go clean your act up in the cleaners\nChickenhead, give me some of your chicken fajitas\nYo I beg your pardon, I write my rhymes way past the margins\nSqueeze the Charmin, peace to one million men marchin\nWhen you talk shit you really don't know what you startin\nNow your shit is done like a fuckin empty milk carton\nIt's on for the '96, mad shows at the Ritz\nNow we got you open like Vicks\nStickin to your stomach like Quaker Oat Grits\nFisherman hat with my brand new kicks\nOn the low, I still rock my Girbauds\nSee the show, I got my nickel plated .44\nAll my rough niggas open the do'\n'Cause Boy Scout brings the ruckus and I'm still hardco'\nYo, when I walk streets you know my blade's a little sharper\nFuck Peter Parker, I cross you like a magic marker\nEverytime I hit I always hit a little harder\nBlazing to the point where niggas look a little darker\nCatching suntans from my music, fans understand\nMaking fat shit, I always love to lend a helping hand\nOrganized rhyme unit like the Poison Clan\nWhile your ride is busted, I be your luxury Sedan\nNumber one nigga in the chain of command\nBreakin' fool in school like my nigga Geechie Dan\nAiyyyyyo, I see intruders on my scan\nSingin at your funeral like Bobby \"Blue\" Bland\n\n[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]\nOne two three we gon' turn it out\nAnd make you rock to the beat and then scream and shout\nWe gonna hit you with the shit we got here\nWe gonna blow your mind (blow your mind)\nKeep it movin like this, keep it movin like that\nIf I die, I'mma only come back\nYo,

it come to paper, better know I'm major with it\nMake it rain a major blizzard, leather alligator lizard\nI Talledega race any challenger; name a digit!\nEven if on the slightest, you take a smidget\nOr dare touch my revenue, I'll slice you with the razor, quit it!\nIcy till I make it frigid, burr\nThe laws of physics says it's getting cold\nMy money taller than a hall of midgets\nI get up all up in it, kicking down the door, who is it?\nBitch, I be the crew of bill collectors, pay them all a visit\nAfter cleaning bank accounts you questioned\nIf I gave a shit, if not I tell the truth\nSo you could tell 'em that the player did it\nIt's OK, I say a prayer, it's the mayor bitch slayer\nGiving you another layer of the data trick\n\n[Bridge]\nBust Rhymes, hitting you with punch

you short my cake, I'm off side of your head\nBitch, where my fucking money?\n\n[Verse 2]\nCritical, it's pitiful, I'm cynical\nHow I deliver lyricals and take these other niggas paper\nTopsy-tervy controversy, I'm so thirsty, got no mercy\nFor some of these bitches, I collect my money now and later\nKeep it moving with the clique\nWhile making bitches hit the strip\nCake up everyday I wake, I rate the way my money flip\nI want it's mine, borderline, call it crime\nAll the shine I'm taking it, ain't no mistaking it\nNigga, what's yours is mine\nNo need to second guess it, check it, I'm the gloss and grind\nThe gritty and the floss, the profit and the loss, all intertwined\nBecause I profit from your losses\nYou don't want it, you should get it\nIn the hood with your money, I extended my line of credit\nThe medic, doctor rhymes that put you on a diuretic\nShrinking up a nigga pockets, simple niggas style pathetic\n\n[Bridge]\nBust Rhymes, hitting you with punch lines\nFunny how I fuck

Incredible Hulk shit\nI don't even know why you give me shit like this to spit to\nI'm sure we speak the same language\nFuck you bitches, pay me\n\n[Verse 1]\nWait a minute, came to go get it, ranger fitted\nWhenever it come to paper, better know I'm major with it\nMake it rain a major blizzard, leather alligator lizard\nI Talledega race any challenger; name a digit!\nEven if on the slightest, you take a smidget\nOr dare touch my revenue, I'll slice you with the razor, quit it!\nIcy till I make it frigid, burr\nThe laws of physics says it's getting cold\nMy money taller than a hall of midgets\nI get up all up in it, kicking down the door, who is it?\nBitch, I be the crew of bill collectors, pay them all a visit\nAfter cleaning bank accounts you questioned\nIf I gave a shit, if not I tell the truth\nSo you could tell 'em that the player did it\nIt's OK, I say a prayer, it's the mayor bitch slayer\nGiving you another layer of the data trick\n\n[Bridge]\nBust Rhymes, hitting you with punch lines\nFunny how I fuck dimes\nBitch, you know I want mine\nWhere my fucking money?\n\n[Hook]\nI ain't speaking foreign, you know what I'm sayin'\nBetter have my bread, nigga, I ain't playin'\nBitch, where my fucking money?\nMark every word spoken\nReddish so you're pussy if you think I'm jokin'\nMotherfucker, where my fucking money?\nThink I still ain't crazy \u2018cause I cut my dreads\nAnd if you short my cake, I'm off side of your head\nBitch, where my fucking money?\n\n[Verse 2]\nCritical, it's pitiful, I'm cynical\nHow I deliver lyricals and take these other niggas paper\nTopsy-tervy controversy, I'm so thirsty, got no mercy\nFor some of these bitches, I collect my money now and later\nKeep it moving with the clique\nWhile making bitches hit the strip\nCake up everyday I wake, I rate the way my money flip\nI want it's mine, borderline, call it crime\nAll the shine I'm taking it, ain't no mistaking it\nNigga, what's yours is mine\nNo need to second guess it, check it, I'm the gloss and grind\nThe gritty and the floss, the profit and the loss, all intertwined\nBecause I profit from your losses\nYou don't want it, you should get it\nIn the hood with your money, I extended my line of credit\nThe medic, doctor rhymes that put you on a diuretic\nShrinking up a nigga pockets, simple niggas style pathetic\n\n[Bridge]\nBust Rhymes, hitting you with punch lines\nFunny how I fuck dimes\nBitch, you know I want mine\nWhere my fucking money?\n\n[Hook]\nI ain't speaking foreign, you know what I'm sayin'\nBetter have my bread, nigga, I ain't playin'\nBitch, where my fucking money?\nMark every word spoken\nReddish so you're pussy if you think I'm jokin'\nMotherfucker, where my fucking money?\nThink I still ain't crazy \u2018cause I cut my dreads\nAnd if

gotsa be the sure shot\nMy live niggas y'know; who be the sure shot?\nLive bitches y'know; who be the sure shot?\nShhhiiieeettt...\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm back in ya soul just like a minister\nI'm big like a movie, I'm on the screen and at the cinema\nWhile I'm in the process of slowly gettin rid of ya\nI'm bag a couple bitches, and then I throw 'em in my videa\nYeah, yeah, the God of the block\nY'know me killa had you spreadin' the spot wet and twist it like Olivia\nOh shit, flow so sicker than Chlamydia\nWe know you a slouch duke, we don't even consider ya\nBoss nigga, see or hear me in ya area\nThe more niggas, the murders, the more the money, the more the merrier\nSmash shit 'til everything become mass hysteria\nHungry for street shit, see I be takin care of ya check nigga\nFuck all the talk, homey I'm daring ya\nThe lead from the shot'll poison ya blood like malaria\nMaybach Excelero exotic\nWorm skin interior, my swagger to my bitch to my money\nIt's all superior\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes]\nWhen we in the spot y'know that we sure to shine (to shine)\nIt's all so holy and so divine\nAnalyze niggas 'til we can read ya mind\nSometimes a real live nigga is hard to find\nWe like, \"drugs overdose niggas every time\"\n(Cocaina baby, cocaina baby, cocaina baby, cocaina baby)\n(Cocaina baby, cocaina baby, cocaina baby, cocaina baby)\nWe like, \"drugs overdose niggas every time\"\n(Cocaina baby, cocaina baby)\n\n[Verse 2]\nYo, I'm tired of tellin ya\nBack on my bullshit, fuckin put a shell in ya\nGangster niggas respect it, salute me on the regular\nWhen it comes to the street shit, define me as the emperor\nCheck it my nigga.. most of you muhfuckers amateur\nI muster the nigga quick and damage any challenger\nBut now y'know, \"Oh a nigga flow so spectacular\"\nBreak niggas down and handle you muhfuckin characters\nCaptain of this shit but most of you niggas is passengers\nI'm takin it back to the hood, like '87 Maximas\nYeah, yeah y'know who the truth, no need for askin the, same question again\nTo get the same answer bruh, fasten ya seatbelt\nBitches fuck wit the bachelor\nWit' money like a thousand coke deals from here to Panama\nStrike like a brightness, a light.. I'm here to dazzle ya\nWhole hood from the boroughs, to the niggas up in Attica\nSoldiers in the streets, the Middle East, way down to Canada\nWhen it comes to the block, y'know I'm the ambassador\nFollow nobody's footsteps, but said it like a scavenger\nWanna talk money bitch!? Then holla at my manager\nThe way y'all niggas is trash, my crew'll get to blasting ya\nTwelve shot clip, hollow tips, quick to plaster ya\nAll over the cement, spread ya like I'm mashing\nEverything, Bus-a-Bus date... but check ya fuckin calendar!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro: Marsha & Busta Rhymes]\nSo.. high..\nTake me all the waaayyy, where you are (cocaina baby, cocaina baby, cocaina baby)\nI really want to beeee, take me now\nTake us far awaayyy, to the skkkyyy (cocaina baby, cocaina baby, cocaina baby)\nI really want to beeee, so.. high"}}, {"title": "Been Through the Storm", "album": "The Big Bang", "year": "2006-06-09", "lyrics": "[Hook: Stevie Wonder]\nBeen through the storm, through the cold and rain\nEverything's still the same\nCan't control how I feel\nSometimes it's hard to keep it real\nYou see the luxuries in life, with the fortune and fame\nLike them Cadillacs with sunroofs mayne\nSo many ways to make a dollar\nHuh, sometimes I think about my father\nYou see my poppa was broke, and my momma was young\nTryin to blend in with them city folk\nEvery day landlord knockin down my do'\nWonderin where my next blessing is comin from\n\n[Busta Rhymes]\nMy momma and poppa, moved to the U.S. as Jamaicans\nStruggled to get visas and green cards through immigration\nThough my pop was po', stayed away from crime and malice\nHard living gave him hard hands and callous\nAs a young'n, peep how much they loved each other's space\nHis hard hands rubbin against the pretty skin of my mother's face\nDig for treasure 'til his hands looked like hands of a junkie\nSo coarse, slap a mule and take the life from a donkey\nOn the other hand, mommy was the type to work two jobs\nNever enough money, that's why I got your whole crew robbed\nGot older, developed ways of grippin the steel\nBarely home for me to see her, or get a good cooked meal\nSeek refuge in the alleged land of the free, lookin\nBlendin in with city folk, down in Flatbush Brooklyn\nFeel a little of my pain, follow and sing to it\nHomey I seen it all, if you ain't knowin I been through it\nIn other words I\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Busta Rhymes]\nGot a little older, late teens, me and my crew would huddle\nOn the corner late nights, plottin to escape struggle\nNights got cold and still would hustle in the same place\nIn front of Pancho Delis, now the freeze up on a nigga face\n1987 Reaganomics ever curious\nTo visit other cities, out of town kick was serious\nGuayanese jeans bounce, put whatever slinger on\nWhatever slinger came back, quickly brought me right along\nNigga ran away from home\nDoin different wild shit, just to put a pair of Filas on, 'Didas on\nWreck is all for the good, gettin into shit\nLike we innocent, actin older than we should\nWalk around broke in the hood, watchin all the rich niggas\nThese younger thugs who try to choke and try to get niggas\nThinkin 'bout my mom and pop, while I'm monopolizin\nTo hell with just gettin by and economizin\nIt's kinda hard bein humble in the belly of struggle\nDoin things that probably get you in trouble\nThat's why we stay up on the block, gettin money while we keepin it safe\nIn front of churchgoers keepin the faith\nMom and pop be worryin for they son\nDespite they struggle and their honest livin look and see just what I become\nA scavenger, in brute pursuit to be happy, another young'n that's wildin\nAcross the line until somebody tryin to cap me - ohhhh shit {*gunfire*}\n\n[Outro: Stevie Wonder - singer slower with more ad libs]\nI been through the storm\nThrough the cold and rain\nEverything's still the same\nCan't control how I feel\nSometimes it's hard to keep it real\nWoooooooooooooo-whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh\nYeahhhhhhhhhhh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh", "image":

hard to keep it real\nYou see the luxuries in life, with the fortune and fame\nLike them Cadillacs with sunroofs mayne\nSo many ways to make a dollar\nHuh, sometimes I think about my father\nYou see my poppa was broke, and my momma was young\nTryin to blend in with them city folk\nEvery day landlord knockin down my do'\nWonderin where my next blessing is comin from\n\n[Busta Rhymes]\nMy momma and poppa, moved to the U.S. as Jamaicans\nStruggled to get visas and green cards through immigration\nThough my pop was po', stayed away from crime and malice\nHard living gave him hard hands and callous\nAs a young'n, peep how much they loved each other's space\nHis hard hands rubbin against the pretty skin of my mother's face\nDig for treasure 'til his hands looked like hands of a junkie\nSo coarse, slap a mule and take the life from a donkey\nOn the other hand, mommy was the type to work two jobs\nNever enough money, that's why I got your whole crew robbed\nGot older, developed ways of grippin the steel\nBarely home for me to see her, or get a good cooked meal\nSeek refuge in the alleged land of the free, lookin\nBlendin in with city folk, down in Flatbush Brooklyn\nFeel a little of my pain, follow and sing to it\nHomey I seen it all, if you ain't knowin I been through it\nIn other words I\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Busta Rhymes]\nGot a little older, late teens, me and my crew would huddle\nOn the corner late nights, plottin to escape struggle\nNights got cold and still would hustle in the same place\nIn front of Pancho Delis, now the freeze up on a nigga face\n1987 Reaganomics ever curious\nTo visit other cities, out of town kick was serious\nGuayanese jeans bounce, put whatever slinger on\nWhatever slinger came back, quickly brought me right along\nNigga ran away from home\nDoin different wild shit, just to put a pair of Filas on, 'Didas on\nWreck is all for the good, gettin into shit\nLike we innocent, actin older than we should\nWalk around broke in the hood, watchin all the rich niggas\nThese younger thugs who try to choke and try to get niggas\nThinkin 'bout my mom and pop, while I'm monopolizin\nTo hell with just gettin by and economizin\nIt's kinda hard bein humble in the belly of struggle\nDoin things that probably get you in trouble\nThat's why we stay up on the block, gettin money while we keepin it safe\nIn front of churchgoers keepin the faith\nMom and pop be worryin for they son\nDespite they struggle and their honest livin look and see just what I become\nA scavenger, in brute pursuit to be happy, another young'n that's wildin\nAcross the line until somebody tryin to cap me - ohhhh shit {*gunfire*}\n\n[Outro: Stevie Wonder - singer slower with more ad libs]\nI been through the storm\nThrough the cold and rain\nEverything's still the same\nCan't control how I feel\nSometimes it's hard to keep it real\nWoooooooooooooo-whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh\nYeahhhhhhhhhhh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"}},

OOPS! Upside your head\nPut your head to bed -- let me do my thing -- nuff said\nShit so hot make your chickenhead do the spread\nTell me what you said -- I said I never leave you misled\nWhile you bullshit, I'd rather get the lucci instead\nHah-huh-hah-hee-hah! Flip until you fall\nWhylin in your whip, til you crash into a brick wall\nThrough the nine-six, I be that nigga that be priceless\nAlways blowin up your spot, bringin more surprises\nYou, you know you really need to come clean\nLet me do my thing, don't you even try to intervene\nI will endanger your species like an ostrich\nHold you hostage, and crazy feed you swine sausage\nHAH! I be the number one chosen just to keep you open\nChill with your thoughts I got your brain frozen\nPay the prices made the needed sacrifices\nTo present the grand opening of Flipmode Enterprises\n\n[Chorus]\nWatch me get down and just do my thing baby\n\n[Outro]\nLet me do my thing for nine-five, nine-six, suck dick\nYes I got the bag full of brand new tricks\nDead in the face,

security alert\nGrind Music\nFlip Mode\nAftermath\nHere we go!\n\n[Verse 1]\nBack with the most venomous rap\nIt be the Godfather of the club banger let me hear you clap\nYou can applause and from the very beginnin'\nYou can give me a standin' ovation\nWhile I bang your face in\nWith another banger, I call it a cliffhanger\nWatch me mangle and strangle this whole rap shit (Come on!)\nYou can see the way I make 'em mad sick\nFrom down bottom, the way I got 'em; give me my cash quick (Come on!)\nLock on; you better grab onto somethin'\nBecause I'm 'bout to shake shit again and make a black bitch (Cum on!)\nNow you hear the shots ring off\nFrom bitches takin' everything off\u2014each other\nGot 'em wildin', runnin' for cover\nThe King Kong-Big Foot-gully-with-a-skully bully of rap\nStill-ugly-with-the-money runnin' the trap\nNow they givin' me dap, as far as I'm concerned in this mu'fucker\nLook how I got 'em, now they ready to snap\n\n[Hook]\nSo don't touch me nigga! (You might burn yourself)\nDon't touch me nigga! (You might burn yourself)\nIt's gettin' hot in this bitch (So throw da water on 'em)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw da water on 'em)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw da water on 'em)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch! (So throw da water on 'em!)\nHere we go!\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow you see the alcohol spillin'\nAnd we got 'em hands in the ceilin'\nYou know we only come to rattle the bulidin'\nAnd break it on down just a little, once again\nKnowin' we holdin' the bank so let me keep the dice rollin'\nAnd keep it traditional the way I keep my money fallin'\nWhile you're slackin' on your MAC-in', Duke, we always keep it goin'\nRight to the left, do it to death, now watch me\nCome through with a chisel that make the game sizzle, and I\u2014\nPull out the skillet, prepare for the cookin'\nHow I'm wildin'; niggas wonder when I'm gonna bring the hook in\nThug's ice grill in every time they get to lookin'\nGot 'em wildin' overseas all the way back to \"Go Brooklyn!\"\nNow they ready to spazz 'cause we bring the best to them\nShit that shut it down on the regular, that's with the\u2014\nFly '80s nigga that was whippin' in a Cressida\nFresher than\u2014most of these niggas, killin' the rest of the\u2014\nFellas that was thinkin' they was rushin' in and bustin' in\nBut the way we was doin', we was musclin' they hustlin'\n\n[Hook]\nSo don't touch me nigga!

B.I.G]\nUhh (check it out), uhh\nDiamonds on my neck, chrome drop-top\nChillin' on the scene, smokin' pounds of green\nOooh-wee, you see, the ugliest\nMoney-hungriest, Brooklyn Loch Ness\nNine millimeter cock test, wan fi' test?\nAnd the winner is...\nNot that thinner kid, bandanas, tattoos\nMy fist never bruise, land-still-cruise\nFrank White paid his dues\nAsk who's the raw, bet they say Poppa very\nLook forward to me like commissary\nAll of a sudden, now every-body Big Willie\nDone did it, come widdit, get yo' head splitted\nOr get your neck slitted, admit it, you overdid it\nYour shit it, just ain't got that LOUD\nGold tooth shine like TA-DOW!\nBiggie Smalls the illest and how, frays raise your eyebrow\nBy now you figure, he talkin 'bout that nigga\nBut your weak-ass assumptions, lead lead to dumpin'\nIV to pump-in, you're feeling something\nCatch my drift, or catch my four-fifth lift\nAt least six inches, above project fences\nTurn meat to minces, jumps turn to flinches\nWhen I rain I drenches, cleared your park benches\nMissed you by pinches, your talk is senseless\nActor needs chiropractor, for cracked jaw\nYes I rocked, your chatterbox\nDangerous you're not, I gets down\nTwist your body round and round, upside down\n\n[Chorus]\nIs the love really there (is it)\nDo a thug shed the same tear? (never know)\nThrow your ice in the the ear we here\nAnd we all gon ball 'til the courts up here\nDon't give a fuck what them niggas think we talk in here (come on)\nIs the love really there (is it)\nDo a thug shed the same tear? (never know)\nThrow your ice in the the ear we here\nAnd we all gon' ball 'til the courts up here\nDon't give a fuck what them niggas think we talkin in here\n\n[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]\nUhh, smoke a little then we cut coke a little\nAnd we skim a little off of the top\nTaking you back when niggas use to snort coke\nAnd toast through the hood and [?]\nBe the richest folk to float through the hood\nNiggas doin' real good, it was evident\nIn the testament, when coke flow was good\nWhen Ronald Reagan was president\nThe say no to drugs grown greatly irrelevant\nNiggas gettin caught with bricks\nBut still reaching the settlement\nNiggas get a one to three\nCome home in twelve mounts\nRun up and take a niggas shit\nLeave 'em with twelve lumps\nI've never been so willin'\nTo put the thoughts of mo killin'\nInto manufacturing a flow so bone chillin'\nIcy with a pistol, nigga\nShit glitter like ball room chandelier with crystal, nigga\nI stack money as we live life simple\nIn the corner of the club sippin' on a Harvey Bristol, nigga\nC'mon, modern day gangsta shit\nAnd die slow as we give you niggas cancer shit, c'mon\n\n[Chorus]\nIs the love really there (is it)\nDo a thug shed the same tear? (never know)\nThrow your ice in the the ear we here\nAnd we all gon ball 'til the courts up here\nDon't give a fuck what them niggas think we talk in here (come on)\nIs the love really there (is it)\nDo a thug shed the same tear?

nigga murder i got no chemical\nThan courts in Miami water got shit federal\nTime for that ass\nI rather go to little heyday boy some bricks in the station\nHead back long crossed 8 mile to become the boss enforce the Laws\nYou want some motherfuckin' hoes there keep it steppin'\nNo discount player no fuckin' credit\nNo shorts, I came to Governor lost (damn)\nI came to price the dime bribe source\nYou had a devil smokin with them rebels\nWe kill for money and power\nExtortionin' in my own hood and that shit's power\nA black man crime call 'em a coward\nA black man knowledge we kill 'em

snapper, lookin at shorty shakin it and makin it clap\nBooty big pokin out like twenties on the lap\nWhen I give it to her shorty know how to throw it back\nBooty bangin to the beat sometimes we overlap-sing\nGal peel out your blouse and your tight-jeans\nLet me lick you down dip you with some ice-cream\nGal holla holla my name when I slide-in\nThunderstorm, rain, sleet and light-ning\nHold

Why? What do you ask as a reply?\nFlipmode's the Squad don't rest, don't try\nPeace to my people in the friendly sky\nPeace to my outer space ties\n\n[Verse 3: Spliff Star]\nI'm in leather like the

Listeneing to the album as a whole, it is clear that Busta isn\u2019t as inspired under Aftermath as he with previous releases. However, tracks like this demonstrate what Busta Rhymes' booming voice and Dre\u2019s loud yet dynamic beats can do together. After a short vocal sample, an unusual string arrangment creates an erie atmosphere along with the hook (provided by Marsha from Floetry and veteran rapper Q-Tip). Just as Busta Rhymes begins his verse, a short but hard hitting piano arrangment is introduced, and continues throughout the song. While The Big Bang certainly lacked much of what made Busta\u2019s previous works unique, songs such as this (as well as other Dre-produced tracks on the album like Cocaina) stand out by demonstrating what Busta Rhymes is capable of when he is given a well-composed and well-mixed instrumental."}, "embed_content": "<div id='rg_embed_link_8967' class='rg_embed_link' data-song-id='8967'>Read <a

only Aftermath) release, The Big Bang, Busta raps over a Dr. Dre production. Listeneing to the album as a whole, it is clear that Busta isn\u2019t as inspired under Aftermath as he with previous releases. However, tracks like this demonstrate what Busta Rhymes' booming voice and Dre\u2019s loud yet dynamic beats can do together. After a short vocal sample, an unusual string arrangment creates an erie atmosphere along with the hook (provided by Marsha from Floetry and veteran rapper Q-Tip). Just as Busta Rhymes begins his verse, a short but hard hitting piano arrangment is introduced, and continues throughout the song. While The Big Bang certainly lacked much of what made Busta\u2019s previous works unique, songs such as this (as well as other Dre-produced tracks on the album like Cocaina) stand out by demonstrating what Busta Rhymes is capable of when he is given a well-composed and well-mixed instrumental."}, "comment_count": 0, "community": true, "custom_preview": null, "has_voters": true, "id": 3499014,

takin you under back where it all started\nWith a whole new beginnin and a brand new hunger\nStarvin to where my skin was suffocatin my ribs\nNow we got bitches interior decoratin my crib\nTouch the love I got like you holdin my heart in my hand\nAnd watch my manifesto, shit was all a part of the plan\nThe fashion that I choose to deal with this shit\nSometimes it's so hard to describe the passion that I feel for this shit\nHow many struggles I survived just to eat this meal\nNever thought y'all meet a nigga that could be this real\nFlipmode up in this bitch now let me make you aware\nToo late for turnin back my nigga cause we takin it there\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Busta Rhymes]\nGenesis, Genesis, Genesis\nAnd leave!\n\n(Verse 2)\nAnd leave a mark until it's deep in the floor\nY'all

is what niggas be seekin me for\nTestin my strength, that's what the devil's try to weaken me for\nC'mon, yes and y'all off to the next step.. for sure\nRep and make you wanna accept more\nNiggas analyze the jewel that I reveal in a rhyme\nI'm like somethin that has evolved about a million times\nPeep the display with all the new features\nThe way we really doin it, these mu'fuckas probably wouldn't believe us\nFlipmode Squad by all means, a pledge of allegiance\nWith the great feelin of people like the comin of Jesus\nWhile a lot of other niggas don't be tellin you nothin\nThat be the same bullshit that's always pushin my buttons\nGodly is how we rep this undeniable force\nYou like a weak preacher, swearin smacked dead on a cross\nKick niggas like the two back legs of a horse\nChop ya fingers for tryin' to put your hands in the sauce\nSometimes I think that it would be best if you run\nAnd do yourself a favor, cause you got your whole life ahead of you son!\nA whole new thang startin for me\nSmell so much ass in a spot, the beat got the world fartin for me\nWhen I spit you know I always love to garnish it hard\nWhile you love-it hate-it niggas trying to tarnish the God\nI know some dudes that would love to bring the hatred to y'all\nWhile I continue to bless you with shit that's is sacred to y'all\nEven if I had to bend you in place\nI always put it down and rep my

Unh, DMX nigga\nUnh, unh, unh, unh, unh\n\n[Verse 1: DMX]\nI see ghosts clearly; even though, most don't hear me\nThey still wanna get near me (Unh!), fear me, so I'm leary\nKinda eerie what I'm feelin' (What!), from the floor, to the ceilin'\nStraight through the roof, want the truth?\nI kinda miss robbin' and stealin' (C'mon!)\n'Cause it kept a nigga hungry, only eatin' when I starved (Unh!)\nI was ugly, so I robbed, no one loved me, shit was hard (C'mon!)\nWent to God once in a while when it got a little too hectic\nHe was the only one I knew that I respected (Why?)\nDidn't know why, didn't know what I was livin' was a lie\nIf I ain't shit, then, why should I try? (Unh!)\nSee, plenty niggas die, over dumb shit, up in the hood\nReal good heart, but up to no good (Damn!)\nThought I did what I could, but I guess it wasn't enough (Uh-huh)\nThe Devil told me it would happen\nBut I kept callin' his bluff (Uh-huh)\nWhen it rains it pours now, my pains are yours\nAs yours are what's mine, define, revolvin' doors (Nigga!)\n\n[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]\n(Why?)

(we die)\nBecause we Gods, nigga (And) we go the yard nigga\nBecause I walk the ground under my feet (Huh! Ha!)\nAnd keep it live and stay in tune with the street\nNow let me ask my niggas (why?)\n\n[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]\nI must be cuckoo, like I respect the new-you, never\nSee you too could get it through your FUBU sweater\nLike a nigga when he walk in the dark, trespassin'\nOn a nigga land, shots echo loud in the park\nI live and die for all the shit I believe\nAnd rep for everything I stand for\nWith every single breath I breathe\nLike the intake from cigarette smoke, it's like you inhale\nThe demon in the gutter stressed struggled and broke\nIf the shit was all over tomorrow, I'd leave a treasure\nFor my kids with a legacy for my children to follow\nYou know it's funny how the good die first\nGet the peppin' in your steppin' faggot, nigga\n'Cause you could die worse\nHold on, you know I cut off my arm, in the name of reppin'\nReal niggas in the midst of droppin' this bomb\nAllah blessin' me to rep for the better, and carry on\nSomething great and keep a nigga name livin' forever\nNow tell me!\n\n[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]\n(Why?)

colorful shanks\nThat's the way we live, Staten Island kid\nO-Doggin' it, the thug vaccine wit no pork in it\nVivid imagination paper chasin\nDufflebag swollen, we holdin\nDrink chocolate milk before

things\nThis is how we rebuilt shit from the underground up\n\n[Verse 1]\nBounce nigga bounce bounce bounce nigga bounce bounce\nWhen I come through, hit y'all with the one, two\nBreak y'all niggas that y'all niggas won't even know what to do\nBreak fool, make all y'all people wanna come to\nFeel the force of my shit kickin' like it was Kung Fu\nBlast through, don't these corny niggas harass you\nSet a tone in the streets where even the fans blast you\nAsk you niggas, do y'all really want the brand new?\nCorny niggas just finish your time and over, passed due\nHee, ha, what ho, think it's way passed your curfew\nHit you with some shit that make doctors come have to nurse you, you, you, you\nI'm rollin' with my whole crew\nBounce through you niggas whenever we surround you\nFlipmode roll thick, and you know we don't wait\nHit you with some more hits that make y'all wanna go shit, shit, shit\nYo, make y'all niggas jump back\nHit that, hurry and pass the rest of the weed black\n\n[Chorus]\nRep my crew yo, Flipmode hit you off\nYo, y'all know what to do okay, tear the roof off\nOff, off, off,  tear the roof off, yo\nY'all know what do I'm sayin', tear the roof off\nRep my crew yo, Flipmode hit you off\nYo, y'all know what to do okay, tear the roof off\nOff, off, off,  tear the roof off, yo\nY'all know what do I'm sayin', tear the roof off\n\n[Verse 2]\nOne more time I hit y'all with a crime\nWhile I be in my rhyme I hear that a drop of a dime\nWildin' all in my Tim boots\nNow we stackin' mad loot\nEverybody holdin' and 21 gun, salute\nAnyway any how, I'ma give it to you now\nYou ain't wildin' my nigga, that is something I won't allow\nOne two three four, I be knockin' at your door\nHit y'all niggas with an effect that y'all never felt before\nOr leave you with somemore freaky dicky metaphor\nRep for all my niggas who stay reppin' the hardcore\nSlug it out, bugging out, all off my niggas thug it out\nTired of all these weak niggas now I'ma rub you out\nYo, what you talkin' 'bout, make y'all niggas scream and shout\nYo, we bout to blast you out the spot my nigga no doubt, doubt, doubt, doubt\nYo, you know we always stay on\nKeep wildin' before you know it the entire day is gone\nLeft, right, left, yo, no need to hold your breath\nYo, better chill your body up while we beat you to death, death, death, death, death\nBlast you right through your chest\nYo, you know we runnin' shit and we never settle for less, yo\n\n[Chorus]\nRep my crew yo, Flipmode hit you off\nYo, y'all know what to do okay, tear the roof off\nOff, off, off,  tear the roof off, yo\nY'all know what do I'm sayin', tear the roof off\nRep my crew yo, Flipmode hit you off\nYo, y'all know what to do okay, tear the roof off\nOff, off, off,  tear the roof off, yo\nY'all know what do I'm sayin', tear the roof off\nRep my crew yo, Flipmode hit you off\nYo, y'all know what to do okay, tear the roof off\nOff, off, off,  tear the roof off, yo\nY'all know what do I'm sayin', tear the roof off\nRep my crew yo, Flipmode hit you off\nYo, y'all know what to do okay, tear the roof off\nOff, off, off,  tear the roof off, yo\nY'all know what do I'm sayin', tear the roof off\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, motherfuckers\nFlipmode Squad eternally imperial, powerful, universal\nFlipmode Squad, from the underground up motherfuckers\nAlways remember that\nFrom the underground up\nWe

(wha)\nNo Limit nigga (wha)\nFlipmode nigga (wha)\nNo Limit nigga (wha)\nFlipmode nigga\nYo yo yo (Here we go)\n\n[Verse 1: Mystikal]\n\nCoincide with yo boy check out with no lines\nOn yo boy look out but don't hide\nWhen you bust it up and keep rhymes\nWhen you walk towards the tape offline\nFor your boys got instinct rhymes\nWhen you bump between the sixteen lines\nWhen you bowl win the goal bitches scream\nWin the goal keep ahead keep it live\nBefore you go get your tattoo rhymes\nFor your boy pick a bell in the bathroom\nPenalized doing it till he get tired of ya boy\nThat shit between me and you niggas\nThen trying to figure out what I say\nI give less than a fuck, what you doing over there\nJust don't get in my way\nHear my records feel my presence now and forever and until\nStop what you doing and work it fuck it nice\nJust complete it with a licking to the man right there\nTell you mother fuckerswhat we came to do\nIt's just plain as day but they don't wanna see\nIf you don't wanna fight get the fuck is you'll be\nIn the spot working on my beat\nLong time I'm having no compromise\nI'mma open them up and them I'm dumping them out\nI'm keeping it hard so don't get mad\nCause I'm loading 'em up and I'm running 'em out\nHit 'em with the bang then I feel a bang\nTake her in the backyard outside leave 'em in the rain\nTeach the niggas not to fuck with us\nAnd next year we gon do the same thing and\n\nChorus (2x):\nNow who you is nigga?\nI'm Mystikal nigga\nNow who you is nigga?\nI'm Busta Rhymes nigga\nNow is they wildin with us\nAnd getting rowdy with us\nNow is they wildin with us\nAnd getting rowdy with us\n\n[Verse 2: Busta]\n\nYo yo yo yo yo yo\nMe and my nigga Mystikal make a plan that generate\nSufficient amount of funds across many lands\nGenerate the heat the place radiate\nWhen I break shit I drop create a earthquake\nYo, anyway we still double masking\nAnd get the gambit and eat super pie niggas\nAll over the track with a kick in your back\nI know we making you black\nAnd you stay fucking with that\nYou my niggas is platinum\nCan you deal with the fact?\nMe and the fact getting money\nWith my name on the plaque\nYou know how I blow the spot\nYou niggas can't fuck with what I got\nNigga please\nOoh nigga you don't need me to smoke trees\nNigga freefall make you feel some of these\nOh by hollow tips pinned in your ass\nGet off the Earth the fact that you even in my class\nYo\nAll my live bitches get over here\nAnd all my live bitches get with the niggas right there\nAll you other niggas get in the rear\nAll you weak funny niggas you better stand clear\nCome inside of my storm put on your gear\nYou ain't up here my nigga better be up outta here\nYo, when we come you know we the one\nWe only here to get money till the whole shit done\n\nChorus (2x):\n\nFlipmode wildin wildin\nYeah y'all wildin wildin\nNo Limit rowdy rowdy\nGetting rowdy rowdy\nBusta Rhymes wildin wildin\nYeah you wildin wildin\nMystikal rowdy rowdy\nGettin rowdy rowdy\nFlipmode wildin wildin\nYeah y'all wildin wildin\nNo Limit rowdy rowdy\nGetting rowdy rowdy\nBusta Rhymes wildin wildin\nYeah you wildin wildin\nMystikal rowdy rowdy\nYou getting rowdy rowdy\nWhat\nMystikal and Busta Rhymes\nBusta Rhymes and Mystikal\nNo Limit and Flipmode\nFlipmode and No Limit\nWhat you talking bout nigga what what\nWhat the fuck nigga\nWhat you want

Beat 'em\nVillain teach you where to score some old concrete crumbs\nWord is Gold Bond feets powder, corned thumbs\n\u2018specially in the summer bless the drummer, warned \u2018em\nTight your cleats, or else its right to the white meat\nSome I bite to eat, others write the light bright heat\nDespite threat regardless of the aspect, the shack, the burning holes through his black neck, fact check\nNo flicks, and he scam, thought alot with the quicks\nLike the mini camcorder box, it\u2019s a brick lick, Classic\nAs we stalk the great outdoors\nOnly use the magic nowadays to talk them out they drawers, but um\nBefore he go there let me take it where it started from\nSmart kid sold some snake spit to a 'tarded bum\nNot without carding em\u2019, Mr. Guardin'-em\nFind me in the mid-90s Midnight Mauraden-em\nHard, they wanted no part of him\nMore rhymes and ways to get paid, and there\u2019s a lot of them\nGreat minds see alike take a sneak peek\nPeek one foot out and still leave deep\nNo frontin' if you ain\u2019t go huntin' or southern, you definitely ain\u2019t gon \u2018run em\n\n[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]\nIn the streets is where you witness the worship happen in public\nWhere babies grow and turn into killers and and how they become it\nThey evolve as a result of not having food in the cupboard\nKnowing that the shit they be doing is foul and grow to love it\nWhere the shit is never staged, every presentation is live\nSome'll bang and turn crip and probably start whipping a five\nBut every now and then you find the mind of a child that has triumphed\nUnique characteristics and deals with a higher science\nAspiring to take over the world and really does it\nAll one-hundred ninety-six million nine-hundred forty thousand square miles of it\nDamn it's strange how shit change\nBut when you look again, ironically some shit is still the same\nBut in these streets you'll probably find a nigga regularly dreaming\nPaying attention to everything, regularly scheming\nTrying to calculate the next hustle without attracting heat\nThere be so many different things that be going down\nWhere bodies get clapped floating in oceans\nIt's where the suffering can callous your emotion\nBut parents pray for their children, constantly hoping that their babies don\u2019t end up killed (in jail) or smoking\nIt's where you learn to make things out of nothing\nWhere people smoke crack instead of taking a Buffrin\nDespite the Santa, the ratchet bussin' is common\nWith what we lived, to most other people it's foreign\n\n[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]\nTo be from the streets it\u2019s a blessing, it\u2019s a blessing\nIt teach the most unforgettable lesson, yeah lesson\nSo a nigga from the street, don\u2019t test him, don\u2019t test him\nWhere most niggas probably get killed\nEven babies busy fighting over breast milk\nThe streets'll help you get your soul right\nHope them wolves don\u2019t get ya standing in the street light\nAnd if them wolves catch you night night\nWhen your boxers in the dirt and eating Popeye\u2019s\nAnd don\u2019t forget my hot sauce\nGet your mind watching loot and get your life lost\n\n[Verse 3: MF DOOM]\nIt\u2019s like a jungle 24/7 365.44\nI score gorilla war tour, yeah sure sure\nWhen push comes to shove\nThis world done beef\nBut it\u2019s still done love\n\n[Verse 4: Busta Rhymes]\nOn more than likely a level of hate that you can\u2019t imagine\nWhere desperate acts occur cause of hunger beyond famine\nWhere instead of friends your ratchet becomes your closest companion\nAnd when its beef your leave bodies with holes the size on canyons\n\n[Verse 5: MF DOOM]\nOn her strength she wasn\u2019t lent 3 cent\nGot her own connect for free rent off the cement\nNow what if that was your moms?\nShort arm, quart of water to bottles of Don\nBought the farm\n\n[Verse 6: Busta Rhymes]\nYo the streets consist abundantly of happiness and sorrow\nIt\u2019s also where you lurk to secure your food for tomorrow\nWhere we take the shit \u2018cause we ain\u2019t paying it back if we borrow\nBecome the one that shine so the rest of the hood can follow\n\n[Hook: BJTheChicagoKid]\nStreet, to be from the streets it\u2019s a blessing, it\u2019s a blessing\nIt teach the most unforgettable lesson, yeah lesson\nSo a nigga from the street, don\u2019t test him, don\u2019t test him\nWhere most niggas probably get killed\nEven babies busy fighting over breast milk\nThe streets'll help you get your soul right\nHope them wolves get you standing in the street light\nAnd if them wolves catch you

public\nWhere babies grow and turn into killers and and how they become it\nThey evolve as a result of not having food in the cupboard\nKnowing that the shit they be doing is foul and grow to love it\nWhere the shit is never staged, every presentation is live\nSome'll bang and turn crip and probably start whipping a five\nBut every now and then you find the mind of a child that has triumphed\nUnique characteristics and deals with a higher science\nAspiring to take over the world and really does it\nAll one-hundred ninety-six million nine-hundred forty thousand square miles of it\nDamn it's strange how shit change\nBut when you look again, ironically some shit is still the same\nBut in these streets you'll probably find a nigga regularly dreaming\nPaying attention to everything, regularly scheming\nTrying to calculate the next hustle without attracting heat\nThere be so many different things that be going down\nWhere bodies get clapped floating in oceans\nIt's where the suffering can callous your emotion\nBut parents pray for their children, constantly hoping that their babies don\u2019t end up killed (in jail) or smoking\nIt's where you learn to make things out of nothing\nWhere people smoke crack instead of taking a Buffrin\nDespite the Santa, the ratchet bussin' is common\nWith what we lived, to most other people it's foreign\n\n[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]\nTo be from the streets it\u2019s a blessing, it\u2019s a blessing\nIt teach the most unforgettable lesson, yeah lesson\nSo a nigga from the street, don\u2019t test him, don\u2019t test him\nWhere most niggas probably get killed\nEven babies busy fighting over breast milk\nThe streets'll help you get your soul right\nHope them wolves don\u2019t get ya standing in the street light\nAnd if them wolves catch you night night\nWhen your boxers in the dirt and eating Popeye\u2019s\nAnd don\u2019t forget my hot sauce\nGet your mind watching loot and get your life lost\n\n[Verse 3: MF DOOM]\nIt\u2019s like a jungle 24/7 365.44\nI score gorilla war tour, yeah sure sure\nWhen push comes to shove\nThis world done beef\nBut it\u2019s still done love\n\n[Verse 4: Busta Rhymes]\nOn more than likely a level of hate that you can\u2019t imagine\nWhere desperate acts occur cause of hunger beyond famine\nWhere instead of friends your ratchet becomes your closest companion\nAnd when its beef your leave bodies with holes the size on canyons\n\n[Verse 5: MF DOOM]\nOn her strength she wasn\u2019t lent 3 cent\nGot her own connect for free rent off the cement\nNow what if that was your moms?\nShort arm, quart of water to bottles of Don\nBought the farm\n\n[Verse 6: Busta Rhymes]\nYo the streets consist abundantly of happiness and sorrow\nIt\u2019s also where you lurk to secure your food for tomorrow\nWhere we take the shit \u2018cause we ain\u2019t paying it back if we borrow\nBecome the one that shine so the rest of the hood can follow\n\n[Hook: BJTheChicagoKid]\nStreet, to be from the streets it\u2019s a blessing, it\u2019s a blessing\nIt teach the most unforgettable lesson, yeah lesson\nSo a nigga from the street, don\u2019t test him, don\u2019t test him\nWhere most niggas probably get killed\nEven babies busy fighting over breast milk\nThe streets'll help you get your soul right\nHope them wolves get you standing in the street light\nAnd if them wolves catch you night night\nWhen your boxers in the dirt and eating Popeye\u2019s\nAnd don\u2019t forget my hot sauce\nGet your mind watching loot and get your life lost"}}, {"title": "God's Plan", "album": "The

while you secure the food to come through\nNow don't let my ambition make you feel like competition\nWe should both play a role in our whole livin condition (true indeed)\nI know you symbolize the strength inside the family\nThen show me you can handle womanly responsibilities\nNot a problem I know you hold me down when I fall on the ground\nBut make sure when you bring the food home there's enough to go 'round\nAnd because you are my everything what's mine is yours\nMovin in the same direction, just for one common cause\n\n[Chorus: Busta Rhymes & Erykah Badu]\nJust one, opportunity to handle our biz\nJust one, mindstate so we can equally live\nJust one, you know we only have one life to live\nJust one, come together as one\nAs one, one family\nAs one, one little kiss now\nAs one, one entirety\nAs one, and let us all uplift now\nAs one, one family\nAs one, one little kiss now\nAs one, one entirety\nAs one, and let us all uplift now", "image":

Fun, natural fun\nI said what I'm gon' do with my man Busta Rhymes, I'm gonna have some fun\nWhat do you consider fun? Fun, natural fun\nUh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh uh-huh\nBusta Rhymes, Erykah Badu y'all, just one\nOne love everybody just one\n\n[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]\nWell as I universally greet the whole entire world\nAnd focus on the energy that'll make your skin curl\nThe one strategy, the one universal plan\nThe master blueprint, one survival for all man\nI Self Lord - AM, so divine\nWhen me and my woman coincide as one mind; bear witness\nOne respect, one culture, one way of thinkin\nOne vision, makin the one decision on one WAY of livin!\nCommon destiny amongst all\nOne understanding amongst me and my woman, so that we can't fall\nAnd keep movin forward based on actual fact\nYes y'all, my beautiful Mother Earth, respect her to the max\nCan't mix dilute or tamper with us no more\nWe on the highest form of emotion, holy sacred and pure\nAnd what's mines is yours, especially if we move\nIn the same direction just for ONE common cause\n\n[Chorus: Busta Rhymes & Erykah Badu]\nJust one, opportunity to handle our biz\nJust one, mindstate so we can equally live\nJust one, you know we only have one life to live\nJust one, come together as one\nAs one, one family\nAs one, one little kiss now\nAs one, one entirety\nAs one, and let us all uplift now (talk to me, baby)\n\n[Verse 2: Erykah Badu]\nI value (uh-huh uh huh) that I've found me (what what)\nI gave you tea (that's right, girl) you shed degree (oh yes, love)\nA family (one family, baby) is what we be (uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah)\nSo that you'll see (right) c'mon\n\n[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]\nAyo, ayo\nI know my woman's love for me, the way she cherish me\nFulfill my every appetite for the God Degree\nAlways inspire my encouragement, the right amount of nourishment\nSecure enough so I don't have to ask her where my loving went\nWhen times is hopeless, sometimes I had to focus\nOn the priceless moments, when my Wisdom Body wouldn't notice\n'Cause you're my everything, what's mines'll be yours\nMovin in the same direction just for one common cause\n\n[Chorus: Busta Rhymes & Erykah Badu]\nJust one, opportunity to handle our biz\nJust one, mindstate so we can equally live\nJust one, you know we only have one life to live\nJust one, come together as one\nAs one, one family\nAs one, one little kiss now\nAs one, one entirety\nAs one, and let us all uplift now\n\n[Verse 4: Erykah Badu & Busta Rhymes]\nAs my sunlight, I bear witness to you\nBein the foundation, you can come home and watch the babies too\n(The one way we agree on how to follow tradition)\nThis one family come in thirds, play your position\nYou make the sacrifices, I make the same too\n(From all the struggle) that I see, that's why my love is for you\nYou always hold it down for me, so I'ma hold it for you\nAnd watch the babies

combine and intertwine\nThe bounce rock skates make you cross the foul line\nShine a nickel nine\nOn all kinds of little swine\nStick the worst of porcupine\nIf you tryin' to take mine\nYo, pick up my nigga Spliff\nIn the blue 5S's\nSportin' out tan, interior blue head rests\nMove, baby no time for second guesses\nBeen articulate the right bounce as the flow finesses\nYo we gettin' papers spreadin' love and happiness's\nShit blazin' so hot DJ's scratch the test presses\nLike make it mo' hot baby\n\n[Chorus]\nTurn it up, I wanna hear it real loud, just\nTurn it up, so we can party in the loft, baby\nTurn it up, we need to tear the roof off, so just\nTurn it up, I need to make it mo hot, baby\n\n[Verse 2]\nYo, word is bond\nBaby let's get it on\nI never say it wrong\nYo baby girl take off your thong\nLet me put it in your spirit like the holy Qur'an\nGot the mega song\nSweet like honey chicken Dijon\nMovin' along\nYo, honey body look real strong\nWatch your ass swing\nHangin' like a medallion\nExercise baby let me see you spread on the floor\nWhat you askin' for?\nRelax, I'm bout to give you some more\nWhere the liquor store?\nHit you with some more metaphor\nThe raw, hot to def shit you never seen it before\nHit the deck, on your mark, get set, we bout to jet\nSpark it like ingelet, chickens breakin' their neck\nYo we play to win\nSuch a shame, shit is a sin\nSo hot baby body heat bubble your skin\nEvery time I flow speak\nI caress the whole beach\nJust like the body guard Les straight walkin' the street\nWe get down\n\n[Chorus]\nTurn it up, I wanna hear it real loud, just\nTurn it up, so we can party in the loft, baby\nTurn it up, we need to tear the roof off, so just\nTurn it up, I need to make it mo hot, baby\n\n[Verse 3]\nYo, come on baby just feel my heat wave\nA lot of hot ones ready for niggas that act brave\nChill son, you better off if you behave\nFlip money while broke niggas tryin' to save\nLay low, I say so, my pesos\nImport my cheese stack by the castros\nMake clothes\nOr stay fly a chase hoes\nEquatorians soft lips and straight nose\nMakin' dough\nWhen we rippin' the paid show\nGet the money and dip, we in the Range Rove\nNow we makin' grands\nWe name brand\nWe make plans, change plans\nThen we expand across land\nDo it properly\nYo, I said open sesame\nThe recipe, be the hot shit, it's got to be\nYo, landscape\nWe arrange a whole shape\nRock the fly tape\nThen I continue to sky scrape\nLike blah!\nSo hot\n\n[Chorus]\nTurn it up, I wanna hear it real loud, just\nTurn it up, so we can party in the loft, baby\nTurn it up, we need to tear the roof off, so just\nTurn it up, I need to make it mo hot, baby", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c81a637e4015a2a4f63a6790ebd3ee6f.1000x1000x1.png", "artist": "Busta Rhymes", "raw":

overdrive\nBounce, baby feel the incline\nSo genuine, every time, Busta redefine\nThe wicked knew the dime\nMakin' y'all press rewind\nHope you feelin' fine\nWatch me combine and intertwine\nThe bounce rock skates make you cross the foul line\nShine a nickel nine\nOn all kinds of little swine\nStick the worst of porcupine\nIf you tryin' to take mine\nYo, pick up my nigga Spliff\nIn the blue 5S's\nSportin' out tan, interior blue head rests\nMove, baby no time for second guesses\nBeen articulate the right bounce as the flow finesses\nYo we gettin' papers spreadin' love and happiness's\nShit blazin' so hot DJ's scratch the test presses\nLike make it mo' hot baby\n\n[Chorus]\nTurn it up, I wanna hear it real loud, just\nTurn it up, so we can party in the loft, baby\nTurn it up, we need to tear the roof off, so just\nTurn it up, I need to make it mo hot, baby\n\n[Verse 2]\nYo, word is bond\nBaby let's get it on\nI never say it wrong\nYo baby girl take off your thong\nLet me put it in your spirit like the holy Qur'an\nGot the mega song\nSweet like honey chicken Dijon\nMovin' along\nYo, honey body look real strong\nWatch your ass swing\nHangin' like a medallion\nExercise baby let me see you spread on the floor\nWhat you askin' for?\nRelax, I'm bout to give you some more\nWhere the liquor store?\nHit you with some more metaphor\nThe raw, hot to def shit you never seen it before\nHit the deck, on your mark, get set, we bout to jet\nSpark it like ingelet, chickens breakin' their neck\nYo we play to win\nSuch a shame, shit is a sin\nSo hot baby body heat bubble your skin\nEvery time I flow speak\nI caress the whole beach\nJust like the body guard Les straight walkin' the street\nWe get down\n\n[Chorus]\nTurn it up, I wanna hear it real loud, just\nTurn it up, so we can party in the loft, baby\nTurn it up, we need to tear the roof off, so just\nTurn it up, I need to make it mo hot, baby\n\n[Verse 3]\nYo, come on baby just feel my heat wave\nA lot of hot ones ready for niggas that act brave\nChill son, you better off if you behave\nFlip money while broke niggas tryin' to save\nLay low, I say so, my pesos\nImport my cheese stack by the castros\nMake clothes\nOr stay fly a chase hoes\nEquatorians soft lips and straight nose\nMakin' dough\nWhen we rippin' the paid show\nGet the money and dip, we in the Range Rove\nNow we makin' grands\nWe name brand\nWe make plans, change plans\nThen we expand across land\nDo it properly\nYo, I said open sesame\nThe recipe, be the hot shit, it's got to be\nYo, landscape\nWe arrange a whole shape\nRock the fly tape\nThen I continue to sky scrape\nLike blah!\nSo hot\n\n[Chorus]\nTurn it up, I wanna hear it real loud, just\nTurn it up, so we can party in the loft, baby\nTurn it up, we need to tear the roof off, so just\nTurn it up, I need to make it mo hot, baby"}}, {"title": "Give It to Me", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "Baby if you give it to me, I'll give it to you\nI know

be peaches & cream.\nBut I'm afraid the end time is near\nThe cataclysmic apocalypse referred to in the scriptures of every holy book known to mankind\nIt will be an Era fraught with boundless greed & corruption\nWhere global monetary systems disintegrate, leaving brother to kill brother for a grain of overcooked rice\nThe nations of the civilized world will collapse under the impressive weight of parasitic political conspiracies which remove all hope & optimism from their once faithful citizens\nAround the globe, generations of polluters will be punished for their sins\nUn-shielded by the ozone layer they have successfully depleted\nLeft to bake in the searing naked rays of light\nWholesale assassinations served to destabilize every remaining government\nLeaving the starving & wicked to fend for themselves\nBloodthirsty renegade cyborgs created by tax-dodging corporations wreck havok\nPissed off androids tired of being slaves to a godless & gutless system, where the rich get richer & the poor get fucked over and out\nUnleash total worldwide destruction by means of nuclear holocaust\nAnnihilating the terrified masses\nLeaving in its torturous wake nothing but vicious, cannibalistic, mutated, radiating, and horribly disfigured hordes of satanic killers\nBegged on revenge, but against whom?\nThere are so few left alive\nStarvation reigns supreme, forcing unlucky survivors to eat anything & anyone in their path\nMassive earthquakes crack the planets crust like a hollow eggshell\nCausing unending volcanic eruptions\nThe creatures of the seven seas, unable to escape the certain death upon land, boil in their liquid prison\nDisease then circles the earth, plagues & viruses with no known cause or cure\nLaying waste to whatever draws breath, and human-kind having proven itself to be nothing more than a race of ruthless scavengers\nFall victim to merciless attacks at the hands of interplanetary alien tribes who seek to conquer our charred remains\nThis is, Extinction Level Event\nThe Final World Front, and there is only, one, year, left\nWow, that's cool, I can't hardly wait!\nYou don't have to, because here it is\n\n[Outro: Busta Rhymes]\nCallin' all live niggas\nCallin' all live bitches\nWe got a job for y'all on planet earth\nFlipmode world domination in progress\nMotherfuckers", "image":

near\nThe cataclysmic apocalypse referred to in the scriptures of every holy book known to mankind\nIt will be an Era fraught with boundless greed & corruption\nWhere global monetary systems disintegrate, leaving brother to kill brother for a grain of overcooked rice\nThe nations of the civilized world will collapse under the impressive weight of parasitic political conspiracies which remove all hope & optimism from their once faithful citizens\nAround the globe, generations of polluters will be punished for their sins\nUn-shielded by the ozone layer they have successfully depleted\nLeft to bake in the searing naked rays of light\nWholesale assassinations served to destabilize every remaining government\nLeaving the starving & wicked to fend for themselves\nBloodthirsty renegade cyborgs created by tax-dodging corporations wreck havok\nPissed off androids tired of being slaves to a godless & gutless system, where the rich get richer & the poor get fucked over and out\nUnleash total worldwide destruction by means of nuclear holocaust\nAnnihilating the terrified masses\nLeaving in its torturous wake nothing but vicious, cannibalistic, mutated, radiating, and horribly disfigured hordes of satanic killers\nBegged on revenge, but against whom?\nThere are so few left alive\nStarvation reigns supreme, forcing unlucky survivors to eat anything & anyone in their path\nMassive earthquakes crack the planets crust like a hollow eggshell\nCausing unending volcanic eruptions\nThe creatures of the seven seas, unable to escape the certain death upon land, boil in their liquid prison\nDisease then circles the earth, plagues & viruses with no known cause or cure\nLaying waste to whatever draws breath, and human-kind having proven itself to be nothing more than a race of ruthless scavengers\nFall victim to merciless attacks at the hands of interplanetary alien tribes who seek to conquer our charred remains\nThis is, Extinction Level Event\nThe Final World Front, and there is only, one, year, left\nWow, that's cool, I can't hardly wait!\nYou don't have to, because here it is\n\n[Outro: Busta Rhymes]\nCallin' all live niggas\nCallin' all live bitches\nWe got a job for y'all on planet earth\nFlipmode world domination in progress\nMotherfuckers"}}, {"title": "World Go Round", "album": "Back on My B.S.", "year": "2009-04-06", "lyrics": "[Busta Rhymes]\nLook, it's been a long time, I shouldn'ta left you\nBut now I came back to step through\nThink of how many weak dudes you heard boo\nTime's up, sorry I let you\nListen to them, you see I'm back with a gem\nAnd you knowin that I'mma always keep it hot 'til the end\nAnd again and again, that's how we\n\n[Estelle]\nMake the world go round\nRound, ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh-ahh\nGo round, round, ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh-ahh\nGo round, round, ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh-ahh\nGo round, round, ah-ah-ah-ah go round\n\n[Busta Rhymes]\nAy, AY! Just feel my presence\nBetter than ever, back with a vengeance\nAh hey, slide on baby just ride on\nI give ya, e'rything people rely on\nMy nigga, the heat that meat gets fried on\nStill'll, drop shit to murder the club\nCall it a killa, stand up with my back on the wall\nAnd let her throw her ass, that's what a thug do\nPut it down, rep how we rep, niggas know we ball\nIf you ain't know we bought out the club too\nBaby girl get it - let's swing it\nRight back to the crib then I hit it, she love the way I spit it\nHuh! See when I come they love how I'm movin it\nThey worship the kid and the way I'm really doin it\nShit, make baby girl moist\nI'm steppin in the club, valet the Rolls Royce\n\n[Hook: Estelle]\nFilthy talkin, bottle poppin\nDisco rockin, park, go party\nI feel life, money and Cashmere\nThese things, make the world go round\nRound, ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh-ahh\nGo round, round, ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh-ahh\nGo round, round, ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh-ahh\nGo round, round, ah-ah-ah-ah go round\n\n[Busta Rhymes]\nNow what the hell are you lookin for?\nWatch how a nigga bring the ceilin to the floor\nSee the way I do and get a little raw now\nBreak somethin, see the way we kickin in the door now\nWhen I come see a Range and a Porsche now\nDo what I say, women to the floor now\nMore is what I'm comin to get\nWorld tours now, nigga charter the jet\nGot, women sweatin and they ready and they willin I\nCome to the telly and they steady doin the diddy bop\nHit you with it, sh-sh-sh-sh-shorty gettin really hot\nPretty with it, the way a bitch can make the city stop\nWhyle all night, mami know the routine\nStyle so right - and I'm creatin a new scene\nBass seem to make mami come and put it on ya\nWhile I give it to ya cause you know I'm back to DO IT for ya!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Busta Rhymes]\nAnd away we go - off to the next spot\nFirst 5 is a little club kinda hot\nFirst on the scene, see the blunt fire spark\nSnatch shorty, take her to the corner where it's dark\nNow, shorty breathin all heavy, hands all on me\nThen she turn around and try to put her ass on me\nI ain't payin no mind\n'til I seen her crew waitin on the Soul Train line\nNow, shorty workin hard tryin to get with me\nWanna take me to the bathroom tryin to give me quickie\nBut - I ain't trickin on 'em like my name Tricky\nWhen they smell my cologne they wanna try to give me hickie\nLike kissin and huggin and suckin on my wrist full of diamonds\nMove slow, I'll tuck your little chick in my pocket\nType of shit I do all day\nLike the last broad to the show stay, okay?\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f98950948e4d586d256bb83ec370957b.180x180x1.jpg", "artist": "Busta Rhymes", "raw": {"annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/8961",

you\nListen to them, you see I'm back with a gem\nAnd you knowin that I'mma always keep it hot 'til the end\nAnd again and again, that's how we\n\n[Estelle]\nMake the world go round\nRound, ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh-ahh\nGo round, round, ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh-ahh\nGo round, round, ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh-ahh\nGo round, round, ah-ah-ah-ah go round\n\n[Busta Rhymes]\nAy, AY! Just feel my presence\nBetter than ever, back with a vengeance\nAh hey, slide on baby just ride on\nI give ya, e'rything people rely on\nMy nigga, the heat that meat gets fried on\nStill'll, drop shit to murder the club\nCall it a killa, stand up with my back on the wall\nAnd let her throw her ass, that's what a thug do\nPut it down, rep how we rep, niggas know we ball\nIf you ain't know we bought out the club too\nBaby girl get it - let's swing it\nRight back to the crib then I hit it, she love the way I spit it\nHuh! See when I come they love how I'm movin it\nThey worship the kid and the way I'm really doin it\nShit, make baby girl moist\nI'm steppin in the club, valet the Rolls Royce\n\n[Hook: Estelle]\nFilthy talkin, bottle poppin\nDisco rockin, park, go party\nI feel life, money and Cashmere\nThese things, make the world go round\nRound, ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh-ahh\nGo round, round, ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh-ahh\nGo round, round, ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh-ahh\nGo round, round, ah-ah-ah-ah go round\n\n[Busta Rhymes]\nNow what the hell are you lookin for?\nWatch how a nigga bring the ceilin to the floor\nSee the way I do and get a little raw now\nBreak somethin, see the way we kickin in the door now\nWhen I come see a Range and a Porsche now\nDo what I say, women to the floor now\nMore is what I'm comin to get\nWorld tours now, nigga charter the jet\nGot, women sweatin and they ready and they willin I\nCome to the telly and they steady doin the diddy bop\nHit you with it, sh-sh-sh-sh-shorty gettin really hot\nPretty with it, the way a bitch can make the city stop\nWhyle all night, mami know the routine\nStyle so right - and I'm creatin a new scene\nBass seem to make mami come and put it on ya\nWhile I give it to ya cause you know I'm back to DO IT for ya!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Busta Rhymes]\nAnd away we go - off to the next spot\nFirst 5 is a little club kinda hot\nFirst on the scene, see the blunt fire spark\nSnatch shorty, take her to the corner where it's dark\nNow, shorty breathin all heavy, hands all on me\nThen she turn around and try to put her ass on me\nI ain't payin no mind\n'til I seen her crew waitin on the Soul Train line\nNow, shorty workin hard tryin to get with me\nWanna take me to the bathroom tryin to give me quickie\nBut - I ain't trickin on 'em like my name Tricky\nWhen they smell my cologne they wanna try to give me hickie\nLike kissin and huggin and suckin on my wrist full of diamonds\nMove slow, I'll tuck your little chick in my pocket\nType of shit I do all day\nLike the last broad to the show stay, okay?\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "Don't Touch Me", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "This is a national security alert\nGround music\nFlipmode\nAftermath\n\nHere we go!\n\nBack with the

regular\nThat's with the, fly 80's nigga that was whipping in a Creseda\nFresher than, most of these niggas killing the rest of them\nVillains that was thinking that they rushing in and busting in\nBut the way we was doing, we was muscling their hustling\n\nSo, don't touch me nigga, you might burn yourself (Ha)\nDon't touch me nigga, you might burn yourself\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch, so throw the water on 'em (Hey)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch, so throw the water on 'em (Hey)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch, so throw the water on 'em (Hey)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch, so throw the water on 'em (Hey)\n\nHere we go!\n\nYou don't really want it my dude\nI'm saying most my niggas is rude\nAnd when we come, we eat a nigga food\nBack to the fact of the matter at hand\nFor me to come and control this whole shit, was only part of the plan\nThe other part of the plan, for you to understand\nThat nothing can fuck with the kid, Let me say it again!\n\nThe Broad Back B, Busta Bust back to put out the trash\nAnd just for the record we got it on smash, now\nHow the fuck they even got the audacity\nTo fire marshal come and try to talk about the capacity\nEvery time I'm in the spot I hope you know it has to be\nExtremely packed to shut it down you'll probably cause a tragedy\n\nDon't you know that when I'm in the place I change the mood again\nI be wilding with raunchy bitches and a bunch of hooligans\n\nNow don't get it fucked up just because I flaunt it\nNiggas think that they can test me bring it if you really want it\nSee I be the type to always beat you to the punch faster\nI keep a smile on my face but carry the bush master\n\nSo, don't touch me nigga, you might burn yourself (Ha)\nDon't touch me nigga, you might burn yourself\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch, so throw the water on 'em (Hey)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch, so throw the water on 'em (Hey)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch, so throw the water on 'em (Hey)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch, so throw the water on 'em (Hey)\n\nKeep it going!\n\nYou already know I said it word to mother\nShit is so hot you niggas think its cold up in the summer\nShh - calm the noise down lets get a little quiet\nCause the neighbors call the police, they know we cause riots\nAnd they know that we'll have them thinking they dancing with the devil\nWhen they play the music turn the volume to the highest level\n(Breathe in, breathe out, and sigh)\nYou got it right let's keep the bombs going\nLike we lit a stick Of dynamite now you know\nYou need to follow whenever you hear the god spit, Aww shit!\nYou see me nigga back in the cockpit\nI be getting this money I'll give you all a stock tip\nFirst buy a nigga till you see the sweat drop, drip\n\nSo, don't touch me nigga, you might burn yourself (Ha)\nDon't touch me nigga, you might burn yourself\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch, so throw the water on 'em (Hey)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch, so throw the water on 'em (Hey)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch, so throw the water on 'em (Hey)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch, so throw the water on 'em (Hey)"}}, {"title": "Turn Me Up Some", "album": "It Ain't Safe No More...", "year": "2002-11-26", "lyrics": "[Intro: Busta Rhymes + (Redman)]\n(Barking) Yeah (Turn me up some)\nFuck goin' on; yo Uncle Darren, what up brother\nYeah, yeah\nFlipmode!\nSee we got a whole...\nWe got a gift-wrapped package for you motherfuckers\nYeah, yo, yo, yo, yeah\nBust it\n\n[Verse 1]\nI stay rippin' a nigga tracks so\nHotter than wax, yo, so tell me why you act so\nYo, I max 'cause I make a nigga black 'til its time to relax yo\nUntil you all collapse so, fuck it\nIt's hardly that the god is getting tired\nYou don't wanna say that\nCan catch a cardiac relapse, nigga\nWhat, the god is back so you don't want nuthin'\nNo matter how you react\nBlows that black and blue your front and your back\nChoose, whatever the route that you choose\nWounds so horrendous forensics will get to analyzing the bruise\nBlows will never come in singular, they coming in twos\nMy crew be starting the ruckus once I give them the cues\nTo blast from the triggers that'll bust from all of my dudes\nBe the shit that make you niggas run up out of your shoes\nWe make you back down, having the facts down\nWith all the noise you be making you can even see the shit on the news\nWord up\n\n[Chorus: Busta Rhymes + (Redman)]\nSo you don't know nuthin' about it\n(Barking...Turn me up some)\nYo, the heat from of the street will burn you up some\nYo, the shit I'm sure to spit will hurt you up some\nI'm sayin'\nBut you don't know nuthin' about it\n(Barking...Turn me up some)\nYo, I drink a fifth of yack and hurl it up some\nYo, just bang it in the truck and turn it up some\nI'm sayin'...\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow watch me get a nigga fast, like them bitches with no ass\nYou corny niggas low class\nYo, I flash on them then I go and smash\nCouple hoes and then splash on them\nFlicking a little ash on them\nFrom the blunt we smoking, keep a chick choking\nGot them open with flows\nI suppose it make them soak in their clothes\nKeep the shit that make 'em sniff and make em open they nose\nGot them fucked up, stuck just like they striking a pose\nYo, we gaining weight, nah, it's just my pockets are swole\nFrom keeping niggas whylin' while they driving smacking the pole\nAh, one, two, yeah, see, perhaps, while I hold me a stack\nHater niggas block, holding me back\nYo, you fool niggas plotting against the god best be holding a strap\n'Cause how we coming through, you know it's a wrap\nMove with a crew of guerrilla dudes who know when to clap\nI blow some shit from off of the Earth or the face of the map\nYo, so take that\nOnce we give it to you, ain't no faking a jack\nIt's funny how you find your face in a trap\nLittle bitch nigga fronting like he ready to scrap\nYou better off acting pussy trying to give me a dap\nStaying focused on fulfilling a dream\nThe way we spark up and spit a fire, the flame probably killing your team\nFuck it, so now we harbor helicopters, turn this shit up\nIf you and your peoples ain't hearing me proper\nI'm sayin...\n\n[Chorus: Busta Rhymes + (Redman)]\nSo you don't know nuthin' about it\n(Barking...Turn me up some)\nYo, the heat from of the street will burn you up some\nYo, the shit I'm sure to spit will hurt you up some\nI'm sayin'\nBut you don't know nuthin' about it\n(Barking...Turn me up some)\nYo, I drink a fifth of yack and hurl it up some\nYo, just bang it in the truck and turn it up some\nI'm sayin'...", "image":

gift-wrapped package for you motherfuckers\nYeah, yo, yo, yo, yeah\nBust it\n\n[Verse 1]\nI stay rippin' a nigga tracks so\nHotter than wax, yo, so tell me why you act so\nYo, I max 'cause I make a nigga black 'til its time to relax yo\nUntil you all collapse so, fuck it\nIt's hardly that the god is getting tired\nYou don't wanna say that\nCan catch a cardiac relapse, nigga\nWhat, the god is back so you don't want nuthin'\nNo matter how you react\nBlows that black and blue your front and your back\nChoose, whatever the route that you choose\nWounds so horrendous forensics will get to analyzing the bruise\nBlows will never come in singular, they coming in twos\nMy crew be starting the ruckus once I give them the cues\nTo blast from the triggers that'll bust from all of my dudes\nBe the shit that make you niggas run up out of your shoes\nWe make you back down, having the facts down\nWith all the noise you be making you can even see the shit on the news\nWord up\n\n[Chorus: Busta Rhymes + (Redman)]\nSo you don't know nuthin' about it\n(Barking...Turn me up some)\nYo, the heat from of the street will burn you up some\nYo, the shit I'm sure to spit will hurt you up some\nI'm sayin'\nBut you don't know nuthin' about it\n(Barking...Turn me up some)\nYo, I drink a fifth of yack and hurl it up some\nYo, just bang it in the truck and turn it up some\nI'm sayin'...\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow watch me get a nigga fast, like them bitches with no ass\nYou corny niggas low class\nYo, I flash on them then I go and smash\nCouple hoes and then splash on them\nFlicking a little ash on them\nFrom the blunt we smoking, keep a chick choking\nGot them open with flows\nI suppose it make them soak in their clothes\nKeep the shit that make 'em sniff and make em open they nose\nGot them fucked up, stuck just like they striking a pose\nYo, we gaining weight, nah, it's just my pockets are swole\nFrom keeping niggas whylin' while they driving smacking the pole\nAh, one, two, yeah, see, perhaps, while I hold me a stack\nHater niggas block, holding me back\nYo, you fool niggas plotting against the god best be holding a strap\n'Cause how we coming through, you know it's a wrap\nMove with a crew of guerrilla dudes who know when to clap\nI blow some shit from off of the Earth or the face of the map\nYo, so take that\nOnce we give it to you, ain't no faking a jack\nIt's funny how you find your face in a trap\nLittle bitch nigga fronting like he ready to scrap\nYou better off acting pussy trying to give me a dap\nStaying focused on fulfilling a dream\nThe way we spark up and spit a fire, the flame probably killing your team\nFuck it, so now we harbor helicopters, turn this shit up\nIf you and your peoples ain't hearing me proper\nI'm sayin...\n\n[Chorus: Busta Rhymes + (Redman)]\nSo you don't know nuthin' about it\n(Barking...Turn me up some)\nYo, the heat from of the street will burn you up some\nYo, the shit I'm sure to spit will hurt you up some\nI'm sayin'\nBut

the right things for\nBitch sexy, and beautiful, and gangsta, and golden\nLove to fuck a nigga till the pussy dry and swollen\nMy lil' bitch had a figure like a wine glass\nSlim bitch stackin like a muhfucker with a fine ass\nWord to mother; bitch nasty like me\nLove to fuck a nigga in places where people could see\nThe bitch send a chill like cold freezin a nigga\nThe way she holdin and bitin and suckin and squeezin a nigga\nDown and dirty bitch never dick teasin a nigga\nGot her own paper and focused on pleasin a nigga\nShe ain't out for gettin a nigga or fuckin my life\nShe only wanna fuck a nigga while he fuckin his wife\nThere was nuttin she couldn't achieve\nIn the mornin bitch was across the street waitin for wifey to leave\nCalled me on the cell while the wife was runnin a bath\nShe can't wait for me to fuck her, till I cum in her ass\nJust a long-time chick I used to fuck from the past\nShe love to out-fuck a nigga, see how long I could last\nIt be nice the way she always let me dig in her rib\nThe bitch fuck a nigga like she wanna move in my crib\nBitch I always knew ya ass was a star\nIn the daytime, whippin the droptop, givin me head in my car\n\n[Hook - Jaheim]\nWhen a woman needs love, just like you do\nOh, don't kid yourself, into thinkin that you don't\nCuz she will fool around, just like you do\nOhh, don't kid yourself, into thinkin that she won't\n\n[Busta Rhymes]\nC'mere bitch and place ya pussy right where it belong\nAnd put me in the mood to fuck just like a Jodeci song\nI love the little freaky shit you be approachin me on\nDick all in ya mouth, you know what type of shit I be on\nThe way the pussy lock feel like we about to be stuck\nAll outside busy, givin me the balcony fuck\nHold on get up off of me quick\nBitch grab the X.O. and suck the Hennessey up off of my dick\nSo quick, so fast, bitch'll come out her skirt\nFuck a nigga till it hurt, while the wifey at work\nThe bitch'll even call her girl so I can fuck with her friend\nAnd fall asleep to wake up and start fuckin again\nStraigh nasty little bitch no horsin around\nThe bitch even want me to fuck her when she walkin around\nHold up, it's kinda ill how we be workin the caper\nShe ain't only good for pussy, she be givin me paper\nWife-in-law, my bitch be always keepin it raw\nAlways slidin out before the wifey walk in the door\nThey way she fuck me on straight for the night\nWifey still ain't make it home, I wonder if she workin late for tonight\nWifey actin funny style but I ain't fuckin with that\nShe ain't call the crib so I wonder where wifey was at\nHmmm.. shit kinda had me buggin before\nBut now I laugh because wifey had a husband-in-law\n\n[Hook] 2x\n\nHeh... Heh..."}}, {"title": "Together", "album": "It Ain't Safe No More...", "year": "2002-11-26", "lyrics": "[Busta Rhymes]\nHey yo Swizz..\nThis shit sound like some shit\nThe streets wanna do the merengue to (yeah)\nOr dance around a sombrero too, WHOO!!!\nYeah, another special from Flipmode Records\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah here we go!\nStreets!

(WHOO!)\nYou see Flipmode is the team that I rep forever\nRespecting the Code of Honor staying together\nIt's getting hot I think you should take off the sweater\nRattle and knock all of your troops who goin to get this cheddar\nSee when we come I'm wondering how they gon' manage\nShow em mysteriously watch how they vanish\nSee when we finish just analyze all the damage\nNo matter who you are, we accept any and EVERY challenge (yeah)\nYeah yeah, I think we got 'em again this time\nFlipmode c'mon!\n\n[Hook - 1: Mynx] {*Busta Rhymes ad-libs*}\nI think I - I think wanna say something like this

flooding the streets\nWith heat for the ladies and niggas who be thugging\nAnd if you want it then bring shit wit open arms (spread love baby)\nWhile I continuously give you niggas bombs\nAssalam alaykom wa'alaykom salam\nI'm in the abscence of confusion holding the world in my palms\nI'm tired of telling you there ain't nothing greater\nSwinging the torch and repping for Violator\nSo tell the DJ to go and turn up the fader\nPutting it down for the streets regardless what you saying playa!\nHow many times am I gunna have to tell y'all?\nFlipmode run these streets, c'mon!\n\n[Hook - 2: Mynx]

"lyrics": "[Verse 1: Raekwon]\nOld dro bottles, and blow, blowin' from both zones\nLayin' in them Tahoes we own the projo's\nThree for tenement we in the lobby with the big\n(da dun dun dun) Don't move cause I'm a representative\nLive for the street, ask, you die in the war\n'member that -- blast that three atcha -- hide in the wall\nWe gangsta, republicans with them big things, big rings\nGet your head shot off, daddy you don't believe chains\nLoose cameras, big hammers, Station Wagon, blue Phantoms\nSmokin' the block up, y'all witness the zoo gamblers\nWe ain't takin' no shorts, its just the early 80's\nThat made me, now I sit paid and then maybe\nNothing but my Lords and raps, these bags of dope\nUnder the mattress and I clack like a slave key\nWash your squad up, I roll double refuse to rock\nClosed up my door up and murked you on the job (aww)\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes]\nGettin' money like back in the days\nNiggas like shower posse in a spectacular drug games\nSlayin' niggas, steady sprayin niggas, till the task forces'll roll up\nIn unmarked vehicles and will be layin' niggas\nStreched that coke and see it come back triple\nWhen we O.T. cut it with baking soda or quinine\nStrategize, gettin' paper like the Chinese, Jamaicans\nAnd George Chain niggas, and watch me set up a Goldmine\n\n[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]\nWe got guns tucked in our waistlines with rags hangin' from our back pockets\nMiraculous money, nigga, can't stop it\nSherlock Holme' Kangols\nMedallions so big, attach strings you could turn 'em into banjos\nPhenomenal profiting, drug money\nScram rapper, my 100EX golden like a honey graham cracker\nSidewinda, niggas tryna' infiltrate, blind-side a nigga\nHit you with the 8, we in the club\nDumbin' out, drunk in fronta the airbrush\nBackdrop, ones out, fi'-dollas for picture with the guns out\nJuggle for a couple days, close shop\nThen continue to bubble until the strip hotter than a microwave\nDon't stop, travel on my spare time\nAnd keep niggas wit us to push our shit like George Jefferson hairline\nNo frill, niggas better go chill\n'Fore this gun go up in your nose like coke sniffin' up your nose-stril\n\n[Hook]\nGettin' money like back in the days\nNiggas like shower posse in a spectacular drug games\nSlayin' niggas, steady sprayin niggas, till the task forces'll roll up\nIn unmarked vehicles and will be layin' niggas\nStreched that coke and see it come back triple\nWhen we O.T. cut it with baking soda or quinine\nStrategize, gettin' paper like the Chinese, Jamaicans\nAnd George Chain niggas, and watch me set up a Goldmine\n\n[Verse 3: Raekwon]\nAy yo, saluteme kid, coop me in the red room booth\nAnd eatin' Fruit Loops it's all for the loot boo\nDesignated hammer that'll lay ya up scrambling\nBlant ninjas get 'em more popped up, and start blowin' niggas magnums up\nCaught me in the mix wit some rich soldiers, that reaction\nIs a key action, black sent forty doja's up\nWe huddle in big plans, my big mans and them\nSlick as the shit breaks from outtas you, rip dip, then quakes them\n\n[Busta Rhymes]\nSee I was always good at science, in the class I was dope\nAsk 'em for the chemistry temperature now I'm cookin' the coke up\nUsed to sit and watch them older niggas for hours\nAnd did acknowledge to how cold water quickly harden the powder\nTook your turn into somethin big to acredit (uhh)\nBut ya needs connect shit up from South America\nMoney calculations, told B.I.G. I sit up on it still\nHoldin old hundred dollar bills, wit small faces\n\n[Hook]\nGettin' money like back in the days\nNiggas like shower posse in a spectacular drug games\nSlayin' niggas, steady sprayin niggas, till the task forces'll roll up\nIn unmarked vehicles and will be layin' niggas\nStreched that coke and see it come back triple\nWhen we O.T. cut it with baking soda or quinine\nStrategize, gettin' paper like the Chinese, Jamaicans\nAnd George Chain niggas, and watch me set up a Goldmine"}}], "artist": "Busta Rhymes"}
