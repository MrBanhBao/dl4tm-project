Where they at?\nWhere they at? Where they at?\nCome on, now\n\n[Chorus: Nelly]\nIf you want to go and take a ride with me\nWe 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's\nOh, why do I live this way?\n(Hey, must be the money!)\nIf you want to go and get high with me\nSmoke a L in the back of the Benz-E\nOh, why must I feel this way?\n(Hey, must be the money!)\n\n[Verse 1: Nelly]\nIn the club on the late night, feeling right\nLooking, trying to spot something real nice\nLooking for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home\n(I can take home) She can be\n18 (18) with an attitude\nOr 19, kinda snotty, acting real rude\nBut as long as you a thicky-thicky-thick girl you know that it's on\n(You know that it's on) I peep something\nComing towards me on the dance floor, sexy and real slow\nSaying she was peeping and I dig the last video\n\"So when Nelly, can we go?\" How could I tell her no?\nHer measurements was 36-25-34, tell it\nI like the way you brush your hair\nAnd I like those stylish clothes you wear\nI like the way the light hit the ice and glare\nAnd I can see you, boo, from way over there\n\n[Chorus: Nelly]\nIf you want to go and take a ride with me\nWe 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's\nOh, why do I live this way?\n(Hey, must be the money!)\nIf you want to go and get high with me\nSmoke a L in the back of the Benz-E\nOh, why must I feel this way?\n(Hey, must be the money!)\n\n[Verse 2: Nelly]\nFace and body Frontenac, don't know how to act\nWithout no vouchers on her boots she's bringing nothing back\nYou should feel the impact, shop on plastic\nWhen the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that\nWatch me as I gas that 4 dot 6 Range\nWatch the candy paint change, every time I switch lanes\nIt feel strange now, making a living off my brain\nInstead of 'caine now, I got the title from my\nMomma put the whip in my own name now, damn shit done\nChanged now, running credit checks with no shame now\nI feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)\nShit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town\nI'm getting pages out of New Jersey from Courtney B\nTelling me about a party up in NYC\nAnd can I make it? Damn right, I be on the next flight\nPaying cash; first class - sitting next to Vanna White, c'mon\n\n[Chorus: Nelly]\nIf you want to go and take a ride with me\nWe 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's\nOh, why do I live this way?\n(Hey, must be the money!)\nIf you want to go and get high with me\nSmoke a L in the back of the Benz-E\nOh, why must I feel this way?\n(Hey, must be the money!)\nIf you want to go and take a ride with me\nWe 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's\nOh, why do I live this way?\n(Hey, must be the money!)\nIf you want to go and get high with me\nSmoke a L in the back of the Benz-E\nOh, why must I feel this way?\n(Hey, must be the money!)\n\n[Bridge: Nelly]\nCheck, check, yo\nI know something you don't know\nAnd I've got something to tell ya\nYou won't believe how many people straight down at the Flo-\nMo said that I was a failure\nBut now the same motherfuckers asking me for dough\nAnd I'm yelling: \"I can't help ya\"\n\"But Nelly can we get tickets to the next show?\"\nHell no (what's witchyou?!) you for real?!\n\n[Verse 3: City Spud]\nHey yo, now that I'm a fly guy, and I fly high\nNiggas want to know why, why I fly by\nBut yo, it's all good, Range Rover all wood\nDo me like you should, fuck me good, suck me good\nWe be them stud niggas, \"wishing you was\" niggas\nPopping like we drug dealers, sipping Crissy, bubb' macking\nHoney in the club, me in the Benz\nIcy grip, telling me to leave with you and your friends\nSo if shorty wanna... knock, we knocking to this\nAnd if shorty wanna... rock, we rocking to this\nAnd if shorty wanna... pop, we popping the Crist'\nShorty wanna see the ice, then I ice the wrist\nCity talk, Nelly listen; Nelly talk, city listen\nWhen I fuck fly bitches; when I walk pay attention\nSee the ice and the glist'; niggas staring or they diss\nHonies looking all \"they wish,\" come on boo, gimme kiss, c'mon\n\n[Chorus: Nelly]\nIf you want to go and take a ride with me\nWe 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's\nOh, why do I live this way?\n(Hey, must be the money!)\nIf you want to go and get high with me\nSmoke a L in the back of the Benz-E\nOh, why must I feel this way?\n(Hey, must be the money!)\nIf you want to go and take a ride with me\nWe 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's\nOh, why do I live this way?\n(Hey, must be the money!)\nIf you want to go and get high with me\nSmoke a L in the back of the Benz-E\nOh, why must I feel this way?\n(Hey, must be the money!)\nHey, must be the money!\nHey, must be the money!\nHey, must be the money!\nMust be the money!\nIf you want to go and take a ride with me\nWe 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's\nOh, why do I live this way?\n(Hey, must be the money!)\nIf you want to go and get high with me\nSmoke a L in the back of the Benz-E\nOh, why must I feel this way?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1291df1aa36eade0d20f53e79a7e667a.366x327x1.jpg", "artist": "Nelly", "raw": {"annotation_count": 28, "api_path": "/songs/166", "apple_music_id": "557599", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/166/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "\u201cRide Wit Me\u201d is one of the earliest Nelly songs to get popular attention.

it's a shame that we\nGotta spend our time bein' mad about the same things\nOver and over again about the same thing\nOver and over again\nHo, but I think, she's leavin'\nAw, man, she's leavin'\nAnd,

McGraw]\nI remember the day you left\nI remember the last breath you took right in front of me\nWhen you said that you would leave\nI was too damn stubborn to try to stop you or say anything\nBut I see clearly now\nAnd this choice I made keeps playin' in my head\nOver and over again play in my head\nOver and over again\nHo, I think, she's leavin'\nAw, man, she's leavin'\nAnd, I don't know what

realized\nThat I'm goin' down\nFrom all this pain you've put me through\nEverytime I close my eyes (woo)\nI lock it down, ohh-hooo\nI can't go on not lovin' you\n\n[Hook: Tim McGraw & Nelly]\n'Cause

talkin bout; runnin your mouth, like you know me\nYou gon' fuck around and show why the \"Show Me\" get called the \"Show Me\"\nWhy one-on-one you can't hold me if your last name was Hanes\nOnly way you wear me out is stitch my name on your pants\nNo resident of France; but you swear I'm from Paris\nHundred-six karats - total? Naw that's per wrist\nTrying to compurr this - my chain to yo' chain\nI'm like Sprint or Motorola - no service, out of your range\nYou out of your brains, thinkin I'mma shout out your name\nYou gotta come up with better ways than that to catch your fame\nAll that pressure you applyin it's time to ease off\nBefore I hit you from the blindside takin your sleeves off\nAs much as we's floss, still hard to please boss\nDon't be lyin bitchin and cryin - suck it up as a loss\nCause your, acts is wack, your whole label is wack\nAnd matter fact, eh eh-eh eh a-hold that\n\n[Hook]\nI.. am..  #1 - no matter if you like it\nHere take it sit down & write it\nI.. am.. number one\nHey hey hey hey hey hey - now let me ask you man\nWhat does it take to be #1?\n2 is not a winner and three nobody remembers (hey)\nWhat does it take to be #1?\nHey hey hey hey..\n\nDo you like it when I shake it for ya, daddy? Move it all around?\nLet you get a peep before it touches the ground?\n\nHell yeah ma I love a girl that's willin to learn\nWillin to get in the driver's seat and willin to turn\nAnd not concerned about that he say, she say, did he say\nWhat I think he said? Squash that, he probably got that off eBay\nOr some, Internet access some, website chat line\nMad cause I got mine, don't wind up on the flat line\nOhh if my uncle could see me now\nIf he could see how many rappers wanna be me now\nStraight emulatin my style right to the \"down down\"\nCan't leave out the store now better wait 'til they calm down\nI got hella shorties, comin askin, \"Yo where the party?\"\nOhh lordy - will I continue to act naughty?\nMixing Cris' and Bacardi, got me thinkin fo' sho'\nI'm not a man of many words but there's one thing I know - Pimp\n\n[Hook]\nI.. am.. number one - no matter if you like it\nHere take it sit down and write it\nHey I.. am.. number one\nHey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey\nTell me now Dirty\nWhat does it take to be number one?\nTwo is not a winner and three nobody remembers (tell me)\nWhat does it take to be number one?\nHey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey\n\nCheck it, uhh, check, yo\nAiyyo I'm tired of people judgin what's real Hip-Hop\nHalf the time you be them niggas who fuckin album flop\nYOU KNOW!

Sweat dripping all over her body\nDo you like that sweat dripping all over my body?\n(Oh! Oh! Yeah I like that) Sweat dripping all over yo body\nYou like that sweat dripping all over my body\n\n[Verse 1: Nelly]\nIt's summertime and I'm back again\nThen went to VA yo and got my friends\nSay wassup, Pharrell! (These motherfuckers, now)\nYeah! But let's show em what's above an L, BLING!\n100 thou' couldn't get ya one of these\nI guarantee there ain't a flaw in one of these\n200 thou' couldn't get you in the league\nAnd 300 thou' you couldn't even buy the keys\nI think ya need to add 50 more G's\nNow shall I proceed?! (yes indeed!)\nHo! I need to see ya take it down to the floor\nSpread your wings if you're real ma, fly real low\nPause for a second ma, grind real slow\nAnd if you do it right Rodeo we'll go\nHo! I talk a lil Fred Siegel girl\nBonnie and Judy Lee but when she bad call Vida Guerra\nApple bottom wit a pearl underneath it\nYou talking like you don't need it, I can tell ya conceded\nI like that in you, I don't see nothing wrong\nDrop down and get your eagle on, whoa!\n\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Bridge: Pharrell & Vanessa Marquez & (Nelly)]\n(She's got that!)

My boo'll go and work the avenue\nMy boo'll fuck you up if I ask her to\nThat's why I do the things I do\nAnd I will always be there to give you whatever you want\n\n[Chorus]\n(Don't stop ever lovin' me)\nUh, uh, I said whatever you need\n(Don't stop ever lovin' me)\nUh, uh, I said I don't wanna lose you, no\n(Don't stop ever lovin' me)\nUh, uh, uh, 'cause you're my boo and my only one\n(Don't stop ever lovin' me)\nUh, uh, uh\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm doin' this one here for Shaun Haynes, Lashando and J.D\nD Quick, Boo Gees and Fatty\nMy nigga Lil' Erv, Gino and Poochie\nAnd everybody over on Euclid and Labade\nYoung Big Touch, Pooh and Big Baby\nRio, J.T. and Big Money\nHerky Jerk, Wezz and Pea and Cody\nJ.E., K-Ug and Odie\nToe-Fa, M.J., and Colby\nAnd all my soldiers down at Fair Ground on Monday\nMy Lunatic fam, Kyjuan, Murphy Lee\nCity Spud, T-Love and Big 'Li\nYellow Mack, Slow Down, Courtney B\nThe rest of my niggas up in the N.Y.C\nAnd without Trail, Cooter and Coach it just wouldn't be\nAnd I will always be there to give you whatever you want\n\n[Chorus]\n(Don't stop ever lovin' me)\nUh, uh, I said whatever you need\n(Don't stop ever lovin' me)\nUh, uh, 'cause y'all my niggas for life you know\n(Don't stop ever lovin' me)\nUh, uh, uh, you can always smoke with me\n(Don't stop ever lovin' me)\nUh, uh, uh, uh"}}, {"title": "Batter Up", "album": "Country Grammar",

the singing of our national anthem\n\n[Chorus: Nelly]\nMmm, I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen\nBeans don't burn on the grill (that's right)\nIt took a whole lot of trying\nJust to get up that hill\nI said but now we're up in the big leagues\nMy dirty it's our turn at bat\nAnd just as long as we livin', it's Lunatics playa\nIt ain't nothin' wrong with that, huh, batter up\n\n[Verse 1: Ali]\nI'm the first to swing\nHome run with that give-me-what-you-got thing, hot wings\nFuck a dub, smoke an ounce, show me love\nHit the club, me and T-Luv holla what\nI put my mack down, she throw a curve ball\nShe owed Milli smoked that herb and some Llly-bone\nShe tip-top 'em, Optimo\nFirst base, god livin; like a worst race\nFirst chase, throw yo' people and yo' kind\nSecond lesson, smoke that herb and clear yo' mind\nIt's about time, second base wisdom rhyme\nSittin' strong, skipped third base and headed home\nThird baseman just don't understand, baby, what the bong\nWhat the fuck wrong, with this world today?\nWith these girls today, diamonds and pearls the way\nYou wasn't fuckin' with me, leave, for the wrap that's in my seed\nNow you stays on yo knees cause we's be in the big league\n'Cause we's be in the big league\n\n[Chorus: Nelly]\nMmm, I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen\nBeans don't burn on the grill (that's right)\nIt took a whole lot of trying\nJust to get up

Nelly]\nWell you should see me now, I'm eatin' Wheaties now\nI'm stealin' second and third, lookin' home, gettin' greedy now\nSee me now, people call me speedy now\nKnown for runnin' the quickest miles\nHit and run in any town, any ground\nRules 'fore I hit it, split it, lick it and quit it\nAnd hit it, lick it, did I say lick it, (yeah) fuck it, lick it\nAin't no shame in my game, that normal shit ain't my thang\nIf I think with my dick then put your mouth on my brain\nI maintain through the atmosphere, what we got here\nA sucker in fear, hear the roars and the cheers\nFrom the crowd when I take the mile, let me show 'em how\nHit the ball on the ground and make 'em get down\n\n[Chorus: Nelly]\nMmm, I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen\nBeans don't burn on the grill (that's

U-City of St. Louis, Missouri\n(I think his name's umm, who knows\nMur-uhh, Murphey Lee or somethin)\n\n[Verse 3: Murphey Lee]\nI want my name not, not said but screamed\nI went from fantasies to dreams, dreams to bigger things\nI'm like Bennett I been in it since, ninety-three\nYou can tell cause my L angle 90 degrees\nI'm a sixteen-year-old school boy, platinum skills\nSwear to tell the real, the whole real to make a mill'\nI lie little but still, talk straight up like motto\nI could tell you somethin' now, you think twice about it tomorrow\nI promise, I gets deeper than file cabinets when rappin'\nMoney, money, money, money what's happenin'\nI'm comin' up like family members in basements, and I stay bent\nMake a milli to play with, buy a building you can pay me\nAnd the 'tic is who I came with, you know how we do\nWe do, we do, we do, we do, we do\n\n[Chorus: Nelly]\nMmm, I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen\nBeans don't burn on the grill (that's right)\nIt took a whole lot of trying\nJust to get up that hill\nI said but now we're up in the big leagues\nMy dirty it's our turn at bat\nAnd just as long as we livin', it's Lunatics playa\nIt ain't nothin' wrong

drawers\nAnd you still gon' find the same old\nCountry Azz Nigga\nCountry Azz Nigga\n\nWay before the house\nWay before the cars\nI was pullin' broads\nAnd I still was gettin' called old\nCountry Azz Nigga\nCountry Azz Nigga\n\n[Verse 1: Nelly]\nCall me Mr. All That\nAll that\nE'rything you have, I'm all that\nCall me wack\nYou better call back\n(Crawl back)\nOr fall back before that black mack, bust all that\nOld schoolin' that new thing\nWhite V-neck with two chains\nLike 2 Chainz, I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it\nThis is mine, I'mma spend it\nIf she's fine, I'll hit it right mayne\nYou hear that beat, that's Drumma Boy\nWhen I see you, that's trouble, boy\nSay the word and I'm in thurr\nName the time, and that when/where\nI'ma two piece ya like swimwear\n\nTake away the money\nTake away the fame\nStrip me to my drawers\nAnd you still gon' find the same old\nCountry Azz Nigga\nCountry Azz Nigga\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: T.I.]\nRubber bands on my cheddar knots\nCause I'm super cool and I'm hella hot\nA broad, a menage, I'mma let her eye\nWhile I'm barrelin' out, and I'm yelling out\nFuck you, bitch, I'm so stupid\nI love no ho, ain't no Cupid\nKing of the south, thought you knew this\nI screw her mouth then throw deuces\nI'm wit' Nelly and 2 Chainz, and 2 Chainz give two shits\nI'm A-Town, I'm West Side, Bankhead, Shawty I'm foolish\nOld school car, new chick, don't lose your ho when I ride, fool\nThese millions don't mean shit, I was the man when I was in high school\nAll about survival where I come from\nYoung and dumb, Bible all a nigga run from\nIgnorant\nBelligerent\nCan't wait to get a quarter key and get to gettin' it\n\n[Hook: Nelly]\nTake away the money\nTake away the fame\nStrip me to my drawers\nAnd you still gon' find the same old\nCountry Azz Nigga\nCountry Azz Nigga\n\nWay before the house\nWay before the cars\nI was pullin' broads\nAnd I still was gettin' called old\nCountry Azz Nigga\nCountry Azz Nigga\n\n[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]\nI'm a country nigga, and I keep it street\nAll I smoke is strong\nStraight section eight\nI got socks on with my house shoes\nI got my baby mama name tattooed\nI got another bitch with another bitch\nMad cause I fucked up her hairdo (damn)\nHair weave killa\nOn a \"wanted\" poster\nDance on a white girl\nCall it John Travolta\nI'm a country nigga, I fuck her on the sofa\nMy whip white with the black top like Sammy Sosa\nIf you ain't got no money\nYou better have hustle\nSee when I got some money\nAll I did was add muscle\nTity 2 Chainz, and the two's never too much\nExtension cord is when you put together 2 blunts\n\n[Hook: Nelly]\nTake away the money\nTake away the fame\nStrip me to my drawers\nAnd you still gon' find the same old\nCountry Azz Nigga\nCountry Azz Nigga\n\nWay before the house\nWay before the cars\nI was pullin' broads\nAnd I still was gettin' called old\nCountry Azz Nigga\nCountry Azz Nigga"}}, {"title": "Freaky With You", "album": null,

know I know who you are\"\nSoon as you pulled up, I peeped you\nLace dress, all see through\nGet to talkin' 'bout her boyfriend\nAin't tryna hear 'bout other people\nThink she said he was a ball player\nBut all his plays under review\nForeplay, that's a preview\nRound two, that's the sequel\nBaby, I can keep a secret\nHe ain't gotta know what we do\nWe low as the ground\nCall me when he ain't

baby\nMake you real hot\nLet me do all the things that a nigga wan' do\nTell me why\n'Cause tonight, baby, I wanna get freaky with you\n\n[Verse 1: Nelly]\nUh, yeah\nPretty lady, nice to meet you\nMy name is Nelly and you're?\nShe said, \"Baby, you don't need to\nYou know I know who you are\"\nSoon as you pulled up, I peeped you\nLace dress, all see through\nGet to talkin' 'bout her boyfriend\nAin't tryna hear 'bout other people\nThink she said he was a ball player\nBut all his plays under review\nForeplay, that's a preview\nRound two, that's the sequel\nBaby, I can keep a secret\nHe ain't gotta know what we do\nWe low as the ground\nCall me when he ain't around\n\n[Chorus: Jacquees]\nLet me lick you up and down\n'Til you say stop, stop (woo)\nLet me play with your body, baby\nMake you real hot (you hot, woo)\nLet me do all the things that a nigga wan' do\nTell me why\n'Cause tonight, baby, I wanna get freaky with you\n\n[Verse 2: Nelly]\nUh, uh, yeah\nQuit tryna hide all that freakin', yeah\nI'm fantasizin' 'bout freakin' you\nI'ma need 'bout a week or two\nPretty pussy playin' peekaboo\nGot some ideas on what we can do\nI'm talkin' 'bout the unspeakable\nYou're sendin' your silhouette\nIt's amazin' we ain't on a pillow yet\n'Cause the way that you got me hypnotized\nYou came with your girls and I'm with the guys\nGirl, call the valet, they go get the ride\nThen it's straight to my place for a different vibe\nI swear I ain't never seen thicker thighs\nGot plans, unless you wanna improvise\nRight now, don't make a sound\nYou know who wearin' the crown\n\n[Chorus: Jacquees]\nLet me lick you up and down\n'Til you say stop (no, I never gon' stop, never gon' stop)\nLet me play with your body, baby\nMake you real hot (make you hot, make you hot, make you hot)\nLet me do all the things that a nigga wan' do (that a nigga wan' do)\nTell me why\n'Cause tonight, baby, I wanna get freaky with you\n\n[Bridge: Jacquees]\nYou, I know I know what you like\nYou, shawty, you ain't gotta hide it\nPull that to the side, and let me get inside\n\n[Chorus: Jacquees]\nLet me lick you up and down\n'Til you say stop (no, I never gon' stop, never gon' stop)\nLet me play with your body, baby\nMake you real hot (make you hot, make you hot, make you hot)\nLet me do all the things that a nigga wan' do\nTell me why\n'Cause tonight, baby, I

feel safe now I\u2019m danger\nSo when you had to leave without a warning\nSuch a whirlwind, I want my girlfriend\nGot me on ten, I can\u2019t even pretend\nYou used to love me, but now you ain't here\n\n[Hook: Florida Georgia Line]\nAnd I hope you\u2019re happy\nHope you got what you wanted\nAnd since I no longer want it\nI guess, I walk away\n(Guess I got you to walk away, yeah)\nI really hope he makes you happy\nI hope he gives you everything that you wanting\nAll the things that you wanting\nBut the presence I\u2019m holding\nI guess I walk away\n(Guess I got you to walk away)\n\n[Verse 2: Nelly]\nGirl you got me all this stressing and this manic depressing\nI\u2019m switching up how I'm feeling and listening to suggestions\nHey your expression is new, thought you knows all up in her IQ\nAnd I could write a book on how to\nRuin a good thing, living without you\nThought I paid for my wrongs \u2018cause I ain\u2019t have enough\nTold me I\u2019m living, I had to call you bluff\nNow I\u2019m calling your phone, but you ain\u2019t picking up\nI should have gave you love, I should have gave you trust\nAnd now you moved on, and you\u2019re forgetting us\nI\u2019m singing this sad song, but you don\u2019t give a fuck\n\n[Hook:]\n\n[Verse 3: Florida Georgia Line]\nThere\u2019s nothing that hurts more than heartbreak\nNo one wants to take that fault\nYou\u2019re

now I\u2019m danger\nSo when you had to leave without a warning\nSuch a whirlwind, I want my girlfriend\nGot me on ten, I can\u2019t even pretend\nYou used to love me, but now you ain't here\n\n[Hook: Florida Georgia Line]\nAnd I hope you\u2019re happy\nHope you got what you wanted\nAnd since I no longer want it\nI guess, I walk away\n(Guess I got you to walk away, yeah)\nI really hope he makes you happy\nI hope he gives you everything that you wanting\nAll the things that you wanting\nBut the presence I\u2019m holding\nI guess I walk away\n(Guess I got you to walk away)\n\n[Verse 2: Nelly]\nGirl you got me all this stressing and this manic depressing\nI\u2019m switching up how I'm feeling and listening to suggestions\nHey your expression is new, thought you knows all up in her IQ\nAnd I could write a book on how to\nRuin a good thing, living without you\nThought I paid for my wrongs \u2018cause I ain\u2019t have enough\nTold me I\u2019m living, I had to call you bluff\nNow I\u2019m calling your phone, but you ain\u2019t picking up\nI should have gave you love, I should have gave you trust\nAnd now you moved on, and you\u2019re forgetting us\nI\u2019m singing this sad song, but you don\u2019t give a fuck\n\n[Hook:]\n\n[Verse 3: Florida Georgia Line]\nThere\u2019s nothing that hurts more than heartbreak\nNo one wants to take that fault\nYou\u2019re thinking about her all day\nNothing else matters at all\nAnd the only thing worse than her living\nIs knowing it\u2019s your fault\nAnd now I\u2019m going through hard times\n\n[Hook:]"}}, {"title": "Gone", "album":

Sounds, knockin' out of control\nLike a boom boom boom, who is it? It's Jackie Frost\nThe one who's gettin' where he at and he showed you who was the boss\nI'm like a human hot sauce\nThinkin I'll burn your thoughts\nYour information was false\nI'll show you just

AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Nelly]\nIt's like a big time decision made on how I can twurk it\nIf hard work pays off then easy work is worthless\nMy work habit ain't no habit man, I do it on purpose\nI push myself to the limit so my talent'll surface\nSo now it's, curtains and drapes, on anybody who hates\nDislikin what I'm recitin, bitin what I've been writin\nI've been dogfightin, scratchin and clawin on every hike\nTryin to make you remember me like you Remember the Titans\nCause I'm a WARR-IOR, my daddy was a soldier\nA Vietnam vet, lil' derrty I thought I told ya\nI'm supposed ta, whip up your town in Testarossas\nHeatin like Folgers mayne, I'm young, black, and rich\nAs good as it gets, and givin your point guard fits\nHe think he done seen pressure mayne, but he ain't seen shhhh...\nAIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW, AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW\nAIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW, AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW\n\n[Hook] - repeat 2X", "image":

thicky thick\nLookin' like a lolli-pop waitin' for the lick, girl\nYou're thicky thicky thicky thick\nRemind me of my 6-4 waitin' at the switch, girl\nYou're thicky thicky thicky thick\nCould be a crime that I'm waiting to commit, girl?\nYou're thicky thicky thicky thick\n\n[Verse 1: Murphy Lee]\nSo basically I'm a joke right?\nLook me in the eyes and tell me if you don't lie\nWhen I use that, shoes untied before you know it, method:\nFirst step we getting naked, pants gone in 20 seconds\nIt's gettin' hectic, wreck it just like a hooptie with insurance\nBut it seems I'm behind schedule with broad troubles twistin' and pullin'\nI'm like shorty help me (come on)\nHelp me (please) don't blow my high, cause I'm too horny\nShe giggles and gives a horny smile...\nSo I take advantage\nKisses in gentle places tryin' to get myself established\nI'm comfortable, wanna be in that moe with no control\nConcentrating on my every lick her every blow\nYep, I'm still blowed, but cooler than two below\nAnd how I got that rubber on, her ass'll never know\nIT'S ON, put my penis in accurate, just relax a bit\nNow it's my time to party like the lunatics at an after-set\n\n[Chorus: Nelly]\nSee now you could be a lady or a bitch, girl\nStill, you're thicky thicky thicky thick\nLookin' like a lolli-pop waitin' for the lick, girl\nYou're thicky thicky thicky thick\nRemind me of my 6-4 waitin' at the switch, girl\nYou're thicky thicky thicky thick\nCould be a crime that I'm waiting to commit, girl?\nYou're thicky thicky thicky thick\n\n[Verse 2: Ali]\nNow I comes first like the front porch, in a Polo Sport shirt\nSkirts, there they are, gots to flirt cause I'm far\nFrom Average Lame with that \"What's your name?\" game\nI'm stormin' on your brain like a surgeon in the rain\nTake the fame if you can, watch me wrap like Saran\nAll up in these sheets, now you on me like a tan\nLeavin me like a van in reverse, that's the worse\nPlaya curse put up on me now, we spreadin' on my homies\nLike a germ, watch me turn into captain kill a ho\nFill a ho strong watch me last long like a penny broke\nMany motels I got a rich coupon\nI'm doing dismounts on futons, comin' out like Keyuan\nI'm ill like ceramic in a hammock, goddamit\nThat's my words, ooh's and aah's slurred like a verb\nShowin' action like an ass like a metaphor\nNow I'm headed for the highways selling me by's sideways\n\n[Chorus: Nelly]\nSee now you could be a lady or a bitch, girl\nStill, you're thicky thicky thicky thick\nLookin' like a lolli-pop waitin' for the lick, girl\nYou're thicky thicky thicky thick\nRemind me of my 6-4 waitin' at the switch, girl\nYou're thicky thicky thicky thick\nCould be a crime that I'm waiting to commit, girl?\nYou're thicky thicky thicky thick\n\n[Verse 3: Nelly]\nI spit mo' shit off into they ears than dialtones and telephones\nJust to get their ass back home\nCome watch the Bed-rock like Flintstones\nBut son too strong, so I smoke a sack as fat as Santa (y'know)\nDrive me nuts like Planters, hawkin' a nigga like offalana (swish)\nI ban ya from the smoke house, trick, who you think you fuckin with?\nTrying to play me like Jim Carrey and pull some dumber and dumber shit\nStomp me like a step show (grab hold) then I let go\n(Flows) split that ass like g-strings up on these rat hoes\nI pose as a threat, to hit any one of you niggas rattin'\nSpit some game and get a bird, come watch us tag team like free bird\nSay the word, I be at rest with all my partners\nStraight loungin' with a pocket full of rubbers and have it bouncin'\nGo make the announcement, spark more Dynamite than \"Good Times\"\nWant both girls like prime time, want real highs and thick thighs\nTake pride in my stabbin', headboards you be grabbin'\nGot 'em bangin' the walls so hard the neighbors callin'\n\n[Chorus: Nelly]\nAsking you, \"What happened? What's goin' on over there even?\nSounds like you guys are goin' crazy\"\nSee now you could be a lady or a bitch, girl\nStill, you're thicky thicky thicky thick\nLookin' like a lolli-pop waitin' for the lick, girl\nYou're thicky thicky thicky thick\nRemind me of my 6-4 waitin' at the switch, girl\nYou're thicky thicky thicky thick\nCould be a crime that I'm waiting to commit, girl?\nYou're thicky thicky thicky thick\nSee now you could be a lady or a bitch, girl\nStill, you're thicky thicky thicky thick\nLookin' like a lolli-pop waitin' for the lick, girl\nYou're thicky thicky thicky thick\nRemind me of my 6-4 waitin' at the switch, girl\nYou're thicky thicky thicky thick\nCould be a crime that I'm waiting to commit, girl?\nYou're thicky thicky thicky thick\nSee now you could be a lady or a bitch, girl\nStill, you're thicky thicky thicky thick\nLookin' like a lolli-pop waitin' for the lick, girl\nYou're thicky thicky thicky thick\nRemind me of my 6-4 waitin' at the switch, girl\nYou're thicky thicky thicky thick"}}, {"title": "Stepped On My J'z", "album": "Brass Knuckles", "year": "2008-07-01", "lyrics": "[Intro: Jermaine Dupri]\nUhh...

The cake will do\nUhh, uhh uhh, the cake will do\nTell 'em, fuck the shame, tell 'em\nFuck the game, don't let the game fuck you\nCheck it out\n\n[Verse 1]\nI opened up shop at 13\nDimes, dubs, quarter sacks and O-Z's\nFrom hand-held, digital to triple-beam\nNow my pa-ger's an e-mail flip screen\nExpanded my game off into amphetamines\nLooked around and had a small Walgreens\nPut the word out on the street don\u2019t you fuck with my fiends\nThem niggas around the corner then let the thing beam\nNow they done let it burn out, phone a ching ching\nJust another hustle to add to my schemes\nJust another piece of the puzzle to my dreams\n'Cause the house, the cars, and the coffee take cream\nI might ride the Range with the Rollie on the rocks\nOr push a candy-colored Cutlass with a matching G Shock\nWhen the spot get hot don't stop, move shop\nFind another block restock and take it from the top now\n\n[Chorus]\nGreed, hate, envy, what cake will do\nFuck the game don't let the game fuck you\nFollow the rules stay cool and rock jewels\nGreed, hate, envy, what cake will do\nGreed, hate, envy, what cake will do\nFuck the game don't let the game fuck you\nFollow the rules stay cool and rock jewels\nGreed, hate, envy, what cake will do\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo you think you're the shit nigga Ya smell me\nShouts out to my nigga Nore\nI'll never take another man's glory\nShit don't mix like Shaq and Kobe\nNow you know me, I be low key\nOn these icey Rollie, dudes done showed me\nAnd hoes ignored me, now they blow me\nThem niggas that loaned me, now they owe me\nOh me, oh my, I can see tha greed and tha envy in yo eyes\nNow call me a lie\nWhile you five stand by I stand by the captain\nHo play now did somebody page Samson\nI stay cheefin' higher than a hooker on the weekends\nSeven days, a weekend man, I walk in yo church reekin\nAunt Esther called me, \u201cA heathen, old fish-eyed fool\u201d\nBitch had the nerve to repeat it, \u201cOld fish-eyed fool\u201d c'mon\n\n[Chorus]\nGreed, hate, envy, what cake will do\nFuck the game don't let the game fuck you\nFollow the rules stay cool and rock jewels\nGreed, hate, envy, what cake will do\nGreed, hate, envy, what cake will do\nFuck the game don't let the game fuck you\nFollow the rules stay cool and rock jewels\nGreed, hate, envy, what cake will do\n\n[Verse 3]\nOne time out in the Range Rover\n(Woop, woop, woop) Aww shit they pulled me over\nWhat the hell y'all fuckin' wit' me fo'?\nSpeed limit 30 just doin' 34\n\"Yeah son, where the gun?\" It's at home wit the dope\n\"Oh you a smart ass, hah?\" Nah, that's my lil joke\n\"How 'bout I tow yo' truck in?\" Ain't no need to be provoked\nBesides everything up in here done been smoked\nI ain't got nothin' but tapes and CDs\nPocket full of G's and two tickets across seas\nSo me and my boo can lay under the palm trees\nAin't no more questions then hand me my ID\nYou could tell he was pissed\n'Cause the black man in the Black Range\nDoin' black things with his black change\nDoin' the right thing, drivin' his ass insane\nAnd if I wasn't in his face he probably be callin' me names\n\n[Chorus]\nGreed, hate, envy, what cake will do\nFuck the game don't let the game fuck you\nFollow the rules stay cool and rock jewels\nGreed, hate, envy, what cake will do\nGreed, hate, envy, what cake will do\nFuck the game don't let the game fuck you\nFollow the rules stay cool and rock jewels\nGreed, hate, envy, what cake will do\nGreed, hate, envy, what cake will do\nFuck the game don't let the game fuck you\nFollow the rules stay cool and rock jewels\nGreed, hate, envy, what cake will do\nGreed, hate, envy, what cake will do\nFuck the game don't let the game fuck you\nFollow the rules stay cool and rock jewels\nGreed, hate, envy, what

out that joint\nMan\n\n[Intro]\nIf I could, fly away\nOoo and I wouldn't come back no more\nI, I'd turn around\nJust to see you for the last time\nSee, now I know\nHey, that it won't be easy\nI done fought in a battle, and I done made it this far\nI gotta few more feet, but its still the longest yard\n\n[Verse 1: Nelly]\nMan, it's the longest yard I ever had to get in my life\nAnd see my life ain't right, if my wife don't write\nMy niggas can't eat if the fish don't bite\nMy raise the gross sales, like Mike and Ike\nNow big brother almighty\nI keep a gamma ray, I'mma G-5 G\nTake a G-5 jeep, G-5 deep\nToo some of their bare feet\nAnd that jeep don't speak\nListen mayne they lock it down round herre\nSee body bag and gag and your found round herre\nThis as serious as it sound round herre\nThe guards guard the ground, 4 pounds round herre\nAnd they ain't playin, they're just lettin you know\nThat anything they want to happen, make it happen real slow\nGet the word from upstairs, put you in that hole\nI can't take it, I'm just ready to go\n\n[Hook]\nIf I could, fly away\nOoo and I wouldn't come back no more\nI, I'd turn around\nJust to see you for the last time\nSee, now I know\nHey, that it won't be easy\nI done fought in a battle, and I done made it this far\nI gotta few more feet, but its still the longest yard\nYeah yeah, it's still the longest yard\nUh uh, it's still the longest yard\nUm um, it's still the longest yard\nI done fought in a battle and I done made it this far (this far)\n\n[Verse 2: Nelly]\nI'm in my cell 20 hours a day\nAnd doin push-ups ever hour a day\nCause im tryin to keep the cowards away\nThats why im markin off the calendar days\nTryin to get it out of the way\nAnd im just tryin to keep a peace of mind\nAnd im gonna shank a motherfucker with a piece of mine\nCause he tryin to take a piece of mine\nSo im gon slice his ass a piece at a time\nBut now that they close the door\nLock me in and cell 30 deep but its built for 10\nTell me what kind of world they got you in\nWhen the barbed wire fences box you in\nFrom now, til they turn off the lights\nI'mma read everything in sight\nIts kinda hard tryin to read at night\nBut I'mma change my life\nAnd help another brother take this flight\n\n[Hook]\nIf I could, fly away\nOoo and I wouldn't come back no more\nI, I'd turn around\nJust to see you for the last time\nSee, now I know\nHey, that it won't be easy\nI done fought in a battle, and I done made it this far\nI gotta few more feet, but its still the longest yard\nYeah yeah, it's still the longest yard\nUh uh, it's still the longest yard\nUm um, it's still the longest yard\nI done fought in a battle and I done made it this far (this far)\n\n[Verse 3: Nelly]\n(Oohh no) I gotta make it out this place some how\n(Oohh no) Man I really believe that I done turned it around\n(Oohh no) You see, all I need is that second chance to show\nSince incarceration, my obligation of rehabilitation\n(Oohh no) They can punch me high, and they can kick me low\n(Oohh no) Spit on me its gonna take more than that for them to break my soul, I said\n(Oohh no) Man its hard for people to understand what its like to be\nGated, incarcerated, I just can't take it\nBut I'mma make it man to see better days\n\n[Hook]\nIf I could, fly away\nOoo and I wouldn't come back no more\nI, I'd turn around\nJust to see you for the last time\nSee, now I know\nHey, that it won't be easy\nI done fought in a battle, and I done made it this far\nI gotta few more feet, but its still the longest yard\nYeah yeah, it's still the longest yard\nUh uh, it's still the longest yard\nUm um, it's still the longest yard\nI done fought in a battle and I done made it this far (this far)\n\n[Hook]\nIf I could fly away\nIf I could I

pow)\nMy 45 her 9's out like (pow pow)\nThen stop, like timeout\nNo disrespect to your broad I know she might be your hard\nBut mine is more like my brain, without her man I'm insane\nGot down bitch and a round ass\nShotgun in the ghost while I'm whipping up the coast\nPassin [?] while I'm whipping up the dope\nIf she run for president I be the first nigga to vote\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Fabolous]\nI'm talking watch up grades, she get better with time\nI write a song about her, probably better my rhymes\nThrow down in the kitchen, might need better then moms\nWake me up with some head, ain't no better alarm\nMove in by myself, a force when we together\nI was sick of these niggas, of course she made me better\nI put her in her position others never could be in\nCouple racks for her shoes but she never been skiing\nKind you never be seeing, everything European\nShe look black, white, Spanish, and mixed with Korean\nI say she the baddest, cause I don't know no better\nI say she the baddest, and I don't know no better\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]\nUh, pulled up smellin' just like Marley\nSpent all that bread on Givenchy\nYour bitches more less be basic\nMy bitch fly private rock fly shit\nThat 911 she driving in it\nOff shore she diving in it\nRolex match Rolex I hit the jeweler go buy some minutes\nLift weights I pound up in it\nHit the walls I climb up in it\nApplause need a round up in it\nEver lost I get found up in it\nI'm a boss and my lady floss when I take her down in rodeo\nYou would think they was on pay roll\nThey don't close the store till I say so\nAnd the car I'm riding is payed for\nShe know I'm high when I'm going places you know I'm fly\nWhen you step outside niggas know you fine but they know you mine\n\n[Hook]", "image":

They ain't sure\nAutomatically I place the blame on my health\nHell, I'm her father mayne, I place the blame on myself\nWas it somethin that I smoked, did I eat or did I drink it?\nOr was it somethin I was doin that I did or did I think it?\nHuh, watchin her breathe through her holes in her nose\nWhat's this EKG machine? What's this shit on her toes?\nIt's 94, I'm 85, so I'm spooked as can be (c'mon!)\nI'm prayin and I'm askin, \"Why He do this to me?\"\nSee, I used to hold you in the palm of my hand\nAnd just to see you pull through - shit I knew you'd pull through\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Nelly]\nMarch 2-2nd, 1999\nThe year and the date I got my lil' man\nI guess I felt how my father felt and his father felt\nAnd his father musta felt to see hisself\nIt's like a lil' me in the flesh\nHe got my blood and my heart in his chest\nNeedless to say, man I love him to death\nTeach him if he disrespect me I'mma love him to death\nLeft to go out of town right after he was born\nI got a record deal, three months later Daddy was gone\nIt's like I'm tryin to raise him over the phone\nHe barely know my face when he see it but he know my tone\nI'm hopin, I'm like - \"Do he know who his Daddy is?\"\nI'm real close to sayin fuck the showbiz\nBut when I hurr him call his Daddy now\nAnd when I hurr him tell his friends, \"I'ma be just like my Daddy now\"\nHope he forgive me for the sacrifice\nSo he can have a better life - than I had\n\n[Hook 2x]", "image":

(Yea.. yeah!)\nYou sure? (Daddy!)\nI don't think today your birthday (Then what you call me for?)\nOh, I don't know, I just called to see what you was doin\nYou sure.. what, what, what you turn today?\nWhat you turn today, 19? (No, I'm turnin 10, Daddy)\nNah you turnin, what 32, 32, you 32 today (You have been away for a long time)\nIt feel like it, don't it? (Yeah)\nYeah, but I miss you though, you miss me?\n(Yes, very much, I just wish you could be here) Word? (Yes)\nOkay, I'll be there soon, aight? (You gon' be here tonight?!)\nNaw, boo-boo, I ain't gon' be there tonight (Aww)\n\nWhoo! Mmm, uhh\nUhh, uhh, uhh, uhh, c'mon\n\n[Hook 2x - Nelly]\nYeahhhhhhhhhhh.. (yeah)\nDon't you know I'll die for you? (die for you)\nI'll lay down my life for you\nI would, die for, you (die for, you)\n\n[Nelly's daughter] I love you Daddy\n\n[Nelly]\nI remember February 27, 1994\nTryin to make it to the hospital through three inches of snow (hey)\nSomethin's goin wrong, I can tell but I don't know\nI got this feelin in my gut, this ain't how it's supposed to go\nThree pounds, two ounces and two months premature\nI tell the incubator, is she gon' make it? They ain't sure\nAutomatically I place the blame on my health\nHell, I'm her father mayne, I place the blame on myself\nWas it somethin that I smoked, did I eat or did I drink it?\nOr was it somethin I was doin that I did or did I think it?\nHuh, watchin her breathe through her holes in her nose\nWhat's this EKG machine? What's this shit on her toes?\nIt's 94, I'm 85, so I'm spooked as can be (c'mon!)\nI'm prayin and I'm askin, \"Why He do this to me?\"\nSee, I used to hold you in the palm of my hand\nAnd just to see you pull through - shit I knew you'd pull through\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Nelly]\nMarch 2-2nd, 1999\nThe year and the date I got my lil' man\nI guess I felt how my father felt and his father felt\nAnd his father musta felt to see hisself\nIt's like a lil' me in the flesh\nHe got my blood and my heart in his chest\nNeedless to say, man I love him to death\nTeach him if he disrespect me I'mma love him to death\nLeft to go out of town right after he was born\nI got a record deal, three months later Daddy was gone\nIt's like I'm tryin to raise him over the phone\nHe barely know my face when he see it but he know my tone\nI'm hopin, I'm like - \"Do he know who his Daddy is?\"\nI'm real close to sayin fuck the showbiz\nBut when I hurr him call his Daddy now\nAnd when I hurr him tell his friends, \"I'ma be just like my Daddy now\"\nHope he forgive me for the sacrifice\nSo he can have a better life - than I had\n\n[Hook 2x]"}}, {"title": "Headphones", "album": "M.O.", "year": "2013-09-30",

been around, I've been around the world\nHave seen so many, many pretty girls\nBeen to Tokyo with no luck\nI left France with no luck\nFound nobody in Toronto like you\nSeen a million pretty faces\nStill ain't found one like yours\nWith a walk mean as yours\nNew bags, shoes couture\nI've been a million different places\nStill ain't found one like you\nIt's the little things you do\nThat make you so beautiful\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Bridge: Trey Songz]\nSo tell me have you seen her?\nThe one I used to know?\nTell me have you seen her?\nThe one...\n\n[Verse 2: Nelly]\nI've been to so many cities looking for you girl\nL.A. to London\nI can't find nobody nothing like you girl\nAnd ain't that something?\nLeft St. Louis with no luck, Paris with no luck\nI found nobody in Chicago like you\nSeen a million different faces\nStill ain't find one like yours\nWith a walk mean as yours\nNew shades,  clothes couture\nI've been a million different places\nStill ain't found one like you\nIt's the little things you do\nThat make you so beautiful\nAnd there's\n\n[Chorus + Bridge]\n\n[Verse 3: Trey Songz]\nBaby girl where you hiding?\nGuess I'll have to come find ya\nI'm the only

were about this high\nSame elementary, shared the same bus stop\nEven as a youngster I knew you was so fly\nEven back then I knew you were the one\nI watched you grow, I watched your transformation\nRight through school to your current occupation\nIt took this long for me to man up and have this conversation\nBut fuck it, here it go\n\n[Hook: Nelly]\nI want you, to want me\nGirl I need to know that, I can be your one and only\nI need you, to need me\nSee you were my worst mistake girl, and that's why\nIt's hard to keep my cool when I see you with him\nCause I really wish that you were right here\nTell me what's it take to win just a - piece of your heart\nMy only kryptonite is you, that's why anything you say I'll do\nSo let me stop for a minute, take a second to say\nGirl you take my breath away, awayyyy\nGirl you take my breath away (awayyyy)\nYou take my breath away, you take my breath away, yeah\n\n[Nelly - singing]\nUh, uh, uh, uh, uh\nThey say one man's trash is the next man's treasure\nWhere one finds pain the next might find pleasure\nI don't pay attention to them haters, now or never\nI don't give a damn who was before me (me)\nAll that matters is you're with me now\nAll I need to know is that you're down\nMan it's somethin special about round-the-way ladies\nRide-or-die baby, girl\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Nelly - rapping]\nYeah, on the real, let me tell you somethin..\nUhh, uhh, it's like I die a little every time I see you with this guy\nThinkin to myself, \"Now why the hell she with that guy\"\nWhile she ain't by my side, we would be so fly\nWe would live that life\nThe life you used to dream is all about rapp-in\nBack when I used to pull my BMX up alongside of your Schwinn\nSee, and here we are again\nFunny how fate brought my Phantom up alongside of your Benz\nAnd still\n\n[Hook] w/ ad libs\n\n[Outro: Nelly]\nYeah so, I mean, like I said\nYou know we been knowin each other for a long time\nYou seen me go through, I seen you go through\nWe here now and, I just thought I'd tell you that\nSo, you got my number, as you got my e-mail\nYou know everything\nSo I guess the next message I get from you\nWill let me know what you

listen\n\n[Nelly - singing]\nYou see we been knowin each other since we were about this high\nSame elementary, shared the same bus stop\nEven as a youngster I knew you was so fly\nEven back then I knew you were the one\nI watched you grow, I watched your transformation\nRight through school to your current occupation\nIt took this long for me to man up and have this conversation\nBut fuck it, here it go\n\n[Hook: Nelly]\nI want you, to want me\nGirl I need to know that, I can be your one and only\nI need you, to need me\nSee you were my worst mistake girl, and that's why\nIt's hard to keep my cool when I see you with him\nCause I really wish that you were right here\nTell me what's it take to win just a - piece of your heart\nMy only kryptonite is you, that's why anything you say I'll do\nSo let me stop for a minute, take a second to say\nGirl you take my breath away, awayyyy\nGirl you take my breath away (awayyyy)\nYou take my breath away, you take my breath away, yeah\n\n[Nelly - singing]\nUh, uh, uh, uh, uh\nThey say one man's trash is the next man's treasure\nWhere one finds pain the next might find pleasure\nI don't pay attention to them haters, now or never\nI don't give a damn who was before me (me)\nAll that matters is you're with me now\nAll I need to know is that you're down\nMan it's somethin special about round-the-way ladies\nRide-or-die baby, girl\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Nelly - rapping]\nYeah, on the real, let me tell you somethin..\nUhh, uhh, it's like I die a little every time I see you with this guy\nThinkin to myself, \"Now why the hell she with that guy\"\nWhile she ain't by my side, we would be so fly\nWe would live that life\nThe life you used to dream is all about rapp-in\nBack when I used to pull my BMX up alongside of your Schwinn\nSee, and here we are again\nFunny how fate brought my Phantom up alongside of your Benz\nAnd still\n\n[Hook] w/ ad libs\n\n[Outro: Nelly]\nYeah so, I mean, like I said\nYou know we been knowin each other for a long time\nYou seen me go through, I seen you go through\nWe here now and, I just thought I'd tell you that\nSo, you got my number, as you got my e-mail\nYou know

sayyyyy (so I'll say) hey that's my girl (that's my girl)\nAnd I'mma be the one that's gonna make her better\nAnd you gonna' always see the two of us together (yeah)\nCause when I'm goin through some things, I\nKnow that she's my day, light\nIn the middle of the darkness I can see things clearly\nBecause she's near me, yeahhhhhh\n\n[Hook: Nelly]\nAin't no way I'm letting her go\nSee I've been warned by everyone around me\nShe gonna' be the death of me, oh yeah\nBut ain't no way I'm letting her go, noooo\nSee all the money in this world\nMean nothing without her, nothing without her, yeahhhh\n\n[Nelly]\nSo they sayyyyy, she's a problem\nIt ain't nothing cause I'm known to be a solver\nAnd I ain't worried 'bout what other people call her\nSo I'll sayyyyy (so I'll say) I tamed a wild one (I tamed a wild one)\nI ain't saying I can make nobody perfect\nBut I can really see what's underneath the surface (yeah)\nCause when I look deep in her eyes, I\nSee there's love inside, I\nWanna be the one to show her, that I'm truly devoted\nShe's gonna know it, yeahhh so\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Nelly - repeat 2X]\nLet me be the reason baby let me be the cause\nLet me be the only one you let up in your heart\nLet me be the picture, that's sitting in your frame\nLet me be your lover, I'll let you be the same\n\n{*25-second guitar instrumental*}\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "For My", "album":

the scale of one to ten, I been rated, a 12 (right!)\nYou know this and these cats hate it\nI got nothin' outdated, if it is it's upgraded\nS-Class with everything voice-activated\nChrome rim three-bladed, factory custom made it\nPaid with big faces, if it's broke then replace it\nNow it's like that, purple haze and cognac\nOn the beach in L.A. with dime bitches ridin' my back\n\n[Verse 2: Lil' Wayne]\nI represent them street niggas\nWhen they get hot, carry the heat niggas\nThem sweet niggas off they feet niggas\nYou livin' on the edge Fleet nigga\nThat's why my clique we do or die and roll deep nigga\nAin't nothing sweet nigga, recognize the bloody clothes\nReady to represent the 'Grove with two Calico's\nI carry 4's in my side pocket\nWhile yours cockin' nigga mine poppin'\nWalk through your house with my iron knockin'\n\n[Chorus: Nelly]\nI'm doing this one for my niggas who be keepin' it tight\nOnly lovin' dime bitches that fuck on the first night\nThis is for my bitches with the style and grace\nWho ain't hear nothin' talkin' but the bitch in their face\nI'm doing this one for my niggas who be keepin' it tight\nOnly lovin' dime bitches that fuck on the first night\nThis is for my bitches with the style and grace\nWho ain't hear nothin' talkin' but the bitch in their face\n\n[Verse 3: Nelly]\nI ain't bullshittin', I trick 'em and run up in their kitty\nIf she ain't a nine or better, my niggas then I'm splittin'\nGet a code-red, hop in the Jag and fled\nBumpin' N.O.R.E number six, \"Bitch give me some head\"\nAnd for you niggas out there who be jacking the wrist\nGot a new group for ya, Nina Ross and the Clips\nAnd from the hip I shoot, if you wanna get loot\n'Bout ta tell ya the truth\nI'm more focused I'm born in the Lou'\n\n[Chorus: Nelly]\nI'm doing this one for my niggas who be keepin' it tight\nOnly lovin' dime bitches that fuck on the first night\nThis is for my bitches with the style and grace\nWho ain't hear nothin' talkin' but the bitch in their face\nI'm doing this one for my niggas who be keepin' it tight\nOnly lovin' dime bitches that fuck on the first night\nThis is for my bitches with the style and grace\nWho ain't hear nothin' talkin' but the bitch in their face\n\n[Verse 4: Lil' Wayne]\nI ain't no busta nigga\nCame up out that Hollygrove dungeon, nigga\nFlame up and toast let it get sparkin' up in here\nYou don't make it out alive very often up in here\nI'ma speak on behalf of the C.M.B. partna\nI'm a sweep off ya Ave if its any beef partna\nI skeet off a bag of the dilly-D partna\nSlip me on a mask hit the Benz wit three choppers\nWeezy-Wee partna\n\n[Verse 5: Nelly]\nFour karats in my earring, five around my knuckle\nSix wrap the wrist, check the belt buckle\nLeave them wit it look like Nelly I didn't know\nIf you was the Jackie Frost why didn't you say so\nSomebody gotta shine my nigga why not me\nEven my dentist told me floss 7 days a week\nFreeza burnt out the piece Gucci and hat sweet\nButter soft leather seats for trash talkin' freaks\n\n[Chorus: Nelly]\nI'm doing this one for my niggas who be keepin' it tight\nOnly lovin' dime bitches that fuck on the first night\nThis is for my bitches with the style and grace\nWho ain't hear nothin' talkin' but the bitch in their face\nI'm doing this one for my niggas who be keepin' it tight\nOnly lovin' dime bitches that fuck on the first

Nelly]\nNow on the scale of one to ten, I been rated, a 12 (right!)\nYou know this and these cats hate it\nI got nothin' outdated, if it is it's upgraded\nS-Class with everything voice-activated\nChrome rim three-bladed, factory custom made it\nPaid with big faces, if it's broke then replace it\nNow it's like that, purple haze and cognac\nOn the beach in L.A. with dime bitches ridin' my back\n\n[Verse 2: Lil' Wayne]\nI represent them street niggas\nWhen they get hot, carry the heat niggas\nThem sweet niggas off they feet niggas\nYou livin' on the edge Fleet nigga\nThat's why my clique we do or die and roll deep nigga\nAin't nothing sweet nigga, recognize the bloody clothes\nReady to represent the 'Grove with two Calico's\nI carry 4's in my side pocket\nWhile yours cockin' nigga mine poppin'\nWalk through your house with my iron knockin'\n\n[Chorus: Nelly]\nI'm doing this one for my niggas who be keepin' it tight\nOnly lovin' dime bitches that fuck on the first night\nThis is for my bitches with the style and grace\nWho ain't hear nothin' talkin' but the bitch in their face\nI'm doing this one for my niggas who be keepin' it tight\nOnly lovin' dime bitches that fuck on the first night\nThis is for my bitches with the style and grace\nWho ain't hear nothin' talkin' but the bitch in their face\n\n[Verse 3: Nelly]\nI ain't bullshittin', I trick 'em and run up in their kitty\nIf she ain't a nine or better, my niggas then I'm splittin'\nGet a code-red, hop in the Jag and fled\nBumpin' N.O.R.E number six, \"Bitch give me some head\"\nAnd for you niggas out there who be jacking the wrist\nGot a new group for ya, Nina Ross and the Clips\nAnd from the hip I shoot, if you wanna get loot\n'Bout ta tell ya the truth\nI'm more focused I'm born in the Lou'\n\n[Chorus: Nelly]\nI'm doing this one for my niggas who be keepin' it tight\nOnly lovin' dime bitches that fuck on the first night\nThis is for my bitches with the style and grace\nWho ain't hear nothin' talkin' but the bitch in their face\nI'm doing this one for my niggas who be keepin' it tight\nOnly lovin' dime bitches that fuck on the first night\nThis is for my bitches with the style and grace\nWho ain't hear nothin' talkin' but the bitch in their face\n\n[Verse 4: Lil' Wayne]\nI ain't no busta nigga\nCame up out that Hollygrove dungeon, nigga\nFlame up and toast let it get sparkin' up in here\nYou don't make it out alive very often up in here\nI'ma speak on behalf of the C.M.B. partna\nI'm a sweep off ya Ave if its any beef partna\nI skeet off a bag of the dilly-D partna\nSlip me on a mask hit the Benz wit three choppers\nWeezy-Wee partna\n\n[Verse 5: Nelly]\nFour karats in my earring, five around my knuckle\nSix wrap the wrist, check the belt buckle\nLeave them wit it look like Nelly I didn't know\nIf you was the Jackie Frost why didn't you say so\nSomebody gotta shine my nigga why not me\nEven my dentist told me floss 7 days a week\nFreeza burnt out the piece Gucci and hat sweet\nButter soft leather seats for trash talkin' freaks\n\n[Chorus: Nelly]\nI'm doing this one for my niggas who be keepin' it tight\nOnly lovin' dime bitches that fuck on the first night\nThis is for my bitches with the style and grace\nWho ain't hear nothin' talkin' but the bitch in their face\nI'm doing this one for my niggas who be keepin' it tight\nOnly lovin' dime bitches that fuck on the first night\nThis is for my bitches with the style and grace\nWho ain't hear nothin' talkin' but the bitch in their face\nI'm doing this one for my niggas\n\n[Outro:

they've ever, ever been before\nI'm not just braggin', I'm just sayin' I ain't gotta think about that shit no more\nAll of a sudden, I'm the man wherever I go (oh)\nScreamin' fans got to stands now at my shows (oh)\nHeard there's a party and the niggas at 'The Palm' try to figure out should I go (oh)\nThought about it for a minute then I said\nHmm...(hell yea)\n\n[Hook]\nI wanna know if you wanna ride (wanna ride)\nWanna go and take a ride with me (oh)\nI know a place where we can chill them (oh)\nAnd don't worry I got plenty money\nHey, hey...hey\nI wanna know if you wanna ride (wanna

this\nPicture on the news, yeah they see about this\nEven in the paper they gon' read about this\nCause all of my life\nTraining day and night\nI\u2019m preparing to fight\nFor everyone I believed in\nI was going insane, they were screaming our name\nWhile were spraying champagne\nThere\u2019s nothing nobody can say\n\n[Hook]\nCause today is the day\nIs the day that I have always dreamed of forever\nWhen you call me\nYou call me the champ of the world\nI can raise my hands\nI can scream I\u2019m the best in the world\nWhole world\nAll my blood, sweat and grind\nWas all for this time\n\n[Verse 2]\nLap after lap, mile after mile\nPush up after push up\nEverybody count it out\nEverybody up, now we back down\nAll my pain and sweat was for this moment right now\nAll from different places well we came with each other\nWe came together as a team\nBut we\u2019re leaving as brothers\nStanding next to one another while we hold up our colors\nI\u2019m gon\u2019 look in to

1]\nYou see Biggie be like, \"What's Beef?\"\nMe I'm like what's weed?\nWeed is actually a medicine for me, you know\nEvery 4 hours like a prescription I smoke\nAnd I'm thanking my reefer chief for making me choke\nI'm like one of those half-baked thugs, I'm in love\nThen after that roll cool \"J's\" I mean bud\n'Cause I still piss stems and still shit seeds\nI spit residue smoke on my way to buy weed\nWrap Sumden, always I smoke more then Cheech and Chong\nMy best friend's a bong and my homies is smokers only\nI know one day, I'm gone stop\nBut that'll be the day when my seeds don't pop\nYou see weed helps me get my thoughts together quick\nBut on the other hand, as soon as I'm sober I forget\nShit, I'm still stuck at point \"A\" ya dig\nAnd my momma think that I should quit\n\n[Chorus]\nAyo, this is no lie-ie-ie\nMe and my niggas gettin' high-igh-igh\nYo, if you look up in the sky-y-y\nYou might see us floating by-y-y\nAyo, this is no lie-ie-ie\nMe and my niggas

sick now, I think I'm catching glaucoma\nStanding on the corner, looking for weed donors\nYou know how we do it kid. We get that good herb and swerve\nTill the gas run out, the way we smokes absurd\nThat's my word, Wrap Sumden (Wrap Sumden)\nMake a nigga clap something, get all mad and slap something\nYo, grab the towels cover the smoke alarms and doors\nSee I smoke alone, I need grass like lawn mowers\nSay dutch time, roll up it's clutch time\nAnd I burn mine, don't you ever, ever touch mine\nFire it up, dog, but watch out for 5-0\nEyes low from plenty Henny and hydro\nFuck a bitch and some clothes, I gotta get rich\nGo platinum and do some shows, and get blowed\n\n[Chorus]\nAyo, this is no lie-ie-ie\nMe and my niggas gettin' high-igh-igh\nYo, if you look up in the sky-y-y\nYou might see us floating by-y-y\nAyo, this is no lie-ie-ie\nMe and my niggas gettin' high-igh-igh\nYo, if you look up in the sky-y-y\nYou might see us floating by-y-y\n\n[Verse 3]\nAll I know, is money making hoes and smoking endo\nIf I wasn't high I'd probably know a little more\nBut since I don't some might consider me slow\nDon't worry though\nI keep the pants sag, bubble eye hands rag\nEyes glassed smoking fill from the hash\nChoking after that but don't the blunt pass\n\"What we doin' today?\" Same shit we did last week\nWake up in the morning and yawn and roll up\nBag up and make some runs and roll up\n5-0 behind me my niggas so hold up\nOkay, made a left so continue to roll up\nDon't get me wrong police, yo I stop for them\nBut guaranteed when they leave I'll be smoking again\nCatch my second wind and start in on my next bag\nThe type of nigga smoke on the way to his rehab\n\n[Chorus]\nAyo, this is no lie-ie-ie\nMe and my niggas gettin' high-igh-igh\nYo, if you look up in the sky-y-y\nYou might see us floating by-y-y\nAyo, this is no lie-ie-ie\nMe and my niggas gettin' high-igh-igh\nYo, if you look up in the sky-y-y\nYou might see us floating by-y-y\nAyo, this is no lie-ie-ie\nMe and my niggas gettin' high-igh-igh\nYo, if you look up in the sky-y-y\nYou might see us floating by-y-y"}}, {"title": "Batter Up (Jay E Remix)", "album": "Da Derrty Versions - The Reinvention", "year": "2003-11-25", "lyrics": "Hands up now {*repeat 14X*}\n\n[Hook: Nelly]\nMmmmmm, I'm from where they cook the work in the kitchen (in the kitchen)\nWhy you think we rock these platinum gold grills (gold grills)\nIt take a whoooole lot of gr-indin\nTo put the Daytons on that Cadillac DeVille (well alright!)\nI say but now we're up in the BIG LEAGUES\nSt. Louis, y'all up at bat (uh-huh)\nAnd just as long as we livin (what about it) it's Lunatics playa\nDerrty E.N.T., we all we got - ohh, batter up!\n\n[Ali]\nCheck check..

where they cook the work in the kitchen (in the kitchen)\nWhy you think we rock these platinum gold grills (gold grills)\nIt take a whoooole lot of gr-indin\nTo put the Daytons on that Cadillac DeVille (well alright!)\nI say but now we're up in the BIG LEAGUES\nSt. Louis, y'all up at bat (uh-huh)\nAnd just as long as we livin (what about it) it's Lunatics playa\nDerrty E.N.T., we all we got - ohh, batter up!\n\n[Ali]\nCheck check.. I'm the lead-off batter\nShootin dice in the dugout, they gon' walk me, it don't matter\nMovin up the ladder, Derrty E.N.T. we came fatter\nThey think my bat quicker, they check it every time it shatter\n(Skerr-ERRRT!) She threw a knuckleball\nThe rookie ran down for one, I walked down and fucked 'em all\nI keep it mellow, she one-point-five, I'm Cigarello\nFirst base, Chocolate Tai come move the place\n\n[Chocolate Tai]\nNow who the hell left the gate open cause it stayed open\nThese haters prayin and hopin that it's not Chocolate\nDon't pop the verses, I pop a lot\nPULL UP SLOWWWWW! Pop a drop and still got fans in my five for naught\nBeen in the game for a minute, always represent it\nCocoa tenants, so-so Dior's in it - ooh gotta love her\nMiss Loiusville slugga, try to tag, I can't touch ya\nFor her, DEA they tryin hard to fuck her\n\n[Hook]\n\n[King Jacob]\nYo, c'mon... as I approach the plate\nMy approach is great, 34 I'm fat, I'm holdin weight\nKnown for extra bases, got them extra cakes and pies\nThrow 'em in extra basements, get them straight to go by ride\nHeat don't wear me out, so that's cool, I doubled up\nThat mean the Benz get bubbled-up and your friends can come and stuff\nI got bad nerves, no patience, up and stealin third\nNigga pass the word, Derrty E.N.T., fuck what you heard\nMost my niggas foul, cookin off the mans now\nIf I can make it home again I'd give my hat to the crowd\nThey in the stands cheerin loud, once the King takes up the scope\nAnticipatin for mo', intoxicated the flows\nMy derrties make hits for sho' so I ain't stranded no mo'\nYou gotta be drunk, mad full of dope thinkin we handin it over\nIf I ain't, passin the doja, and addin the dough up\nThat mean it's, guess I'mma load up, see yo' ass in the hole up - KING\n\n[Tru]\nYeah, and I couldn't wait to swing\nWith more blow than George Young on a Chinese bing\nI'm a 16-year old drug dealer, with brick skills\nThat's where they sell it all, I'mma ball and make a mil'\nYou can see me now, I got them treaties now\nI got them ounces and birds, I'm on the curb gettin greedy now\nNo shame in my 'caine - bakin soda, ain't my thang\nPut your mouth on this pipe, and go and blow out your brain\nI got that +Base+ like Rob, hit it your face throb\nShitty shark jumpin out the entourage like the mob\nMove bricks like a demolitionist, never miss a hit\nFirst round draft pick, money stretch long like elastic\nJack Frost put it in plastic\nHit the bricks, the shit flip quick, like gymnastics\nPlatinum and the gold grills, big ol' wheels\nIt's Taylor Made, Derrty Entertainment, Nelly what the diz-eal?\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Prentiss Church]\nAhhhh I wanna hit somethin, rip somethin, stick somethin\nPants saggin in my battin stance, set and ready - SWING, the pitch comin!\nDouble up like Ozzy do, halves, fifties and boppers too\nWe robbin you like over-the-wall grabs and how are you (safe!)\nAnd I can stone on you, umpires tryin to throw me out\nFuck the game he don't know me, I'll show him what I'm all about\nS-T-L-O-U-I-S; e'rrrrybody like \"You the best\"\nThat's why I got the Derrty medallion with diamonds on my chest\nThey got me playin center, and yup I'm still the center of attention\nThe gun to most niggas in this division\nI got a rifle of an arm, I'm skinny but I perform\nI'm calm but still slept on like \"Ring the Alarm\"\nTwo corns on my big toe, lil' toe nail gone\nI'm runnin through the catcher, whatever, to get the hell home\nWell-known, line drive, head gone, headstrong\nDerrty E.N.T. get in that ass - so you can head home\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Nelly]\nWell you should see me now, white Lambourghini now\nAin't really got nowhurr to park it but funk it, I got it anyhow\nOnly thing left for me to do is to \"Dream of Jeanie\" now\nSmokin gabrini greenie now - but I ain't shy\nI'mma go with white socks, and burrs on my team\nI used to cut it, cook it, and place it - then purrs on the Beam\nUsed to slang that coke-y like Sammy Sosa\nI would tell ya more but I ain't supposed ta\n\n[Murphy Lee]\nI want my name not, not said but screamed\nCause I finally seen \"my dream\" like Martin Luther the King\nMy pockets fat cause I been eatin since, '99\nPut rhymes between fine lines, time to shine\nI'm a 20 year-old silly dude, wit a Derrty deal\nThe biggest problem I got is gettin the spinners for my sturring wheel\nI'm in the Coupe DeVille, left side in the back seat\nFront seat be the good weed, back seat be the ass cheeks\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Nelly]\nUhh... swing batter batter, swing if you wanna hit now BATTER UP!\nUhh...

Kingshighway\nAs loud as possible (that's what I'm talkin about, gon shine my shit up)\nNatural Bridge and Kingshighway (yeah)\nAsk em' Where you headed?\nNatural Bridge and Kingshighway (yeah)\nNatural Bridge and Kingshighway (St. Louis shake it)\n\n[Verse 1]\nCome on with it\nIt's me and my derrty we just got back home\nIn the blue grey Bentley with the cellular phone\nCallin' up the 'Tics (you know) it's time to get it jumpin'\nSmoke comin' out the sunroof to let you know we're comin'\nEverybody looking if you're jealous turn around\n21 inches keep me further from the ground\nI'm gettin good grip from the Dunlop Tires\nThe F1's bumpin' but I need the volume higher\nCause the 808 kick drum Basement Beats hits son\nJay-E and Wally got it knocking (you wanna) dirty get some\nI heard them haters talkin' but what am I to do?\nI'm the man they love to hate the Bill Clinton of the Lou\nPicked up some shorties on Skinker towards Wellston\nHeaded for the Castle lot moscato got me croachin\nBently kinda crowded the whole car was leanin' back\nShandra watchin' TV with two gurlies on their lap (man)\nMartin Luther King the set is kind of dead\nMade a left on Kingshighway Natural Bridge is just ahead\nSo fresh and so clean U City representin'\nThe St Lunatics on that Castle lot set\n\n[Hook]\n(Tell it) Where you headed?\nNatural Bridge and Kingshighway (uhh uhh)\nWe gon' make it knock, 'Tics gon' make it fuck\nNatural Bridge and Kingshighway\nCome on with it\nWhere you headed?\nNatural Bridge and Kingshighway\nBasement Beats gon' make it knock, 'Tics gon' make it rock\nNatural Bridge and Kingshighway\nCome on with it\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow rollin' with the 'Tics you know we never bored\nShow me another clique when more points scored\nWe walk around with criminals a bunch of big gorillas\nMy dirty Murphy Lee he's a teenage lady killer\nKyjuan is on my left side dancin' with this freak\nThe way she clap that ass make my knees get weak\nJD is the white guy people think he's funny\nBeen down long time way before we had the money\nBut now we collectin' dollars from platinum to white gold\nSwervin' in this Bentley and ain't got no place to go\nRollin' past Fairground what's up to the thugs\nShorties in their mini's wanna show a nigga love\nBut the dope man got em and they butts just drop\nShorties looked depressed cause that thing gon' stop\nHeaded back toward Union bust a Uie what the hell\nSomebody shoutin' Nelly we're damn near out of L's\nBaby girl blew me a kiss said \"you're number one\"\nThen looked over to me and I ain't gon tell you what she done\nThe closer we get the woozier I feel\nNatural Bridge and Kingshighway somebody take the wheel\n\n[Hook]\nWhere you headed?\nNatural Bridge and Kingshighway (St. Louis)\nBasement beats gon' make it knock, 'Tics gon' make it rock\nNatural Bridge and Kingshighway (dirty)\nCome on with it\nWhere you headed? (uhh)\nNatural Bridge and Kingshighway\nBasement Beats gon' make it knock, 'Tics gon' make it rock\nNatural Bridge and Kingshighway\nCome on with it\n\n[Verse 3]\nRolling Natural Bridge and we bumped in the store\nMobbing with the 'Tics is the only way to go\nFour shorties by McDonald's was looking for a ride\nWe in the wide body so it's plenty room inside\nWe put two by the trunk, one on the hood\nOne on my lap, don't it feel good\nPosse's getting deeper, we still looking for freaks\nAin't worried about them tripping cuz three got that heat\nNow them shorties getting hungry and Jackie Frost treating\nWe stopped at Burger King for some royalty eating\nBut Burger King was closed, the girls started to hassle\nSaid \"man, go back the other way I want some White Castle\"\nNow this is the place where the dubs hang out\nThe new shits is cool but old schools get the clout\nPosse's so damn big what the fuck you want to do\nI'm getting dirty looks from those other rapper crews\nAli dropped a hundred, I tripped off what he done\nNow should I pick it up? No, drop another one\nSome nigga started tripping cuz his girl was in my face\nI told Big B to chill cuz he ain't worth the case\nAnd I ain't with the smacking and beating up on your girl\nIf your Pimp Juice is low, then let her leave your world\nWe took his girl with us (us) I seen him on the bus (bus)\nHe beating on the window and it damn near about to bust (man)\nI got a tight clique, you got a bunch of dudes\nNow you're broke cold crying them St. Louis Blues\nWe rolled off with your girl and now you all upset\nShe with that Country Grammer boy and them St. Lunatics (uhh)\n\n[Hook]\n(Check it) Where you headed?\nNatural Bridge and Kingshighway (uhh uhh)\nBasement beats gon' make it knock, 'Tics gon' make it rock\nNatural Bridge and Kingshighway\nCome on with it\n(Tell me) Where you headed?\nNatural Bridge and Kingshighway (listen to me)\nBasement Beats gon' make it knock, 'Tics gon' make it rock\nNatural Bridge and Kingshighway\nCome on with it\n\nHo ho ho ho ho ho ho ho\nBasement Beats gon' make it knock, 'Tics gon' make it rock\nYo if you ain't tens or better 12s or getting leather\nIf you ain't tens or better 12s woods or leather"}}, {"title": "Intro", "album": "Country Grammar", "year": "2000-06-27", "lyrics": "[Intro: Nelly & Cedric the Entertainer]\nYou know who it is, do what you do\nYo, ay, Nelly, what's up dog?

night, matter of fact I'm still drunk\nBaby please don't fight, got to get you off my chest\nBaby came home now I am laying on your chest\nLay out this California king watch you making around my bed\nI ain't trying to go away try to see you pull away\nTry to open my eyes and say\n\nIt's 5 o'clock in the morning\nAlone and you know you love me babe\nWhen I am on you get the best o me baby\nSo I am standing on the other side of the mirror\nThinking about the shit that I did\nTry to lock you up try to be no hater\nAny nigga beside me make you feel better\nGuess you wanna go\nPlease can you go when the sun come up and numbers say\nIt's 5 o'clock in the morning\nLet me make it up for you call your momma she know that\nI fuck with you cause she know that I get distracted\nJust like your daddy did see he was there when he count it ..\nI might do it every time\nSince we on tha top of the time\nLook at ya watch\n\n[Hook]\n\nIt's 5 o'clock in the morning\nConversation got boring\nYou

got nothing on my hands but time, tell me\nWere you the one that's on the grind, if you're going to ride\nGet inside, lets roll, if you're running your mouth\nThen, shit, then shut my door, I ain't got nothing on my hands but time\nTell me, were you the one that's on the grind\nCheck it, was it you that was on the grind dirty\n\n[Verse 1: Nelly]\nThey acting like they really want it with me, trust me\nThey don't really want it, they just want to be seen\nThey want to disrupt my team with these publicity schemes\nTrying to dismantle my panel with lies, rumours and scandals\nBut uh, I pull through it like I'm tugging a war\nI tell you the situation like I've been here before\nI'm still popping dirty, still smoking, point clicking\nWatching the doors open, no joking, everything's remoting\nNo choking or bleeding, this ride is for free, no matter what\nYou got your dying for free, automatically\nI'm focused like thirty five millimetres, all of the sudden\nLike such and such wants to meet us, all of the sudden\nLike such and such wants to greet us, the same, will you believe us\nNow, they're all trying to cheat us, in real life, they can't beat us\nSometimes, they try to repeat us\n\n[Hook]\nNow if you're going to ride, get inside, lets roll\nIf you're running your mouth, then, shit, then shut my door\nI ain't got nothing on my hands but time, tell me\nWere you the

holding the keys, tell me\nThem type of people don't be holding no heat, no\nThen how the fuck they gon' be rolling with me, yeah\nDude, how the hell you ain't going to waste your time, wait your time\nYour mouth's going to fuck around and going to waste your time, hey\nI told them niggas' that ain't going to grind\nWhen its peso time, come out and take your shine dirty\nI'm the same nigga that's out of control, out of control\nI put a little malinger out on the roll, hey, the bigger it just got\nThe calico, I been cocking and loading, I been popping them fours, yeah\nSet that aside cause I've got to get those, got to get those\nThe finest shit than what you're proud of me for, tell me\nThe dirty, either you going to ride or you don't, yeah\nInside there's more shit, if not,

if I want it, if I don't put it against it\nThe way that I should spend it to get just how I should\nAll money ain't good money but no money ain't good\nI took the hood tactics and plot with musical talents\nTrying to create a balance in between Minnesota and Dallas\nNever matters when I'm speaking, if you're peeping, just let me know\nI'm guaranteed to keep it cracking, just like eggs hitting the floor\nI'm dotting, just want to be, I ask, clipping the wings\nI want to fly ass, only Q and D Miles can look down on me\nMaybe, I should bee bee in my head, I put it down, homie\n\n[Hook

"[Introduction]\nUh, yeah, swing, Nel, my dirty Jacob, yeah, come on\n\n[Hook]\nNow if you're going to ride, get inside, lets roll\nIf you're running your mouth, then, shit, then shut my door\nI ain't got nothing on my hands but time, tell me\nWere you the one that's on the grind, if you're going to ride\nGet inside, lets roll, if you're running your mouth\nThen, shit, then shut my door, I ain't got nothing on my hands but time\nTell me, were you the one that's on the grind\nCheck it, was it you that was on the grind dirty\n\n[Verse 1: Nelly]\nThey acting like they really want it with me, trust me\nThey don't really want it, they just want to be seen\nThey want to disrupt my team with these publicity schemes\nTrying to dismantle my panel with lies, rumours and scandals\nBut uh, I pull through it like I'm tugging a war\nI tell you the situation like I've been here before\nI'm still popping dirty, still smoking, point clicking\nWatching the doors open, no joking, everything's remoting\nNo choking or bleeding, this ride is for free, no matter what\nYou got your dying for free, automatically\nI'm focused like thirty five millimetres, all of the sudden\nLike such and such wants to meet us, all of the sudden\nLike such and such wants to greet us, the same, will you believe us\nNow, they're all trying to cheat us, in real life, they can't beat us\nSometimes, they try to repeat us\n\n[Hook]\nNow if you're going to ride, get inside, lets roll\nIf you're running your mouth, then, shit, then shut my door\nI ain't got nothing on my hands but time, tell me\nWere you the one that's on the grind, if you're going to ride\nGet inside, lets roll, if you're running your mouth\nThen, shit, then shut my door, I ain't got nothing on my hands but time\nTell me, were you the one that's on the grind\nCheck it, was it you that was on the grind dirty\n\n[Verse 2: King Jacob]\nWhy is they yacking like they fucking with these, I don't know\nWhy is they stunting like they holding the keys, tell me\nThem type of people don't be holding no heat, no\nThen how the fuck they gon' be rolling with me, yeah\nDude, how the hell you ain't going to waste your time, wait your time\nYour mouth's going to fuck around and going to waste your time, hey\nI told them niggas' that ain't going to grind\nWhen its peso time, come out and take your shine dirty\nI'm the same nigga that's out of control, out of control\nI put a little malinger out on the roll, hey, the bigger it just got\nThe calico, I been cocking and loading, I been popping them fours, yeah\nSet that aside cause I've got to get those, got to get those\nThe finest shit than what you're proud of me for, tell me\nThe dirty, either you going to ride or you don't, yeah\nInside there's more shit, if not, we're gone, nigga\n\n[Hook]\nNow if you're going to ride, get inside, lets roll\nIf you're running your mouth, then, shit, then shut my door\nI ain't got nothing on my hands but time, tell me\nWere you the one that's on the grind, if you're going to ride\nGet inside, lets roll, if you're running your mouth\nThen, shit, then shut my door, I ain't got nothing on my hands but time\nTell me, were you the one that's on the grind\nCheck it, was it you that was on the grind dirty\n\n[Bridge]\nUh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, you tell them, watch me now, I'm spiffy now\nSmoke sticky now and the misses' pick me now, you tell them\nWatch me now, I'm spiffy now\nSmoke sticky now and the misses' pick me now\n\n[Verse 3: Nelly]\nWell, if I said it, I've done it, if I've done it, I did it\nAnd if I, and if I want it, if I don't put it against it\nThe way that I should spend it to get just how I should\nAll money ain't good money but no money ain't good\nI took the hood tactics and plot with musical talents\nTrying to create a balance in between Minnesota and Dallas\nNever matters when I'm speaking, if you're peeping, just let me know\nI'm guaranteed to keep it cracking, just like eggs hitting the floor\nI'm dotting, just want to be, I ask, clipping the wings\nI want to fly ass, only Q and D Miles can look down on me\nMaybe, I should bee bee in my head, I put it down, homie\n\n[Hook x2]\nNow if you're going to ride, get inside, lets roll\nIf you're running your mouth, then, shit, then shut my door\nI ain't got nothing on my hands but time, tell me\nWere you the one that's on the grind, if you're going to ride\nGet inside, lets roll, if you're running your mouth\nThen, shit, then shut my door, I ain't got nothing on my hands but time\nTell me, were you the one that's on the grind\nCheck it, was it you that was on the grind dirty\n\n[Bridge]\nUh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, you tell them, watch me now, I'm spiffy now\nSmoke sticky now and the misses' pick me now, you tell

through in a Hummer, Murphy the Don, Lizzie, Kyjuan\nWith the best thunder than Sean John, you don't want none\nPartner, I got a rep for leaving heads swollen up\nOn top of all that, I got the rap sewed up\nHold up, with the budda thumpin' niggas quota\nAnd just the teach a lesson, I put one in ya shoulder\nI told ya, 'Tics live for the street life\nEat right, fuck good, and reefer thru the Pipe\nI'm gettin' head all night, and if it's some beef\nI pumpin' lead on sight until they deceased\nI took ya head off right, I live in the Beast\nNigga, where the feds, play Sheist, I still floss ice\nKeep it tight errtime, call me the Black\nLiberace when I'm playing mine, that's how I flow\nI gotta get mine, partner, any way it go\nWhether it be rapping or with the 4-4\n\n[Chorus]\nLet's make a million, keep it real for Triple-0\nEyes low, from plenty Henny and Hydro\nFuck a bitch and some clothes, I gotta get rich, go\nPlatinum and do shows and get the dough\nLet's make a million, keep it real for Triple-0\nEyes low, from plenty Henny and Hydro\nFuck a bitch and some clothes, I gotta get rich, go\nPlatinum and do shows and get the dough\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy nigga, I can make a million blind-folded, with no shows\nUsing no flows, just Arm-n-Hammer and four O's\nGimmie low-do's and a connect, that is never closed\nAnd watch me lock it down from North County to BenRos\nFuck some Mo-Mo's, gimme hundred spokes, all chrome\nOn the Navigata equipped to click and log on\nI leave that, before its gone 'fore they even bring it home\nMatter of fact, I'll tell you whats in the back, its all gone\nTwo holes in the roof, to let the sun come in\nMatch it leather car seat, in case my son get in\nI spare one off in the back in case he brings his friend\nPlayStation just in case a nigga think he can win\n\n[Chorus]\nLet's make a million, keep it real for Triple-0\nEyes low, from plenty Henny and Hydro\nFuck a bitch and some clothes, I gotta get rich, go\nPlatinum and do shows

dough\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nI gotta make a million\nGotta get myself a million\nGonna turn that into a billion\nIf not, then I just won't die\n\n[Verse 3]\nI say now, tho yo wrappers off in the air\nBut only if the ice on your wrist cause glurrs, I'm gettin'\nStares from dime bitches, is he alone, where's his Mrs\n1-2-3-4-5 bottles of Cris's\nOn the Table, arms the strong rip off the Label\nNo more shows for free, I'm pay-per-view like Cable\nThey all screamin' my name, different shades and race\nTake them all backstage and let 'em plead they case\nMake a million like Jigga, standin' in one place\nSound Scan like Thrilla without changin' my face\nThey threw a weak plan B says who? (Says Mase)\nThen what's plan A 'cause plan B about papes\n\n[Chorus]\nLet's make a million, keep it real for Triple-0\nEyes low, from plenty Henny and Hydro\nFuck a bitch and some clothes, I gotta get rich, go\nPlatinum and do shows and get the dough\nLet's make a million, keep it real for Triple-0\nEyes low, from plenty Henny and Hydro\nFuck a bitch and some clothes, I gotta get rich,

none\nPartner, I got a rep for leaving heads swollen up\nOn top of all that, I got the rap sewed up\nHold up, with the budda thumpin' niggas quota\nAnd just the teach a lesson, I put one in ya shoulder\nI told ya, 'Tics live for the street life\nEat right, fuck good, and reefer thru the Pipe\nI'm gettin' head all night, and if it's some beef\nI pumpin' lead on sight until they deceased\nI took ya head off right, I live in the Beast\nNigga, where the feds, play Sheist, I still floss ice\nKeep it tight errtime, call me the Black\nLiberace when I'm playing mine, that's how I flow\nI gotta get mine, partner, any way it go\nWhether it be rapping or with the 4-4\n\n[Chorus]\nLet's make a million, keep it real for Triple-0\nEyes low, from plenty Henny and Hydro\nFuck a bitch and some clothes, I gotta get rich, go\nPlatinum and do shows and get the dough\nLet's make a million, keep it real for Triple-0\nEyes low, from plenty Henny and Hydro\nFuck a bitch and some clothes, I gotta get rich, go\nPlatinum and do shows and get the dough\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy nigga, I can make a million blind-folded, with no shows\nUsing no flows, just Arm-n-Hammer and four O's\nGimmie low-do's and a connect, that is never closed\nAnd watch me lock it down from North County to BenRos\nFuck some Mo-Mo's, gimme hundred spokes, all chrome\nOn the Navigata equipped to click and log on\nI leave that, before its gone 'fore they even bring it home\nMatter of fact, I'll tell you whats in the back, its all gone\nTwo holes in the roof, to let the sun come in\nMatch it leather car seat, in case my son get in\nI spare one off in the back in case he brings his friend\nPlayStation just in case a nigga think he can win\n\n[Chorus]\nLet's make a million, keep it real for Triple-0\nEyes low, from plenty Henny and Hydro\nFuck a bitch and some clothes, I gotta get rich, go\nPlatinum and do shows and get the dough\nLet's make a million, keep it real for Triple-0\nEyes low, from plenty Henny and Hydro\nFuck a bitch and some clothes, I gotta get rich, go\nPlatinum and do shows and get the dough\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nI gotta make a million\nGotta get myself a million\nGonna turn that into a billion\nIf not, then I just won't die\n\n[Verse 3]\nI say now, tho yo wrappers off in the air\nBut only if the ice on your wrist cause glurrs, I'm gettin'\nStares from dime bitches, is he alone, where's his Mrs\n1-2-3-4-5 bottles of Cris's\nOn the Table, arms the strong rip off the Label\nNo more shows for free, I'm pay-per-view like Cable\nThey all screamin' my name, different shades and race\nTake them all backstage and let 'em plead they case\nMake a million like Jigga, standin' in one place\nSound Scan like Thrilla without changin' my face\nThey threw a weak plan B says who? (Says Mase)\nThen what's plan A 'cause plan B about papes\n\n[Chorus]\nLet's make a million, keep it real for Triple-0\nEyes low, from plenty Henny and Hydro\nFuck a bitch and some clothes, I gotta get rich, go\nPlatinum and do shows and get the dough\nLet's make a million, keep it real for Triple-0\nEyes low, from plenty Henny and Hydro\nFuck a bitch and some clothes, I gotta get rich, go\nPlatinum and do shows and get the dough\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nI gotta make a million\nGotta get myself a million\nGonna turn that into a billion\nIf not, then I just won't die\n\n[Outro]\nAll my Midwest niggas tryna make a mill\nTho dem wrappas (and the Dough-O)\nAll my Dirty South niggas tryna make a mill\nTho dem wrappas (and the Dough-O)\nAll my West Coast niggas tryna make a mill\nTho dem wrappas (and the Dough-O)\nAll my East Coast niggas tryna make a mill\nTho dem wrappas (and the Dough-O)"}}, {"title": "Splurge", "album": "Nellyville", "year": "2002-06-25", "lyrics": "[Hook]\nYou see the magazines and\nMe on your TV screens and\nYou think you know me but you really dont (You dont even know)\nBut I, I'm feelin good about myself, so I, I splurge a lil' hell\nYou see the money and\nThe cars and diamonds and you\nYou think it make me but it really dont (It really really dont)\nBut I, I'm feelin good about myself, so I, I splurge a lil' hell\n\n[Verse 1: Nelly]\nI think the time has come, for me to have some fun\nI'm bout to peel back the top go on and let in the sun\nWhat the fuck I done done, my mamma's only son\nI went from slangin and bangin to yellin number one\nI love my fans to death, until my last breath\nThats why when I perform I give until there's nothing left\nNo competition, my opposition gonna feel the pain\nMore complications, relationships ain't gonna be the same\nDo they want the fame, and all that it can bring\nIf they attracted to Nelly then who like Cornell Haynes\nI'm poppin collars from California to D.C\nI'm in the VIP, Louis bottles and Hennessey\nI'm putting mileage on 20 inches and 23's\nI'm flippin out my keys, I'm flippin down the screens\nI'm bout to spread my wings, tryin to fulfill my dreams\nWith anything that I want, if I don't I got the means\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Nelly]\nYou think you know me but you really dont know\nPeep I could walk through the club like everything be fo sho\nAnd I'll get, one lil' girl, two lil' girls tryin yo get me to dance\nI'll get, three lil' girls, four lil' girls pullin at my pants, damn\nIt feels good when errthing is okay\nAnd its a beautiful site when errthing goes your way\nAnd I could park in the mountains and I'll still get valet\nHop out in a Vokal valour and my suede Bally's\nI'm feeling good its only right I deserve\nTo spread the love through all my peeps, its only right that I splurge\nAnd any nigga trippin now I leave him right by the curb\nAnd I dont go to sleep mama so good night and good word\nI'm on a mission and its sort a like a mystery\nAnd I ain't stopping til' I go down in history\nNow who ever said you knows, you dealing with a pimp fo sho\nThe N-E double L-Y follow now, now here we go\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Nelly]\nYou read the magazines, and heard I made a scene\nBelieve it or not, I swear I'm just a human being\nI'm doing human things, cuz only humans change\nThey label me a role model cuz I appeal to teens\nIt really ain't that strange, now that I think about it\nI came up in the game, changed everything about it\nI'm feelin better then ever without that Lotto shit\nI wake up early hit Cuda, like lets go by some shit\nYou dress the hottest fits, driven the hottest whips\nWe've got the baddest chicks, we with the whitest kicks\nDonating money to family's caught in Bin Laden's shit\nThey screaming war, I'm like fuck it, go buy a battleship\nAnd bring it up that Mississipi, if you really wanna come than get me\nTell them niggas that a, don't tempt me\nCuz I'll squeeze them shits til' empty\nThrow shouts at nigga like frisbee\nWho the juice?

"[Hook]\nYou see the magazines and\nMe on your TV screens and\nYou think you know me but you really dont (You dont even know)\nBut I, I'm feelin good about myself, so I, I splurge a lil' hell\nYou see the money and\nThe cars and diamonds and you\nYou think it make me but it really dont (It really really dont)\nBut I, I'm feelin good about myself, so I, I splurge a lil' hell\n\n[Verse 1: Nelly]\nI think the time has come, for me to have some fun\nI'm bout to peel back the top go on and let in the sun\nWhat the fuck I done done, my mamma's only son\nI went from slangin and bangin to yellin number one\nI love my fans to death, until my last breath\nThats why when I perform I give until there's nothing left\nNo competition, my opposition gonna feel the pain\nMore complications, relationships ain't gonna be the same\nDo they want the fame, and all that it can bring\nIf they attracted to Nelly then who like Cornell Haynes\nI'm poppin collars from California to D.C\nI'm in the VIP, Louis bottles and Hennessey\nI'm putting mileage on 20 inches and 23's\nI'm flippin out my keys, I'm flippin down the screens\nI'm bout to spread my wings, tryin to fulfill my dreams\nWith anything that I want, if I don't I got the means\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Nelly]\nYou think you know me but you really dont know\nPeep I could walk through the club like everything be fo sho\nAnd I'll get, one lil' girl, two lil' girls tryin yo get me to dance\nI'll get, three lil' girls, four lil' girls pullin at my pants, damn\nIt feels good when errthing is okay\nAnd its a beautiful site when errthing goes your way\nAnd I could park in the mountains and I'll still get valet\nHop out in a Vokal valour and my suede Bally's\nI'm feeling good its only right I deserve\nTo spread the love through all my peeps, its only right that I splurge\nAnd any nigga trippin now I leave him right by the curb\nAnd I dont go to sleep mama so good night and good word\nI'm on a mission and its sort a like a mystery\nAnd I ain't stopping til' I go down in history\nNow who ever said you knows, you dealing with a pimp fo sho\nThe N-E double L-Y follow now, now here we go\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Nelly]\nYou read the magazines, and heard I made a scene\nBelieve it or not, I swear I'm just a human being\nI'm doing human things, cuz only humans change\nThey label me a role model cuz I appeal to teens\nIt really ain't that strange, now that I think about it\nI came up in the game, changed everything about it\nI'm feelin better then ever without that Lotto shit\nI wake up early hit Cuda, like lets go by some shit\nYou dress the hottest fits, driven the hottest whips\nWe've got the baddest chicks, we with the whitest kicks\nDonating money to family's caught in Bin Laden's shit\nThey screaming war, I'm like fuck it, go buy a battleship\nAnd bring it up that Mississipi, if you really wanna come than get me\nTell them niggas that a, don't tempt me\nCuz I'll squeeze them shits til' empty\nThrow shouts at nigga like frisbee\nWho the juice? How the hell you gonna pimp me?\nYou niggas must be kidding me, make an innocent nigga plead guilty\n\n[Hook x2]"}}, {"title": "Utha Side", "album": "Country Grammar", "year": "2000-06-27", "lyrics":

ride\nAnd let me take you to the other side\n\n[Verse 1]\nI said inhale, exhale\nI heard your clientele is doin' well\nI see you boomin' out the S-T-L\nPushin' a five hundred S-L\nI heard you even got a child now (look at that)\nA baby momma and a bow-wow\nMy nigga know you need to calm down\nF-for County run up in your house\nBut you don't wanna hear that though, it's too late\nNow the feds knocking at your door, you took the bait\nThey got taps on your mobile phone\nThey do surveillance all around your home\nNow ya pawnin' everything ya own\nCalling on your partners for a loan\nNo more slip and sliding on the chrome\nNow your good days have come and gone\nI tried to tell you\n\n[Chorus]\nI said you don't really wanna go, I can tell\nBut I'ma take you anyway, what the hell\nSo come

to the other side\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow baby girl, what's your name?\nAnd tell me what's your claim to fame\nOh, I can tell you do your thing\nJust by checking out your diamond ring\nI see you at the mall every day\nBuying Chanelle, Fendi, Donna K'\nPlus I heard they took your job away\nYa got ya kids' shit on layaway\nYou got a 4-5 Infinity (you livin' large)\nLike your last name was Kennedy (or El DeBarge)\nOh, I just can't believe\nThat you made that money righteously\nThe kids asking what they mommy do\nAnd why she lock us in the bedroom\nI think mommy getting paid to screw\n'Cause every night it's a different dude\nI tried to tell\n\n[Chorus]\nI said you don't really wanna go, I can tell\nBut I'ma take you anyway, what the hell\nSo come on get on in the ride\nAnd let me take you to the other side\nI said you don't really wanna go, I can tell\nBut I'ma take you anyway, what the hell\nSo come on get on in the ride\nAnd let me take you to the other side\n\n[Verse 3]\nLittle man how old are you (you can tell me)\nAnd what you doin' skippin' school?\nI see you running with your lil' crew\nOut here fightin' over red and blue\nSo now you wanna claim gangs\nEven heard you bought a thumper mayne, and that ain't it\nYou started out with chronic on the brain\nNow you're smokin' on amphetamines\nI ain't tryin' to sell your dreams, just trying to show you\nThat's it's other ways to getting cream (Take it from me)\nJust go to school and make somethin' of\nYour young life and watch it blow up\nAnd you ain't gotta stop bein' cool, and you ain't even gotta\nStop flossin' fancy jewels (and fast cars)\nJust keep it real with your game son\nAnd don't forget where you came from\nI'm tryin' to tell ya\n\n[Chorus]\nI said you don't really wanna go, I can tell\nBut I'ma take you anyway, what the hell\nSo come on get on in the ride\nAnd let me take you to the other side\nI said you don't really wanna go, I can tell\nBut I'ma take you anyway, what the hell\nSo come on get on in

you don't really wanna go, I can tell\nBut I'ma take you anyway, what the hell\nSo come on get on in the ride\nAnd let me take you to the other side\nI said you don't really wanna go, I can tell\nBut I'ma take you anyway, what the hell\nSo come on get on in the ride\nAnd let me take you to the other side\n\n[Verse 1]\nI said inhale, exhale\nI heard your clientele is doin' well\nI see you boomin' out the S-T-L\nPushin' a five hundred S-L\nI heard you even got a child now (look at that)\nA baby momma and a bow-wow\nMy nigga know you need to calm down\nF-for County run up in your house\nBut you don't wanna hear that though, it's too late\nNow the feds knocking at your door, you took the bait\nThey got taps on your mobile phone\nThey do surveillance all around your home\nNow ya pawnin' everything ya own\nCalling on your partners for a loan\nNo more slip and sliding on the chrome\nNow your good days have come and gone\nI tried to tell you\n\n[Chorus]\nI said you don't really wanna go, I can tell\nBut I'ma take you anyway, what the hell\nSo come on get on in the ride\nAnd let me take you to the other side\nI said you don't really wanna go, I can tell\nBut I'ma take you anyway, what the hell\nSo come on get on in the ride\nAnd let me take you to the other side\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow baby girl, what's your name?\nAnd tell me what's your claim to fame\nOh, I can tell you do your thing\nJust by checking out your diamond ring\nI see you at the mall every day\nBuying Chanelle, Fendi, Donna K'\nPlus I heard they took your job away\nYa got ya kids' shit on layaway\nYou got a 4-5 Infinity (you livin' large)\nLike your last name was Kennedy (or El DeBarge)\nOh, I just can't believe\nThat you made that money righteously\nThe kids asking what they mommy do\nAnd why she lock us in the bedroom\nI think mommy getting paid to screw\n'Cause every night it's a different dude\nI tried to tell\n\n[Chorus]\nI said you don't really wanna go, I can tell\nBut I'ma take you anyway, what the hell\nSo come on get on in the ride\nAnd let me take you to the other side\nI said you don't really wanna go, I can tell\nBut I'ma take you anyway, what the hell\nSo come on get on in the ride\nAnd let me take you to the other side\n\n[Verse 3]\nLittle man how old are you (you can tell me)\nAnd what you doin' skippin' school?\nI see you running with your lil' crew\nOut here fightin' over red and blue\nSo now you wanna claim gangs\nEven heard you bought a thumper mayne, and that ain't it\nYou started out with chronic on the brain\nNow you're smokin' on amphetamines\nI ain't tryin' to sell your dreams, just trying to show you\nThat's it's other ways to getting cream (Take it from me)\nJust go to school and make somethin' of\nYour young life and watch it blow up\nAnd you ain't gotta stop bein' cool, and you ain't even gotta\nStop flossin' fancy jewels (and fast cars)\nJust keep it real with your game son\nAnd don't forget where you came from\nI'm tryin' to tell ya\n\n[Chorus]\nI said you don't really wanna go, I can tell\nBut I'ma take you anyway, what the hell\nSo come on get on in the ride\nAnd let me take you to the other side\nI said you don't really wanna go, I can tell\nBut I'ma take you anyway, what the hell\nSo come on get on in the ride\nAnd let me take you to the other side\nI said you don't really wanna go, I can tell\nBut I'ma take you anyway, what the hell\nSo come on get on in the ride\nAnd let me take you to the other side\nI said you don't really wanna go, I can tell\nBut I'ma take you anyway, what the hell\nSo come on get on in

over but hold up, what is it over?\nSuicide, man that's the devil tryin to control us\nThey told us but we ain't notice the pain was sittin on they shoulders\nThe world is just too polar, they'd rather live in the solar\nSystem got us hopeless, they focus on foreclosures\nWake up and smell the Folgers\nObama bring home the soldiers\nOsama, you owe us, the 9/11 was bogus\nNow we right back at

stop\nYeah, livin life in the battlefield (battlefield)\nHmm, tryin to survive every day and every night is the same deal\nCause, life's strange (life's strange) time changes (time changes)\nBut karma always finds a way\nStay strong (stay strong) hold on (hold on)\nAnd don't let all your dreams fade away\n\n[Interlude: Nelly]\nYeah life can beat you down\nWhat goes, it comes around\nIt's not how

me lil' Derrty\nCan you herre me\nI herre you\n\n[Hook]\nShe said her name was Paradise\nThat's what she said to me\nShe said Paradise\nThat's what she said it would be\nCause she's\nThe finest women that I've ever did seen\nAnd not to mention how she looked in them jeans\nShe said her name was Paradise\nThat's what she said to me\nShe said Paradise\nThat's what she said it would be\nCause she was\nThe definition of a ghetto queen\nAnd you should see that apple bottom in jeans\n\n[Verse 1]\nI met her on a Sunday\nOne day she walkin down the runway\n5'5\", so fine\nWhat the fuck I'm 'gon say\nAnd I just sit there patiently\nJust wait and observe\nWaitin for my perfect chance so I can spit out my words\nI think she openly scopin me\nDamn I hope she notice me\nHopefully she'd go for me\nIf so she on the boat wit me\nAnd I'mma take her places she can never imagine\nLike waterskiin in Costa Rica\nSnowmobilin in Aspen\nDoes she prefer the cold of winter snow\nOr do she like it tropical\nAm I dreamin, let me know\nYou tell me is it possible\nThat I could be the one to end her search for a man\nAnd she could be my one to end my search for woman\nNo time to slack now\nAct now\nOoh I'm about to crack now\nI put my rap down, mack down\nAin't no turnin back now\nI got this feelin that she feelin the same\nAbout to end these feelin games\nAnd just ask her her name\n\n[Hook]\nShe said her name was Paradise\nThat's what she said to me\nShe said Paradise\nThat's what she said it would be\nCause she's\nThe finest women that I've ever did seen\nAnd not to

queen\nAnd you should see that apple bottom in jeans\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo the next day, on Monday\nI'm ridin down the freeway\nHit her on her 2Way\nI'm like watchu doin Tuesday\nShe said that she be free anytime after three\nAnd every second after that'll be reserved for me\nI said that's good to know\nThis ain't no mo'\n\"I'll be there around four\"\nAround fo' that fo' do'\nPhantom at your front door\nWe can take it for a ride\nKick it and conversate\nDebate or disfate\nDiner reservations at eight\nAnd after diner\nChampagne\nWalks along the beaches\nWhile that\nMoonlight\nShines and your features\nAnd I can't create the words\nTo explain my sudden nerves\nThe temptation to feel your body\nTemptation to kiss the curves\nStarted one kiss\nTwo kiss\nShe all on my neck and I\nGimme that three kiss\nFour kiss\nI'm all on her neck\nNow the, temperatures rise\nAnd them hips and thighs\nGot me hipnotized\nMan I don't wanna stop\n\n[Hook]\nIt feels like Paradise\nThat's what she said to me\nShe said Paradise\nThat's what she said it would be\nCause she's\nThe finest women that I've ever did seen\nAnd not to mention how she looked in them jeans\nShe said her name was Paradise\nThat's what she said to me\nShe said Paradise\nThat's what she said it would be\nCause she was\nThe definition of a ghetto queen\nAnd you should see that apple bottom in jeans\n\n[Bridge]\nThey don't understand me cuz\nI really don't understand it myself\nI can't live without\nMy girl\nParadise is mine mayne\nAnywhere or time mayne\nShe 'gon hold it down cuz she\nMy girl\nShe love me she love me not\nShe love me to be on top\nShe love daddy despite because she\nMy girl\nAnd if you got any doubts\nJust ask when you see me out\nI'll tell you who I'm talkin about\nMy girl\n\n[Hook] X2\nShe said

holding up their banners and running with their cameras\nCan I get a flick, you're damn right, miss\n\"Can I take a hit\", \"Here, boo, like this\"\nChronic's sticky like gum, I guess that's how it comes\nDon't worry 'bout my funds, I play around it in one\nWhen you've seen that Hummer but that was last summer\nThis year I'm more blunter, more up close and personal\nIt's just gon' get worse now, from Prada to Vokal\nThe Tics are too versatile, can't worry 'bout certain sounds\nThat come out these haters' mouths, I realize they can't help it\nJust stay where you're bowing down some more\nYou can't get these pounds, unless you gon' smoke it now\nIf not, I suggest you pack your shit up and head out of town\n\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Verse 2: Murphy Lee]\nThey be like, \"Hold up, hold up, hold up, I know that ain't them, man\"\nMurp jersey on backwards with old school Tim's\nAnd Kyjuan's got on so many colors just like a pimp\nNelly's chain's so long, got him walking with a limp\nAli is throwing money in the front row\nAnd her body's screaming slow down but where the hell is Slo of course\nWe be them up, close, live, and in person\nMight look like the type that be robbing them purses\nBut I ain't, I'm the young dude, I be rhyming them verses\nWorked hard since ninety-three, that's how I got signed to Universal\nNow the girlies take their thongs off\nAnd it be crazy in the club when that Lunatic song go off\nI be that 'pull up right beside you, beating bad' type of Tic\nI'm a 'hold up traffic to touch her ass' type of Tic\nLunatic, that's what I am, that's what I said I am\nI'm trying to be a millionaire, I bet I am, I bet I am\n\n[Verse 3: Kyjuan]\nIt's them boys' on them Porches in Air Forces reading Sources\nMy choice is old school's over them Rolls Royce's\nOf course, this Tic shit live like EA Sports is\nDribble in the club, I lay up with two draft choices\nHit the center, touch the point guard, she hit the joint hard\nOh, wee, oh Lord, she don't want no more\nCutlass is four door, stash for the four-four\nSmokes' one four-four's, what them oh's go for\nThree-fifty's one more, three-fifty stick in the floor\nBrand new Azure smashes, G's and C's all in my glasses\n'Tics fantastic, we get booked more than matches\nImagine me without them two headbands\nThem Vokal t-shirts with some eight class pants\nFeeling dapper like Dan, yes, fresh like Mannie\nCutlass candies sit down, you know you can't stand me\n\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Verse 4: Ali]\nBand Aids, Braids, Bald Heads, Fades, Locs\nStripey socks, rocks in the watch\nBig shorts (shorts), headband to a cross-jersey back Ross (Ross)\nThat's that mid-west talk, I think your future boss' Batter Up\nNo, cough, and let you know Caprice Classic's on these hoes\nFor big shows, tell her, best be on they toes\nFive Country Grammar boys in bandanas, platinum, no gold like oh\nThat's what they say when I pull up on d's in that old Dr J\nOld 88, fat laces, this world is rat races\nHeading back places but it still seems racist\nGot locations so I haul off the wall off if you could fall off\nGot a room at the Wada with a saw that'll take the wall off\nHit the mall off with a sag, hockey jersey, do rag\nFitted still, switching two different shoes, starchy with tags\n\nLike, oh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ee6c6181ebd522da5b345ff9cd0a61f9.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Nelly",

and then - Nelly to blame\nNow who you know come through first time on the scene\nNo set-ups, no guest appearances in between\nFire like a nigga drinkin gasoline\nI keep it hot, like my dirty down in New Orleans\nThe Rams won the Superbowl, bought myself a ring\nWhether you sparkle or you bling, don't matter same thing\nThug drinkin mo', but Don the King\nI'm gettin pissy, with Tissy, Missy and Irene\nReal close friends that like to try things\nMe and my dirties we like to buy things\nFuck around and give me a license to fly things\nLook up in the sky and have a Nelly sighting,

Oooh-wee!\n\n[Verse 2: Nelly]\nFirst name Nelly, last name Nel\nFirst letter C, last letter L\nSix hundred fly by, what the hell?\nV-12 full detail, sittin on Sprewell's\nWho in?  Can't tell, too much tint\nBut why the radio so loud?  Too much spent\nNever be a Bush man, too Bill Clint'\nBoth country boys, and if the head right, E.I\nHead for my residency, lovin my presidency\nI do it like you never did see\nShady to them niggas that's shadin me\nGivin back to the ones that gave to me\nBought a Caddy for the man that created me (who?)\nMy daddy, call him Big Nelly (ooh!)\nPimp juice flowin through that bloodline cuz\nHuh, see what it does?  Yeah, you feel the buzz, like\n\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Verse 3: Nelly]\nOne mo' time!  N, E, dash L-L-Y\nIf you didn't like me then, gon' hate me now\nMe and Murph' fogged out in the buggy I\nWith the, suction doors, two bad-ass whores\nHolla at Yo, cause I need that custom made\nWaves, fresh fade, brand new Band-Aid\nSkurrrt, them boys ain't playin around\nUnless it's her watch according to her face, hopscotch never\nNever tic-tac-toe, there's too many of those\nI need a Rocky Dennis face - uhh, know what I mean?\nThen I'm good to roll; hey, out of control\nNew motto - never fuck the same ho!\nTryin to catch Wilt, four more to go\nFrom the bed to the flo', jackrabbit too pro\nKnock 'em out, wake baby girl to let her know\nYo - you can't even stay here tonight, f'real, I'm sorry\n\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Nelly - still talking over Hook]\nY'know, cuz, my security they gon' be knockin on the door in a minute\nAnd, if you ain't out ma it's, it's it's gon' be violence\nUm, yeah, f'sure, nothin personal, fo'sho'\n\n[Interlude]\nUh uh, uh, you come ride with me\nUh, uh uh, uh you come ride with me\nSkurrrrrt!

Tell me shorty ain't the baddest\nTell me shorty don't deserve to walk the runway in Paris\n(Woo!) She deserve it all\nI don't do the mall, I do it by catalog\nLa Perla panties and bras, fuck buyin' at the bar\nI fuck around and buy this whole club by tomorrow\n... See, she's so nice\nShe can get whatever she likes\nDon't let the price make you mad\nI live a Fabolous life shorty, +Throw It in the Bag+\n\n[Hook]\n\n[T.I.]\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, go\n(She's so flyyyyyy)\nWhat?

such a hottie\nYo she's lookin over here but she won't get it out me y'all\nShake it off, that's how you play it off\nShake it off, that's how you play it off\nNot now, no you can't take it off\nBut play it off, she won't know a damn thing\n\n[Pharrell]\nI play it off 'til it's played out\nI had her motherfuckin ass on the couch, honey laid out\nShe hintin around at gettin ate out\nI know I'm spaced out (yeah) but the shit sound way out\n\n[Nelly]\nSo I had to take a playa out, switch up my whurrabouts\nCause she was tryin to turn a playa out\nAnd plus she know a nigga blazed out\nAnd lil' mama gon' crack a window, let the haze out\n\n[Pre-Hook: Pharrell]\nShe said she loves that stroke\nKeep on her heels and her coat\nThen she say she loves my moves\nAnd the way I do, what I do\nShe got that ba-da-buh-da\nGotta make, sure, I don't get attached\nThat ba-da-buh-da\nBut it keeps, on, bringin me back\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Pharrell]\nThe Sun sick a triflin, so sick he have ya snifflin\nPlus the chains like the nigga Slick Rick an' them\n\n[Nelly]\nWe had pick of them, strictly all dimensions and\nNot to mentionin the Benjamins is thickenin\n\n[Pharrell]\nAnd now it's like a odyssey when she sayin hi to me\nShe eat the dick, then she cry when she gotta leave\n\n[Nelly]\nBye, bye, you gotta go now (yeah)\nMy girl, just, pulled up outside\n\n[Pre-Hook]\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Pharrell]\nJust know the whole hood is lookin at you\nSo don't let your girl catch you\n\n[Nelly]\nSo have your story right, on how we met\nJust have your story right, and don't never forget\nYou need your story right, cause she'll be upset\nHer inner feelings'll be disrespect, but\n\n[Pre-Hook]\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Nelly]\nStory right\n(Just know the whole hood is lookin at you)\nStory right\n(So don't let your girl catch you)\nStory right.."}}, {"title": "Never Let 'Em C U Sweat", "album": "Country Grammar", "year": "2000-06-27", "lyrics": "[Intro: The Teamsters]\nYeah, gangsta\nWhat, that gangsta\nYeah, that

em see you sweat, yeah, that's my motto\nCatch 'em in the club get wrecked with the bottle\nThe silence all behind his neck, the others follow\nShow them you ain't bullshittin' and you ain't hollow\nI saw you talkin' to that chick up over there\nI heard you ask her why she is on my dick, yeah, yeah\nI heard it all before you dig, next thing you tellin' me Nelly\nI put that on my fuckin' kid, what you think this is?\nI'm the reason they invented the whole navigational system\nSo niggas can't find them trucks and they women when I'm with 'em\nLike I catch 'em in linen and then I flip 'em and run up in 'em\nSend her back to him and go to his house and blow him with her\n\n[Chorus: The Teamsters]\nI brought my Right Guard in case my shot ain't handy\nSpeed stickin' me and mine\nIf I turn it up

secret's still kept\nNever let 'em see you sweat\nI brought my Right Guard in case my shot ain't handy\nSpeed stickin' me and mine\nIf I turn it up a degree, the secret's still kept\nNever let 'em see you sweat\n\n[Verse 3: Nelly]\nWhat, sitting on the bricks of the river front in Cutlasses\nCheck the ashtray that hold the blunts, we hustling\nI do the push ups and the sit ups nigga, get muscular\nJust in case you let your lips slip up, I'm bustin' ya\nNever let em see you sweat, yeah, that's my motto\nCatch 'em in the club get wrecked with the bottle\nThe silence all behind his neck, the others follow\nShow them you ain't bullshittin' and you ain't hollow\nI saw you talkin' to that chick up over there\nI heard you ask her why she is on my dick, yeah, yeah\nI heard it all before you dig, next thing you tellin' me Nelly\nI put that on my fuckin' kid, what you think this is?\nI'm the reason they invented the whole navigational system\nSo niggas can't find them trucks and they women when I'm with 'em\nLike I catch 'em in linen and then I flip 'em and run up in 'em\nSend her back to him and go to his house and blow him with her\n\n[Chorus: The Teamsters]\nI brought my Right Guard in case my shot ain't handy\nSpeed stickin' me and mine\nIf I turn it up a degree, the secret's still kept\nNever let 'em see you sweat\nI brought my Right Guard in case my shot ain't handy\nSpeed stickin' me and mine\nIf I turn it up a degree, the secret's still kept\nNever let 'em see you sweat\n\n[Outro: The Teamsters]\nNever let 'em see you sweat\nNever let 'em see you
