breakfast with no hog\nI got my grub on, but didn't pig out\nFinally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out\nHooked it up for later as I hit the door\nThinkin', \"Will I live another 24?\"\nI gotta go

There was bad blood as a result between the group members. But when Eazy-E was dying due to complications of AIDS they decided to squash their beef with one another.

There was bad blood as a result between the group members. But when Eazy-E was dying due to complications of AIDS they decided to squash their beef with one another.

rap song\nHittin' all night long\nJust like me on the black and white ivory\nGettin' six on the tee-ta-lee, you don't want to see a G\nBreak yo' ass like dishes\nBuster-ass tricks, sleep with the fishes\nRunnin' from Lennox, up at Venice\nThey wanna have me in stripes, like Dennis the Menace\nBut that ain't poppin', ain't no stoppin'\nFo'-hoppin', ass droppin', Coupe DeVille\nMy troupe can, ill\u2014fool, I got skills\nSo, back on up 'fore I check that chin\nDown as fuck and I'm full off Henn'\nYou gets no love and I thought you knew it\nFool, you know how we do it\n\n[Refrain]\nComin' from the Westside\nComin' from the Westside\nWestside, comin' from the Westside\n\n[Verse 2: Ice Cube]\nChillin' with the homies, smellin' the bud\nDouble parked and I'm talkin' to Dub\nAbout who got a plan, who got a plot\nWho got got and who got shot\n'Cause everybody knows that he got the info\nCrazy Toones hangin' out the window\nFool, I got them bomb-ass tapes\nDa Lench Mob, \"Planet of the Apes\"\nI'm down with Eiht and Watts Up\nKam and Solo, they got nuts\nWhen Ice Cube write a sentence\nI want \"The Bomb,\" just like George Clinton\nS-K-D is down to catch a body\nPut on \"Knee Deep\", we'll turn out your party\nYou gets no love and I thought you knew it\nFool, you know how we do it\n\n[Refrain]\nYou know how we do it\n\n[Verse 3: Ice Cube]\nJack be nimble, and Jack be quick\nIf you wanna jack me on a lick\n'Cause I'm that fool from South Central\nYou'll think you stuck yourself with a number two pencil\nThat's how I poke hot lead in yo' ass\nWith \"Mo' Bounce to the Ounce\" in the dash\nMash up, Van Ness, headed for the West\nEverything is great, slow down for the dip\nOn 100 and 8th and keep mashin'\nDon't drink and drive, to keep the fo' from crashin'\nStashin' a Glock and I thought you knew it\nYou know how we do it\n\n[Refrain]\nComin' from the Westside, Westside\nNothin' but the Westside\nIt's hittin' on the Westside\nFool, you know how

it\nWestside\nComin' from the Westside\nNothin' but the Westside\n\n[Verse 1: Ice Cube]\nAin't nothin' goin' on but the bomb-ass rap song\nHittin' all night long\nJust like me on the black and white ivory\nGettin' six on the tee-ta-lee, you don't want to see a G\nBreak yo' ass like dishes\nBuster-ass tricks, sleep with the fishes\nRunnin' from Lennox, up at Venice\nThey wanna have me in stripes, like Dennis the Menace\nBut that ain't poppin', ain't no stoppin'\nFo'-hoppin', ass droppin', Coupe DeVille\nMy troupe can, ill\u2014fool, I got skills\nSo, back on up 'fore I check that chin\nDown as fuck and I'm full off Henn'\nYou gets no love and I thought you knew it\nFool, you know how we do it\n\n[Refrain]\nComin' from the Westside\nComin' from the Westside\nWestside, comin' from the Westside\n\n[Verse 2: Ice Cube]\nChillin' with the homies, smellin' the bud\nDouble parked and I'm talkin' to Dub\nAbout who got a plan, who got a plot\nWho got got and who got shot\n'Cause everybody knows that he got the info\nCrazy Toones hangin' out the window\nFool, I got them bomb-ass tapes\nDa Lench Mob, \"Planet of the Apes\"\nI'm down with Eiht and Watts Up\nKam and Solo, they got nuts\nWhen Ice Cube write a sentence\nI want \"The Bomb,\" just like George Clinton\nS-K-D is down to catch a body\nPut on \"Knee Deep\", we'll turn out your party\nYou gets no love and I thought you knew it\nFool, you know how we do it\n\n[Refrain]\nYou know how we do it\n\n[Verse 3: Ice Cube]\nJack be nimble, and Jack be quick\nIf you wanna jack me on a lick\n'Cause I'm that fool from South Central\nYou'll think you stuck yourself with a number two pencil\nThat's how I poke hot lead in yo' ass\nWith \"Mo' Bounce to the Ounce\" in the dash\nMash up, Van Ness, headed for the West\nEverything is great, slow down for the dip\nOn 100 and 8th and keep mashin'\nDon't drink and drive, to keep the fo' from crashin'\nStashin' a Glock and I thought you knew it\nYou know how we do it\n\n[Refrain]\nComin' from the Westside, Westside\nNothin' but the Westside\nIt's hittin' on the Westside\nFool, you know how we do it"}}, {"title": "The Nigga Ya Love to Hate", "album":

get down, it's all about coming up\nSo what they do, go and ban the AK?\nMy shit wasn't registered any fucking way\nSo you better duck away, run and hide out\nWhen I'm rolling real slow and the lights out\n'Cause I'm about to fuck up the program\nShooting out the window of a drop-top Brougham\nWhen I'm shooting, let's see who drop\nThe police, the media, and suckers that went pop?\nAnd motherfuckers that say they too black\nPut 'em overseas, they be begging to come back\nAnd say we promote gangs and drugs\nYou wanna sweep a nigga like me up under the rug\nKicking shit called street knowledge\nWhy more niggas in the pen than in college?\nBecause of that line, I might be your cellmate\nThat's from the nigga ya love to hate\n\n[Hook]\n(Fuck you Ice Cube!)\nYeah, haha! It\u2019s the nigga you love to hate\n(Fuck you Ice Cube!)\n(Ay yo baby, your mother warned you about me)\nIt's the nigga you love to hate\n(Yo, you ain\u2019t doin' nothin' positive!\nYo, you ain\u2019t doin' nothin 'positive for the brothers, what you gotta say for yourself?)\n(You don't like how I'm living? Well, fuck you)\n\n[Verse 2: Ice Cube]\nOnce again it's on, the motherfucking psycho\nIce Cube the bitch-killer, cap-peeler\nYo, running through the line like Bo, there's no pot to piss in\nI put my fist in\nNow, who do ya love to hate?\nCause I talk shit and down the eight-ball 'cause I don't fake\nYou're begging I fall off\nThe crossover, might as well cut them balls off\nAnd get your ass ready for the Lenching\nThe Mob is dropping common sense and\nWe'll gank in the pen, we'll shank\nAny Tom, Dick and Hank, and get the ass spanked\nIt ain't about how right or wrong you live, but how long you live\nI ain't with the bullshit\nI meet mo' bitches, mo' hoes\nDon't wanna sleep, so I keep popping No-Doz\nAnd tell the young people what they gotta know\n'Cause I hate when niggas gotta live low\nAnd if you're locked up I dedicate my stylin'\nFrom San Quentin to Rikers Island\nWe got 'em afraid of the funky shit\nI like to clown so pump up the sound\nIn your Jeep, make the old ladies say\n\"Oh my god \u2014 break, it's the nigga ya love to hate\"\n\n[Hook]\n(Fuck you Ice Cube)\nYeah come on fool, it\u2019s the nigga you love to hate\n(Fuck you Ice Cube)\nYeah, what up, punk? It\u2019s the nigga you love to hate\n[Yo, who the fuck you think you are callin' us bitches. You ain\u2019t all that, all I hear is this bitch. I ain\u2019t nobody\u2019s bitch]\nA bitch is a...ohhhh\n\n[Verse 3: Ice Cube]\nSoul Train done lost they soul\nJust call it train cause the bitches look like hoes\nI see a lotta others damn\nIt almost look like the Bandstand\nYou ask me: \"did I like Arsenio?\"\nAbout as much as the Bicentennial\nI don't give a fuck about dissing these fools\n'Cause they all scared of the Ice Cube\nAnd what I say, what I portray and all that\nAnd ain't even seen the gat\nI don't wanna see no dancing\nI'm sick of that shit -- listen to the hit\n'Cause yo if I look and see another brother\nOn the video trying to out-dance each other\nI'ma tell T-Bone to pass the bottle\nAnd don't give me that shit about role model\nIt ain't wise to chastise and preach\nJust open the eyes of each\n'Cause laws are made to be broken up\nWhat niggas need to do is start loc-ing up\nAnd build mold and fold theyself into shape\nOf the nigga you love to hate", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1cb382d2d9fb4a9bfa94e3074c1aa220.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Ice Cube", "raw": {"annotation_count": 18, "api_path": "/songs/239", "apple_music_id": "1005221538", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/239/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "Ice Cube\u2019s classic (and often-borrowed; see here and here) polemical theme: you love to hate him!

nigga\nThat's why I'm sick of getting treated like a goddamn stepchild\nFuck a punk, 'cause I ain't him\nYou gotta deal with the nine-double-M\nThe day is coming that you'll all hate\nJust think if niggas decide to retaliate\nThey try to keep me from running up\nI never tell you to get down, it's all about coming up\nSo what they do, go and ban the AK?\nMy shit wasn't registered any fucking way\nSo you better duck away, run and hide out\nWhen I'm rolling real slow and the lights out\n'Cause I'm about to fuck up the program\nShooting out the window of a drop-top Brougham\nWhen I'm shooting, let's see who drop\nThe police, the media, and suckers that went pop?\nAnd motherfuckers that say they too black\nPut 'em overseas, they be begging to come back\nAnd say we promote gangs and drugs\nYou wanna sweep a nigga like me up under the rug\nKicking shit called street knowledge\nWhy more niggas in the pen than in college?\nBecause of that line, I might be your cellmate\nThat's from the nigga ya love to hate\n\n[Hook]\n(Fuck you Ice Cube!)\nYeah, haha! It\u2019s the nigga you love to hate\n(Fuck you Ice Cube!)\n(Ay yo baby, your mother warned you about me)\nIt's the nigga you love to hate\n(Yo, you ain\u2019t doin' nothin' positive!\nYo, you ain\u2019t doin' nothin 'positive for the brothers, what you gotta say for yourself?)\n(You don't like how I'm living? Well, fuck you)\n\n[Verse 2: Ice Cube]\nOnce again it's on, the motherfucking psycho\nIce Cube the bitch-killer, cap-peeler\nYo, running through the line like Bo, there's no pot to piss in\nI put my fist in\nNow, who do ya love to hate?\nCause I talk shit and down the eight-ball 'cause I don't fake\nYou're begging I fall off\nThe crossover, might as well cut them balls off\nAnd get your ass ready for the Lenching\nThe Mob is dropping common sense and\nWe'll gank in the pen, we'll shank\nAny Tom, Dick and Hank, and get the ass spanked\nIt ain't about how right or wrong you live, but how long you live\nI ain't with the bullshit\nI meet mo' bitches, mo' hoes\nDon't wanna sleep, so I keep popping No-Doz\nAnd tell the young people what they gotta know\n'Cause I hate when niggas gotta live low\nAnd if you're locked up I dedicate my stylin'\nFrom San Quentin to Rikers Island\nWe got 'em afraid of the funky shit\nI like to clown so pump up the sound\nIn your Jeep, make the old ladies say\n\"Oh my god \u2014 break, it's the nigga ya love to hate\"\n\n[Hook]\n(Fuck you Ice Cube)\nYeah come on fool, it\u2019s the nigga you love to hate\n(Fuck you Ice Cube)\nYeah, what up, punk? It\u2019s the nigga you love to hate\n[Yo, who the fuck you think you are callin' us bitches. You ain\u2019t all that, all I hear is this bitch. I ain\u2019t nobody\u2019s bitch]\nA bitch is a...ohhhh\n\n[Verse 3: Ice Cube]\nSoul Train done lost they soul\nJust call it train cause the bitches look like hoes\nI see a lotta others damn\nIt almost look like the Bandstand\nYou ask me: \"did I like Arsenio?\"\nAbout as much as the Bicentennial\nI don't give a fuck about dissing these fools\n'Cause they all scared of the Ice Cube\nAnd what I say, what I portray and all that\nAnd ain't even seen the gat\nI don't wanna see no dancing\nI'm sick of that shit -- listen to the hit\n'Cause yo if I look and see another brother\nOn the video trying to out-dance each other\nI'ma tell T-Bone to pass the bottle\nAnd don't give me that shit about role model\nIt ain't wise to chastise and preach\nJust open the eyes of each\n'Cause laws are made to be broken up\nWhat niggas need to do is start loc-ing up\nAnd build mold and fold theyself into shape\nOf the nigga you love to hate"}}, {"title": "Why We Thugs", "album": "Laugh Now, Cry

Where is your sympathy?\nBad cop, where's your humanity?\nGood cop, is that just a fantasy?\nHell on that nigga, snitch on that bitch\nTruth be told, mothafuck the blue code\nFuck the po-po actin' like Deebo\nAlready know Craig'll let the brick go\nBlack Lives Matter is not chit chatter\n'Cause all they wanna do, is scatter brain matter\nA mind is a terrible thing to waste\nA nine is terrible in your face\nThe mace has a terrible fuckin' taste\nThe pen is a terrible fuckin' place\nThe kings all hate the fuckin' ace\nThe judge sabotaged my fuckin' case\nRacist motherfucker\n\n[Outro]\nBlack police showin' out for the white cop\nWhite police showin' out for the black cop", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9c575bc84cfc0134a9b73a19085d9ce6.600x600x1.jpg", "artist": "Ice Cube", "raw": {"annotation_count": 16, "api_path": "/songs/3114590", "apple_music_id": "1444774099", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/3114590/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "\u201cGood Cop Bad Cop\u201d is one of three new Ice Cube tracks released on the 25th anniversary re-release edition of Death Certificate.

Don't even try cop\nAin't no mothafuckin' drugs up in my spot\nAll you find in my closet is the high tops\nAnd my mothafuckin' tickets to the skybox\nHold up, nigga, I'm a rider\nYou's a roll-up, yep the controller\nMake me mad that's when I get swole up (Don't touch me)\nThe Incredible Hulk is bipolar\nCome out the cuffs knock off the rust\nThrow my hands (What's up?) up you still wanna bust\nThe Trojan horse is full of excessive force\nWhen they try to get aggressive nigga off the porch (C'mon)\n\n[Chorus]\nBlack police showin' out for the white cop\nWhite police showin' out for the black cop\nBlack police showin' out for the white cop\nWhite police showin' out for the black cop\n\n[Verse 3]\nGood cop, good cop, where is your dignity?\nWhere's your empathy? Where is your sympathy?\nBad cop, where's your humanity?\nGood cop, is that just a fantasy?\nHell on that nigga, snitch on that bitch\nTruth be told, mothafuck the blue code\nFuck the po-po actin' like Deebo\nAlready know Craig'll let the brick go\nBlack Lives Matter is not chit chatter\n'Cause all they wanna do, is scatter brain matter\nA mind is a terrible thing to waste\nA nine is terrible in your face\nThe mace has a terrible fuckin' taste\nThe pen is a terrible fuckin' place\nThe kings all hate the fuckin' ace\nThe judge sabotaged my fuckin' case\nRacist motherfucker\n\n[Outro]\nBlack police showin' out for the white cop\nWhite police showin' out for the black cop"}}, {"title": "Nobody Wants to Die", "album": null, "year": "2016-10-06", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nEverybody wants to go to Heaven\nY'all thought I was soft as cotton\nEverybody wants to go to Heaven\nMessed around and forgot I was rotten\nEverybody wants to go to Heaven\nYou know my resume\nYou tell 'em I'm on my way\nBut nobody (You tell 'em, I'm on my way)\nAh nobody wants to die\n\n[Verse 1]\nI keep my mind on my money, I keep my hand on my gunny\nDon't get to playin' with sonny, unless you Playboy Bunny\nI'll put four in your tummy, tap two in your brain\nSee the man ain't playing, if you think it's a game\nHaters whisper my name, suckers want what I slang\nArrogant and I'm vain, DA want me to hang\nBut let me explain, like Abel and Cain\nThat the black Grim Reaper is not my brother's keeper\nRevenge, revenge a killer's on a binge of revenge\nIt depends if I can live with my sins\nLose family and friends (lost em all)\nNow you got to lose life and limb, spit phlegm on them\nGot the code of Rakim, homey, jokes ain't allowed\nAnd you boy ain't scared to move the crowd with something loud\nIf you doubt what I'm about, go ahead an run your mouth\nI'm the last thing you see when your time is running out, trick\n\n[Hook]\nEverybody wants to go to Heaven\nI'll send you fast boy, with a blast boy (first class, boy)\nEverybody wants to go to Heaven\nMessin' with the wrong one, send you on that long run\nEverybody wants to go to Heaven (I ain't the one, son)\nPop you like a pro, now you good to go (yeah)\nBut nobody (Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody)\nAh nobody wants to die\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou forgot where I come from, you forgot what I do\nYou forgot what you was sayin', cuz I'm blockin' your view\nNow I got you on cue, you about to turn blue\nGet around me now you actin' like my little nephew\nBoy what you wan' do?

Heaven\nYou know my resume\nYou tell 'em I'm on my way\nBut nobody (You tell 'em, I'm on my way)\nAh nobody wants to die\n\n[Verse 1]\nI keep my mind on my money, I keep my hand on my gunny\nDon't get to playin' with sonny, unless you Playboy Bunny\nI'll put four in your tummy, tap two in your brain\nSee the man ain't playing, if you think it's a game\nHaters whisper my name, suckers want what I slang\nArrogant and I'm vain, DA want me to hang\nBut let me explain, like Abel and Cain\nThat the black Grim Reaper is not my brother's keeper\nRevenge, revenge a killer's on a binge of revenge\nIt depends if I can live with my sins\nLose family and friends (lost em all)\nNow you got to lose life and limb, spit phlegm on them\nGot the code of Rakim, homey, jokes ain't allowed\nAnd you boy ain't scared to move the crowd with something loud\nIf you doubt what I'm about, go ahead an run your mouth\nI'm the last thing you see when your time is running out, trick\n\n[Hook]\nEverybody wants to go to Heaven\nI'll send you fast boy, with a blast boy (first class, boy)\nEverybody wants to go to Heaven\nMessin' with the wrong one, send you on that long run\nEverybody wants to go to Heaven (I ain't the one, son)\nPop you like a pro, now you good to go (yeah)\nBut nobody (Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody)\nAh nobody wants to die\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou forgot where I come from, you forgot what I do\nYou forgot what you was sayin', cuz I'm blockin' your view\nNow I got you on cue, you about to turn blue\nGet around me now you actin' like my little nephew\nBoy what you wan' do? You ain't gon' do ish\nBut go take a ish, is 'bout as funky as it get\nNow I'ma have to admit, that I was prolly too nice\nBut take my advice or I'll take your life\nNow if you still wanna slice, let's start with the fingers\nLet's move to the toes, and end with the penis\nSee men are from Mars, now you from Venus\nHow dumb you got to be tryin' to think with the genius\nIt's the big payback, you can't clown James Brown\nSee a brother been down ever since Jamestown\nYou either swim or you're drowned, you either gagged or you're bound\nNow you can't make a sound, boy look at you now\n\n[Hook]\nEverybody wants to go to Heaven\nI'll send you fast boy, with a blast boy (first class, boy)\nEverybody wants to go to Heaven\nMessin' with the wrong one, send you on that long run\nEverybody wants to go to Heaven (I ain't the one, Crip)\nPop you like a pro, now you good to go (Go on)\nBut nobody (Nobody, na)\nAh nobody wants to die"}}, {"title": "Arrest The President", "album": "Everythang's Corrupt", "year": "2018-11-09", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nYeah\nWhen I drop the mic it hit the floor like Thor (That's right)\nYou can't pick it up no more (Don't even try)\nY'all know what it is, y'all know what it was (Yeah)\nY'all know what it shall be\n\n[Verse 1]\nGet smart 'fore the shit start\n'Fore it get dark, 'fore they hit you with the pitchfork\nBetter crip walk (Crip walk), this is real talk\nSmoke kush and bush, then we peel off (Eugh)\nNiggas still rollin' with the wheels off (Eugh)\nAlways lookin' out for the crisscross\nI'm a bigger boss than Rick Ross\nAlways winnin', nigga, get lost\nIt's the warlord, bring the voodoo\nWhen I bail through, it's crazy like Bellevue\nWhat they tell you?

if I drink this Hen'\nEverybody will know it\nCause I ain't going for it\nSo pray to the Lord that I don't pull out\nCuss out and bust out\nGo the nigga route\nMake the trigger shout, uh\nYou can try

recruiting\nNigga 6-8 whooping\nI was in the hood shooting cause I had the wife whooping\nI come from padres gold in oversized jars\nI past up strife and got star awards\nNo time for playa hating, Mack paper chasing\nCame out the substation to the hip hop nation\nThe mo' hits the mo' bigga with illegal weight figga\nDone develop the status of a platinum plus nigga\nBust the first asshole to show I can hit it\nI keep pushing, don't quit it\nDon't stop till I get it\n\n[Ms. Toi] (Ice Cube)\nDon't stop get it, get it\n(That's real)\nDon't stop nigga hit it\n(I will)\n[Ice Cube]\nI'm gon' do

streets\nBumpin' BlackSTREET, treated like a athlete\nLife ain't a track meet (no) it's a marathon\nFuck the cemetery that a nigga get buried on\n\"We be clubbing\" till the day we die\nNigga ask the bartender if you think we lie\nBut if you think we high, nigga think again\nCause when it's sink or swim\nYou got to think to win\nAnd if I drink this Hen'\nEverybody will know it\nCause I ain't going for it\nSo pray to the Lord that I don't pull out\nCuss out and bust out\nGo the nigga route\nMake the trigger shout, uh\nYou can try to smoke an ounce to this\nWhile I pronounce this shit\nBaby bounce them tits\nMama move them hips\nBaby shake them cheeks\nI got dick for days\nYou got ass for weeks, yeah, yeah\n\n[Ms. Toi] (Ice Cube)\nDon't stop get it, get it\n(That's real)\nDon't stop

whooping\nI come from padres gold in oversized jars\nI past up strife and got star awards\nNo time for playa hating, Mack paper chasing\nCame out the substation to the hip hop nation\nThe mo' hits the

up, man\n(Who is this)\nThe Don Mega, nigga, who you think\n(Ey, homie, what happened)\nMy whole life flashed before my eyes, man\n\n[Verse 1]\nLife...\nNiggas used to come and get me\nWhen it was time to disagree with an enemy\nPass the Hennessy it gives me energy\nPacked the gat in the small of my back\nWhere these niggas at, I'll clear the whole pack\nTalking shit cause I'm down for my set\nI'm a vet, smoking on a wet cigarette\nWho these niggas think they are\nWishing on a ghetto star, I represent my tar\nI start busting and they scatter like water bugs\nCause these Westside niggas is harder thugs\nEnslave us but nothing can save us from sporting Ben Davis\nShootin' at your neighbors\nCause sometimes I feel like a nut\nDon\u2019t give a fuck when I open you up\nHot rocks\nFly from the back seat\nAnd busta-ass niggas run like a track meet\nAnd if you caught in the middle\nBleed more than a little (what)\nKiller King is the hospital\nFeeling numb from the bullets I hum\nAnd when they hit\nBlack mothers have fits\nI don\u2019t give a shit\n\n[Chorus]\nFool I'm a vet you can bet\nThat I could dance underwater and not get wet\nCheck it\nIt's raining bullets and I'm still there\nI'm still there\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy house shoes get wet from the dew on the grass\nUp early in the morning taking out the trash\nFeeling like a loser, alcohol abuser\nTwo youngsters roll up on a beach cruiser\nOne on the peddles, the other on the handle bars\nTryna be ghetto stars\nThey said, \"are you from the Westside is it so?\"\nI said, \"hell yeah and who want to know?\"\nMe\nIn slow mo\u2019, .44 slugs, face down in the mud\nPuddle full of blood\nLeft for dead, the pain starts to spread\nNow I can\u2019t feel my legs\nI meet Doctor Who at King Drew medical center\nAs I enter I.C.U\nHe said the bullet hit a nerve that was vital\nI said I can\u2019t move my legs, he said don\u2019t try to\nNow this ain\u2019t the end my friend but you'll probably never walk again\nI sit there motionless holding this pain inside contemplating suicide\nAt night I jerk and jerk\nBut my dick don\u2019t work it don\u2019t even hurt\nNow who'd ever thought a nigga rude as Ice Cube\nA'be pissing through a tube\nFool I'm a vet\n\n[Chorus]\nFool, I'm a vet you can bet\nI can dance underwater and not get wet (check it)\nIt\u2019s raining bullets and I'm still there\nYoung ghetto nigga in a wheelchair\n\n[Verse 3]\nFuck a V-A they need G-A\nGang Hospital for a cripple\nNow I'm drinking Ripple\nSame corner, same hood I'm still there\nWith bandanas tied to my wheel chair\nTo all the hood rat hoes I'm fired\nThey mad cause my tongue get tired\nNow everybody want to put they dope on me\nSayin I won't get searched by the LAPD\nI'm sittin' in a doorway deuce-five\nDepending on that to keep my ass alive\nI don\u2019t got bows but my arm's about a one-six\nWith fucking legs looking like tooth picks\nSome times I can\u2019t deal\nGot to beg the BG's to roll me up the hill\nPut me on the porch\nNow I'm on the torch\nSmoking cocaine\nJust to maintain\nNothing to gain nothing to lose\nAnd last night I couldn\u2019t make it to the bathroom\nFeeling like a 2-year-old\nYou can\u2019t get a sip from the brew I hold\nIt\u2019s the only friend to a stranger\nAKA: handicapped gangbanger\nThere's a lot in my life I regret becoming a ghetto vet\nFool I'm a Vet\n\n[Chorus]\nFool I'm a vet you can bet\nThat I could dance underwater and not get wet\nCheck it\nIt's raining bullets and I'm still there\nI'm still there\n\nDedicated to all the ghetto vets\nFor every nigga that done took

this)\nThe Don Mega, nigga, who you think\n(Ey, homie, what happened)\nMy whole life flashed before my eyes, man\n\n[Verse 1]\nLife...\nNiggas used to come and get me\nWhen it was time to disagree with an enemy\nPass the Hennessy it gives me energy\nPacked the gat in the small of my back\nWhere these niggas at, I'll clear the whole pack\nTalking shit cause I'm down for my set\nI'm a vet, smoking on a wet cigarette\nWho these niggas think they are\nWishing on a ghetto star, I represent my tar\nI start busting and they scatter like water bugs\nCause these Westside niggas is harder thugs\nEnslave us but nothing can save us from sporting Ben Davis\nShootin' at your neighbors\nCause sometimes I feel like a nut\nDon\u2019t give a fuck when I open you up\nHot rocks\nFly from the back seat\nAnd busta-ass niggas run like a track meet\nAnd if you caught in the middle\nBleed more than a little (what)\nKiller King is the hospital\nFeeling numb from the bullets I hum\nAnd when they hit\nBlack mothers have fits\nI don\u2019t give a shit\n\n[Chorus]\nFool I'm a vet you can bet\nThat I could dance underwater and not get wet\nCheck it\nIt's raining bullets and I'm still there\nI'm still there\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy house shoes get wet from the dew on the grass\nUp early in the morning taking out the trash\nFeeling like a loser, alcohol abuser\nTwo youngsters roll up on a beach cruiser\nOne on the peddles, the other on the handle bars\nTryna be ghetto stars\nThey said, \"are you from the Westside is it so?\"\nI said, \"hell yeah and who want to know?\"\nMe\nIn slow mo\u2019, .44 slugs, face down in the mud\nPuddle full of blood\nLeft for dead, the pain starts to spread\nNow I can\u2019t feel my legs\nI meet Doctor Who at King Drew medical center\nAs I enter I.C.U\nHe said the bullet hit a nerve that was vital\nI said I can\u2019t move my legs, he said don\u2019t try to\nNow this ain\u2019t the end my friend but you'll probably never walk again\nI sit there motionless holding this pain inside contemplating suicide\nAt night I jerk and jerk\nBut my dick don\u2019t work it don\u2019t even hurt\nNow who'd ever thought a nigga rude as Ice Cube\nA'be pissing through a tube\nFool I'm a vet\n\n[Chorus]\nFool, I'm a vet you can bet\nI can dance underwater and not get wet (check it)\nIt\u2019s raining bullets and I'm still there\nYoung ghetto nigga in a wheelchair\n\n[Verse 3]\nFuck a V-A they need G-A\nGang Hospital for a cripple\nNow I'm drinking Ripple\nSame corner, same hood I'm still there\nWith bandanas tied to my wheel chair\nTo all the hood rat hoes I'm fired\nThey mad cause my tongue get tired\nNow everybody want to put they dope on me\nSayin I won't get searched by the LAPD\nI'm sittin' in a doorway deuce-five\nDepending on that to keep my ass alive\nI don\u2019t got bows but my arm's about a one-six\nWith fucking legs looking like tooth picks\nSome times I can\u2019t deal\nGot to beg the BG's to roll me up the hill\nPut me on the porch\nNow I'm on the torch\nSmoking cocaine\nJust to maintain\nNothing to gain nothing to lose\nAnd last night I couldn\u2019t make it to the bathroom\nFeeling like a 2-year-old\nYou can\u2019t get a sip from the brew I hold\nIt\u2019s the only friend to a stranger\nAKA: handicapped gangbanger\nThere's a lot in my life I regret becoming a ghetto vet\nFool I'm a Vet\n\n[Chorus]\nFool I'm a vet you can bet\nThat I could dance underwater and not get wet\nCheck it\nIt's raining bullets and I'm still there\nI'm still there\n\nDedicated to all the ghetto vets\nFor every nigga that done took one for the hood"}}, {"title": "Everythang's Corrupt", "album": "Everythang's Corrupt", "year": "2013-01-04", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nEverythang's corrupt, everythang's fucked up\nEverythang's 'bout a

my preacher turned to prostitution\nThe prosecution never read my files\nThat evil ass judge fell asleep at my trial\nThis shit is wild, chickens get as sick as the cows\nBirds fallin out the sky,

booger came out\nIts a shame, I used to be on top of my game\nThey took the shirt off my back and replaced it with chains\nI met Mr. Lee Harvey, from the tea party\nHe used to hate Obama til' he felt

shit out of luck\n\n[Verse 1]\nGo to school, the teacher wanna fuck the students\nGo to church, my preacher turned to prostitution\nThe prosecution never read my files\nThat evil ass judge fell asleep at my trial\nThis shit is wild, chickens get as sick as the cows\nBirds fallin out the sky, fish dyin' in piles\nIts fishy, politicians smell like my bowels\nTalkin' that shit, really crampin' my styles\nI got many, now I'm pinchin' pennies no doubt\nI squeezed Lincoln so hard, a fuckin' booger came out\nIts a shame, I used to be on top of my game\nThey took the shirt off my back and replaced it with chains\nI met Mr. Lee Harvey, from the tea party\nHe used to hate Obama til' he felt hurricane Charley\nLooking for his FEMA check, it's gone with the wind\nWhen em' dicks is in, you know the fix is in\n\n[Chorus]\nFor my birthday, buy me a politician\nIt's a shame that you got to teach yo' children\nEverythang's corrupt, everythang's fucked up\nEverythang's 'bout a buck, we shit out of luck\nFor my birthday, buy me a politician\nIt's a shame that you got to teach yo' children\nEverythang's corrupt, everythang's fucked up\nEverythang's 'bout a buck, we shit out of luck\n\n[Verse 2]\nEverythang's a scam, beat the next man\nThat's capitalism, they'll just build a new prison\nFor you slick ass niggas' that's tryin' to beat the system\nPut you on the front line if you ain't re-enlisting\nIt's hot in hell's kitchen, get ready for the lynching\nBrain-wash media, and puppet politician\nKeep you out of position, out of commission\nBy medicine or food, that's not a decision\nThe 99 percent, is man tryin' to vent\nPolice grab my fuckin' arm, then they got bent\nNow it's in a splint, I can't pay my rent\nThe interest on my credit card I ain't made a dent\nThe U.S mint, I heard they bout' to print\nBut it's fucked up cause' I won't see a cent\nI'm sick of gettin' ignored, this world I can't afford\nI'm going to the pen, free room, free board, bitch\n\n[Chorus]\nFor my birthday, buy me a politician\nIt's a shame that you got to teach yo' children\nEverythang's corrupt, everythang's fucked up\nEverythang's 'bout a buck, we shit out of luck\nFor my birthday, buy me a politician\nIt's a shame that you got to teach yo' children\nEverythang's corrupt, everythang's fucked up\nEverythang's 'bout a buck, we shit out of luck\n\n[Outro]\nIt's ball of confusion, my niggas they losin'\nI know what ya doin', they drug abusin'\nMy bitches be choosin', my Uzi be oozin'\nThe thugs be cruisin', they know what you're doin'\nIt's ball of confusion, my niggas they losin'\nI know what ya doin', they drug abusin'\nMy bitches be choosin', my Uzi be oozin'\nThe thugs be cruisin', they know what you're doin'"}},

the city of the criminal zone\nOne-time can't keep the law in order\n'Cause everybody's goin' crazy for a quarter\nYou're tuned in to the number one crew in the area\nThe way I'm talkin' I'm scarin' ya\nI'm darin' ya to raise hell and bail and brag and sag\nOr beat down for ya flag\n'Cause if you is or you ain't a gangbanger\nKeep one in the chamber\n'Cause you'll get them thangs put on ya son\nIce Cube has got the 4-1-1\nAll the ol' school house fellows are crooks\nSo I get jealous looks\nThey keep thinkin' did my head grow?\nWill the boys in the hood have to beat down Ice Cube?\nHell no, I'll static son, you'll see it's okay\nI keep my nine anyway\nFor the day one of my homies wanna squab\nI'm still rollin' wit Da Lench Mob\n\n[Bridge]\n(America's Most Wanted)\n\n[Verse 2: Ice Cube]\nBack in the day I did my share of dirt\nSometimes I got away clean, sometimes people got hurt\nBut if you know me, you know that I'm liable\nTo bust a cap 'cause it's all about survival of the fittest\nI'm a menace crook\nI did so much dirt, I need to be in the Guinness Book\nFrom the shit I took from people\nI repo your Vette, then jet\nBack to the criminal set\nI leave clue after clue, but they can't catch me yet\n'Cause I'm slick as slippery\nThey can't get with me, cops ain't shit to me\nI can't dig a pig, so I drop the dogs\nAnd sweat em like sweathogs\nAnd get mad, mad 'cause I'm the nigga that flaunt it\nAmeriKKKa's Most Wanted\n\n[Verse 3: Ice Cube]\nAiyo, here's what the poster read\n\"Ice Cube is wanted dead\"\nThat's all it said\nI put heads to bed and fled the scene wit all the green\nHear shots and si-reens\nWhen I fiend, first they yo' rings, now they my rings\nSo give it up punk and then I just\nPut another jack in progress\nIt's the American way\n'Cause I'm the G-A-N-G-S-T-A\nIce Cube, a motherfuckin' klepto\nAnd tried to catch the early bird but they slept, so\nWho gets the worm?\nAnd if I'm caught in a trap, wou know I'ma beat the wack\nWith a payoff, cop gotta lay off\nFBI on my dick, stay off!\nI'm not a rebel or a renegade on a quest\nI'm a nigga with a 'S' on his chest\nSo get the Kryptonite 'cause I'm a rip tonight\n'Cause I'm scarin' ya, wanted by America\n\n[Interlude]\n(Aiyo Cube man, they on your ass)\n\n[Verse 4: Ice Cube]\nWord, but who the fuck is Herb?\nIt's time to take a trip to the suburbs\nLet 'em see a nigga invasion\nPoint blank on a Caucasian\nCocked the hammer, didn't crack no smile\nTake me to your house, pal\nGot to the house, my pockets got fat, see\nCrack the safe, got the money and the jewelry\nThree weeks later, I'm at the P-A-D\nHad a little fly ass bitch wit me\nSittin' in the den, yo it couldn't be\n(What up, G?) Saw my face on TV\nDamn (oh shit!) I didn't know I lucked out\nStruck out, I gotta get the fuck out\nPacked my bags and tried to hit the door when\nThe ol' bitch down the street must've turned me in\nCos the feds was out there ten deep\nI got hassled and gaffled in the back seat\nI think back when I was robbin' my own kind\nThe police didn't pay it no mind\nBut when I start robbing the white folks\nNow I'm in the pen with the soap-on-a-rope\nI said it before and I'll still taught it\nEvery motherfucker with a color is most wanted\n\n[Outro]\nAmeriKKKa's Most Wanted, uh,  reports that Ice Cube is the leader of the, uh, Lench Mob. Uh, also in the group they have J-Dee, Chill, T-Bone, Yo-Yo, Del, K-Dee\nSounds like a black thing", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ad9591d1ec30bd6ec342549cbe68949c.630x630x1.jpg", "artist": "Ice

livin' in the city of the criminal zone\nOne-time can't keep the law in order\n'Cause everybody's goin' crazy for a quarter\nYou're tuned in to the number one crew in the area\nThe way I'm talkin' I'm scarin' ya\nI'm darin' ya to raise hell and bail and brag and sag\nOr beat down for ya flag\n'Cause if you is or you ain't a gangbanger\nKeep one in the chamber\n'Cause you'll get them thangs put on ya son\nIce Cube has got the 4-1-1\nAll the ol' school house fellows are crooks\nSo I get jealous looks\nThey keep thinkin' did my head grow?\nWill the boys in the hood have to beat down Ice Cube?\nHell no, I'll static son, you'll see it's okay\nI keep my nine anyway\nFor the day one of my homies wanna squab\nI'm still rollin' wit Da Lench Mob\n\n[Bridge]\n(America's Most Wanted)\n\n[Verse 2: Ice Cube]\nBack in the day I did my share of dirt\nSometimes I got away clean, sometimes people got hurt\nBut if you know me, you know that I'm liable\nTo bust a cap 'cause it's all about survival of the fittest\nI'm a menace crook\nI did so much dirt, I need to be in the Guinness Book\nFrom the shit I took from people\nI repo your Vette, then jet\nBack to the criminal set\nI leave clue after clue, but they can't catch me yet\n'Cause I'm slick as slippery\nThey can't get with me, cops ain't shit to me\nI can't dig a pig, so I drop the dogs\nAnd sweat em like sweathogs\nAnd get mad, mad 'cause I'm the nigga that flaunt it\nAmeriKKKa's Most Wanted\n\n[Verse 3: Ice Cube]\nAiyo, here's what the poster read\n\"Ice Cube is wanted dead\"\nThat's all it said\nI put heads to bed and fled the scene wit all the green\nHear shots and si-reens\nWhen I fiend, first they yo' rings, now they my rings\nSo give it up punk and then I just\nPut another jack in progress\nIt's the American way\n'Cause I'm the G-A-N-G-S-T-A\nIce Cube, a motherfuckin' klepto\nAnd tried to catch the early bird but they slept, so\nWho gets the worm?\nAnd if I'm caught in a trap, wou know I'ma beat the wack\nWith a payoff, cop gotta lay off\nFBI on my dick, stay off!\nI'm not a rebel or a renegade on a quest\nI'm a nigga with a 'S' on his chest\nSo get the Kryptonite 'cause I'm a rip tonight\n'Cause I'm scarin' ya, wanted by America\n\n[Interlude]\n(Aiyo Cube man, they on your ass)\n\n[Verse 4: Ice Cube]\nWord, but who the fuck is Herb?\nIt's time to take a trip to the suburbs\nLet 'em see a nigga invasion\nPoint blank on a Caucasian\nCocked the hammer, didn't crack no smile\nTake me to your house, pal\nGot to the house, my pockets got fat, see\nCrack the safe, got the money and the jewelry\nThree weeks later, I'm at the P-A-D\nHad a little fly ass bitch wit me\nSittin' in the den, yo it couldn't be\n(What up, G?) Saw my face on TV\nDamn (oh shit!) I didn't know I lucked out\nStruck out, I gotta get the fuck out\nPacked my bags and tried to hit the door when\nThe ol' bitch down the street must've turned me in\nCos the feds was out there ten deep\nI got hassled and gaffled in the back seat\nI think back when I was robbin' my own kind\nThe police didn't pay it no mind\nBut when I start robbing the white folks\nNow I'm in the pen with the soap-on-a-rope\nI said it before and I'll still taught it\nEvery motherfucker with a color is most wanted\n\n[Outro]\nAmeriKKKa's Most Wanted, uh,  reports that Ice Cube is the leader of the, uh, Lench Mob. Uh, also in the group they have J-Dee, Chill, T-Bone, Yo-Yo, Del, K-Dee\nSounds like a black thing"}}, {"title": "Steady Mobbin'", "album": "Death Certificate", "year": "1991-08-09", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nGod damn!\nThe bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin'\nAnd when dealin' wit' Da Lench Mob you gots to know steady mobbin' is not just the name of this jam, but a way of life\nBound together by motherfuckers as known to break em' off something\nGive it to me\n\n[Sample] (x4)\n\"There goes the neighborhood\"\n\"There goes the neighborhood\"\n\"There goes the neighborhood\"\n\"There goes the neighborhood\"\n\n[Verse 1: Ice Cube]\nFour or five niggas in a mothership\nBetter known as a deuce and we all wanna smother shit\nBent, front and back glass got tint\nTryin' to get our hands on some dollars and cents\nAnd fools can't hold us\nEvery chance we get, we hittin' up the rollers\nComin' up short of the green guys\nAnd I might start slangin' bean pies\nOr the bootleg t-shirt of the month\nWith \"U Can't Touch This\" on the front\nI'm 'bout to get rich\nCause life ain't nuttin but money and fuck a bitch\nThey drop like dominoes\nAnd if you didn't know, Ice Cube got drama hoes\nSo after the screwin'\nI bust a nut and get up and put on my white Ewings\nI'm out the door\nAll you might get is a rubber on the floor\nCause I'm ready to hit the road like Mario Andretti\nBitch, cause I'm steady mobbin'\n\n[Hook]\n(\"Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?\") (Steady mobbin')\nHave you ever seen such a sight in your life?\n(Steady mobbin')\n\n[Verse 2: Ice Cube]\nBustin' caps in the mix\nRather be judged by twelve than carried by six\nCause I'm gettin' major\nFuck Pactel, move to Sky Pager\nTold all my friends:\nDon't drink 8 Ball, cause St. Ide's is givin ends\nFools get drunk and wanna compete\nSlapboxin in the street\nNiggas get mad, tempers are flarin'\nCause they got a few bitches starin'\nJust for the nappy heads\nBut scandalous bitches, make for happy Feds\nI make it my duty to cuss 'em\nOut, cause I just don't trust em\nAnd if you tell on me I'm bombin' on Betty\nBitch shoulda known I was steady mobbin'\n\n[Hook]\nHave you ever seen such a sight in your life?\n(Steady mobbin')\nHave you ever seen such a sight in your life?\n\n[Verse 3: Ice Cube]\nSince one-time so hot\nGot me a stash spot in my hooptie for the Glock\n'Cause I'm rollin' on rims\nEating soul food, neckbones from M&M's\nGrubbin' like a motherfucker\nGreasy-ass lips, now I gots to take a shit\nSaw Sir Jinx bailin'\nWhen I hit a left on Ruthelen, \"Whattup loc?\"\nDon't you know that niggas get smoked\nThey take they life for a joke, get in nigga\nI'll take you to the pad soon\nWent to mom's house and dropped a load in the bathroom\nJumped back in my low rider\nComin' out feelin' about ten pounds lighter\nWent to Bone's house so I can get the gat\nLooking for the place where all the hoes kick it at\nLench Mob ain't nuttin but tramps\nBut hoes lickin' nuts like stamps\nOne fool bumpin' music for the yamps\nBut Ice Cube had more amps, get in bitch\nCause I had the jam on\nAnd I don't want to hear shit about a tampon\nGive me the nappy and make me happy\nThe ho said 'Pappy could you slap me\nOn the ass hard and fast\nAnd could please try not to leave a gash?'\nI said yeah, but I don't play sex\nWithout puttin' on the latex\nSlipped on the condom\nFucked around and dropped the bomb son\nAnd it came out sort of like confetti\nIn for the night, no longer steady mobbin'\n\n[Hook]\nHave you ever seen such a sight in your life?\n(Steady mobbin')\nHave you ever seen such a sight in your life?\nHave you ever seen such a sight in your life?\n(Steady mobbin')\nHave you ever seen such a sight in your life?", "image":

life\nBound together by motherfuckers as known to break em' off something\nGive it to me\n\n[Sample] (x4)\n\"There goes the neighborhood\"\n\"There goes the neighborhood\"\n\"There goes the neighborhood\"\n\"There goes the neighborhood\"\n\n[Verse 1: Ice Cube]\nFour or five niggas in a mothership\nBetter known as a deuce and we all wanna smother shit\nBent, front and back glass got tint\nTryin' to get our hands on some dollars and cents\nAnd fools can't hold us\nEvery chance we get, we hittin' up the rollers\nComin' up short of the green guys\nAnd I might start slangin' bean pies\nOr the bootleg t-shirt of the month\nWith \"U Can't Touch This\" on the front\nI'm 'bout to get rich\nCause life ain't nuttin but money and fuck a bitch\nThey drop like dominoes\nAnd if you didn't know, Ice Cube got drama hoes\nSo after the screwin'\nI bust a nut and get up and put on my white Ewings\nI'm out the door\nAll you might get is a rubber on the floor\nCause I'm ready to hit the road like Mario Andretti\nBitch, cause I'm steady mobbin'\n\n[Hook]\n(\"Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?\") (Steady mobbin')\nHave you ever seen such a sight in your life?\n(Steady mobbin')\n\n[Verse 2: Ice Cube]\nBustin' caps in the mix\nRather be judged by twelve than carried by six\nCause I'm gettin' major\nFuck Pactel, move to Sky Pager\nTold all my friends:\nDon't drink 8 Ball, cause St. Ide's is givin ends\nFools get drunk and wanna compete\nSlapboxin in the street\nNiggas get mad, tempers are flarin'\nCause they got a few bitches starin'\nJust for the nappy heads\nBut scandalous bitches, make for happy Feds\nI make it my duty to cuss 'em\nOut, cause I just don't trust em\nAnd if you tell on me I'm bombin' on Betty\nBitch shoulda known I was steady mobbin'\n\n[Hook]\nHave you ever seen such a sight in your life?\n(Steady mobbin')\nHave you ever seen such a sight in your life?\n\n[Verse 3: Ice Cube]\nSince one-time so hot\nGot me a stash spot in my hooptie for the Glock\n'Cause I'm rollin' on rims\nEating soul food, neckbones from M&M's\nGrubbin' like a motherfucker\nGreasy-ass lips, now I gots to take a shit\nSaw Sir Jinx bailin'\nWhen I hit a left on Ruthelen, \"Whattup loc?\"\nDon't you know that niggas get smoked\nThey take they life for a joke, get in nigga\nI'll take you to the pad soon\nWent to mom's house and dropped a load in the bathroom\nJumped back in my low rider\nComin' out feelin' about ten pounds lighter\nWent to Bone's house so I can get the gat\nLooking for the place where all the hoes kick it at\nLench Mob ain't nuttin but tramps\nBut hoes lickin' nuts like stamps\nOne fool bumpin' music for the yamps\nBut Ice Cube had more amps, get in bitch\nCause I had the jam on\nAnd I don't want to hear shit about a tampon\nGive me the nappy and make me happy\nThe ho said 'Pappy could you slap me\nOn the ass hard and fast\nAnd could please try not to leave a gash?'\nI said yeah, but I don't play sex\nWithout puttin' on the latex\nSlipped on the condom\nFucked around and dropped the bomb son\nAnd it came out sort of like confetti\nIn for the night, no longer steady mobbin'\n\n[Hook]\nHave you ever seen such a sight in your life?\n(Steady mobbin')\nHave you ever seen such a sight in your life?\nHave you ever seen such a sight in your life?\n(Steady mobbin')\nHave you ever seen such a sight in your

preaching to the choir\nWhen I'm in this pulpit I might catch some fire\nGlass full of gas, do you got a lighter?\nHand full of ass, why should I retire\nThe shit I spit might inspire the messiah\nTo throw these lives in a lake full of fire\nAin't nothing flier than my fuckin' rims and my tires\nAnd a word to the wise, you better fuckin' recognize\nThat I been on the block since bitches did the wop\nSince Floyd and Damien kept rocks in they socks, nigga\nTaught 2Pac how to keep it gangsta\nI showed Biggie Smalls how to release his anger\nWho came before me?

clown\nCause everytime that the pigs have got me\nY'all rub it in with the flying Nazi\nMilitary force, but we don't want ya\nStandin' on my roof with the rocket launcher\n\"So fly like an

chopper with numbers on the bottom\n\"Calling all cars, I think we've got em.\"\nI hit the gas and I mashed past Inglewood\nI think I drove through every single hood\nSouth Central, Compton and Watts\nLong Beach, bust a U, here come the cops\nWish I had a genie with about three wishes\nMetal flake green on D's I look suspicious\nYou know that I'm running\nShit, I hear it humming\nFuck, I see it coming\nIs it a bird? Yup\nIs it a plane? No\nI hit me a right on El Segundo\nWanted to holla, had to ditch the Impala\nLet's see if they would folla\nMe, hit a fence, hit a fence, and another\nMet me a baby pitbull and his mother\nRan up in some peoples house and looked out of the window\nI wish it was my kinfolk\nHad to pull a strap on a fool named Louis the Third\nCuz I'm getting chased by the ghetto bird\n\n\"Just put his hat, ehrrr, he combed his hair and then put his hat back\nOn. Errr, he's acting nonchalant up there in that cockpit, going 115\nMiles an hour, with the police chasing him. Ehm, they're not gonna be\nReal happy when they catch up with him, no matter what, the eh\nEhrr, they hate, they hate a bigmouth even worse.\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nOfficer Bird's on his way, and I don't wanna see him\nCould you please give me the keys to the B.M.?\nSee, I didn't want to gank you\nBut don't make me bank you, thank you\nTried to get yo the hood, and you might guess\nThat a fool like me done shot Cyrus\nIncognito, Ghetto Eagle\nSaying, \"Fuck, where did he go?\"\nI bust me a left on Ruthelen. Park\nThe 735 and I'm bailin\nWent to my homegirl's house and got a hug man\nShe helped me run like Harriet Tubman\nLooked out the window by the black bed\nI saw the pigs and the four on a flatbed\nThen the light from the bird hit me in the face\nI close the blinds cause I didn't wanna catch a case\nAll that night, I heard the bird circle\nWhile I was eating fish and watching Urkel\nShe said I could sleep on the couch\nBy two A.M. I was digging her out\nFuck the ghetto bird\n\n\"Which way is he going now?\"\n\"Ok, now..now he's..he's actually southbound..on a service street\nAnd, uh...Gee whiz, uh, I'm gonna get my maps out here and figure\nOut which service srteet he suddelny turned off on. Uh, the sherriffs\nAre..are...well I know that...Sherriffs ground units got thrown off\"\n\nMotherfuck you and your punk-ass ghetto bird"}}, {"title": "Drop Girl", "album": null, "year": "2014-01-01",

Vivid storytelling, powerful message, and haunting production. Its arc is:\n\n\nThe difficulties of hustling in a big city\nTraveling somewhere smaller to hustle (what we assume will the summer vacation)\nInitial success\nNew difficulties\nA grim ending (revealed to be the actual summer vacation)\n\n\n\nNotice that like so many other Ice Cube tracks, it\u2019s narrated through a persona. In tracks like \u201cAlive On Arrival\u201d and \u201cOnce Upon the Time in the Projects\u201d, Cube\u2019s character is an innocent type who tries to stay out of trouble but gets caught up in it. Here, he plays the exact type of character who would be an antagonist in either of those songs.\n\nThe cumulative effect of these personas is that Cube exposes the listener to a wide swath of experiences. We see many segments of society and varying perspectives\u2014yet they\u2019re all united by common themes. All three of those songs are strongly anti-hustling, for instance. As Ice Cube has said in a few interviews, for a story to be about dealing drugs, it\u2019s not realistic if it doesn\u2019t have a tragic ending. If the ending\u2019s happy, it ended too soon.

"body": {"plain": "Underrated Ice Cube track! Vivid storytelling, powerful message, and haunting production. Its arc is:\n\n\nThe difficulties of hustling in a big city\nTraveling somewhere smaller to hustle (what we assume will the summer vacation)\nInitial success\nNew difficulties\nA grim ending (revealed to be the actual summer vacation)\n\n\n\nNotice that like so many other Ice Cube tracks, it\u2019s narrated through a persona. In tracks like \u201cAlive On Arrival\u201d and \u201cOnce Upon the Time in the Projects\u201d, Cube\u2019s character is an innocent type who tries to stay out of trouble but gets caught up in it. Here, he plays the exact type of character who would be an antagonist in either of those songs.\n\nThe cumulative effect of these personas is that Cube exposes the listener to a wide swath of experiences. We see many segments of society and varying perspectives\u2014yet they\u2019re all united by common themes. All three of those songs are strongly anti-hustling, for instance. As Ice Cube has said in a few interviews, for a story to be about dealing drugs, it\u2019s not realistic if it doesn\u2019t have a tragic ending. If the ending\u2019s happy, it ended too soon. (For a similar rumination on this topic, see Ice-T\u2019s \u201cPain\u201d.)"}, "comment_count": 0, "community": true, "custom_preview": null, "has_voters": true, "id": 3513213, "pinned": false,

Man I ain't lettin my damn daughter go out with no damn Ice Cubes man! Man what the hell you talkin' about man? I brought my daughter up man in a Catholic school, private school. Man what you want with her? I'm sick of this bullshit!\n[Cube] Yo man, let me tell you somethin':\n\n[Verse One - Ice Cube]\nYour daughter was a nice girl, now she is a slut\nA queen treatin' niggas just like King Tut\nGobblin up nuts, sorta like a hummingbird\nSuckin up the Lench Mob crew, and I'm comin' third\nUsed to get straight A's, now she just skippin' class\nOh my, do I like to grip the hips and ass\nOnly seventeen, with a lot of practice\nOn black boys jimmies and white boys cactus\nSorry sorry sir, but I gotta be brief\nA lotta niggas like bustin' nuts in her teeth\nDrink it up, drink it up, even though she's Catholic\nThat don't mean shit, cause she's givin' up the ass quick\nQuicker than you can say, \"Candy,\"\nThe bitch is on my Snicker... and oh man she\nCan take on three men - built like He-Men\nHer little-bitty twat got gallons of semen\nFourteen niggas in line ready to bang your\nPride-and-joy, I mean daddy's little angel\nTell the little bitch to bring her ass out the house\nCause your daughter's known, for givin' up the nappy dug out\n\n[Hook 2X]\n\n\"I got a big old ding-a-ling, and if that bitch can hang\nI'm gonna do my thing, with your dauuuughter!\"\n[Sample] Givin up the nappy dug out!\n\n[Interlude - \"Pops\"]\n\n[\"Pops\"]\nLook motherfucker you better get from in front of my house with that old god damn bullshit, you curly-haired motherfucker. You better get out of here witcho' fine ass. Man, youse a little fine motherfucker\n\n[Verse Two - Ice Cube]\nMister, mister, before you make me go\nI'm here to let you know your little girl is a ho\nNympho, nympho, boy is she bad\nGet her all alone and out comes the kneepads\nI know she is a minor and it is illegal\nBut the bitch is worse than Vanessa Del Rio\nAnd if you decide to call rape\nWe got the little hooker on tape, now:\nTell the fuckin' slut to please hurry up\nAnd wear that dress that's tight on her butt\nSo I can finger-fuck on the way to the bed\nBeen in so many rooms, she got a dot on her forehead\nFace turnin' red from grabbin' them ankles\nFuck and get up is how I do them stank-hoes\nYou should hear how she sounds with a cock in her\nBoots get knocked, from here to Czechoslovakia\nTwo are on top, one on the bottom\nFirst nigga got the boots; man, you shoulda shot him\nCause after I got 'em it was over\nNow niggas get lucky like a four-leaf clover\nOn daddy's little girl\nShe keeps nuts in her mouth like the bitch was a squirrel\nSo tell Cheryl to bring her ass home\nCause the line at my house is gettin loooooooong, ay!\n\n[Hook 2x]\n\n\"I got a big old ding-a-ling, and if that bitch can hang\nI'm gonna do my thing, with your dauuuughter!\"\n[Cube] Yeah.. yeah.. bitch, bitch givin up the nappy dug out!\n\"I got a big old ding-a-ling, and if that bitch can hang\nI'm gonna do my thing, with your

dug out..\"\n[Girl]\nMercy!\n\n[Outro - A Singing Condom]\nWarning: when having sexual intercourse with a female like Cheryl\nYou must use, jimmy hat condoms\n\nWe're called jimmy hats, have you ever seen us?\nMost guys wear us round rolled up on your penis\nIf you're real smart, you will always use us\nPut me in your wallet, 'cause some dummies lose us screws us\nAnd goin bare back, without the bare facts\n'll have creepy crawlers crawlin on your nutsac!\nSo get the J-I-M-M-Y to the hats\nIt's me and two brothers in a pack\n\n\"Run out and get your jimmy hats..\" [KRS-One]\n\"Small, and

ain't no pop cause that sucks\nAnd you can New Jack SWING on my nuts\nDown wit the niggas that I bail out\nI'm platinum bitch and I didn't have to sell out\n\"Fuck you, Ice Cube!\", that's what the people say\nFuck AmeriKKKa, still with the triple K\nCause you know when my nine goes buck\nIt'll bust your head like a watermelon dropped from 12 stories up\nNow let's see who'll drop\nPunk motherfuckers tryin' to ban hip-hop\nFuck R&B and the runnin' man\nI'm the one that stand, with the gun in hand\nMake sure before you buck wit duck quick\nPunk, cause I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with\n\n\"I'ma let y'all know one thing man..\"\n\n[Verse 2: Ice Cube]\nHell yeah it's on, you better tell 'em\nIce Cube and I'm rolling with the motherfuckin L.M\nIt's the number one crew in the area\nMake a move for your gat and I'll bury ya\nAshes to ashes, dirt to dirt\nPunks roll when I put in work\nCause Lench Mob niggas are the craziest\nAnd y'all motherfuckers can't fade my shit\nSouth Central, that's where the Lench Mob dwell\nHittin fools up with the big ass L\nOne time can't hold me back\nSweatshirt, khakis and crokersacs\nStop givin' juice to the Raiders\nCause Al Davis never

roll on\nEven bitches looking like En Vogue gotta \"Hold On\"\nDon't let me catch Daryl Gates in traffic\nI gotta have it, to peel his cap backwards\nI hope he wear a vest too, and his best blue\nGoin up against the Zulu\nBreak his spine like a jellyfish\nKick his ass til I'm smellin shit\nOff wit the head, off wit the head I say\nAnd watch the devil start kickin'\nRun around like a chicken\nGrand Dragon finger lickin'\nYo, turn him over wit a spatula\nNow we got, Kentucky Fried Cracker\nMess with the Cube, you get punked quick\nPig, cause I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with!\n\n\"Last person in

Cube is out-gunned, what is the outcome?\nWill they do me like Malcolm?\n'Cause I bust styles, new styles, standin' - strong!\nWhile, others +Run+ a +Hundred Miles+\nBut I never run, never will\nDeal with the devil with my motherfuckin' steel - BOOM!\nMedia tried to do me\nBut I was a Boy-N-the-Hood before the movie, yeah\nCall me nigga, bigot and a spook\nBut you the one that voted for Duke, motherfucker\nWhite man, is somethin' I tried to study\nBut I got my hands bloody, yeah\nThey said I could sing like a jaybird\nBut nigga, don't say the J-word\nI thought they was buggin'\n'Cause to us Uncle Sam, is Hitler without an oven\nBurnin' our black skin\nBuy my neighborhood - then push the crack in\nDoin' us wrong from the first day\nAnd don't understand why a nigga got an AK\nCallin' me an African-American\nLike everything is fair again, shit\nDevil, you got to get the shit right, I'm black\nBlacker than a trillion midnights\n+Don't Believe the Hype+ was said in '88\nBy the great Chuck D, now they're tryin' to fuck me\n\"...with +No Vaseline+\nJust a match and a little bit of gasoline\"\u2014HUH!\nIt's a great day for genocide (What's that?)\nThat's the day all the niggas died\nThey killed JFK in '63\nSo what the fuck you think they'll do to me?\nBut I'm the O.G. and I bust back (boom boom)\nBust back (Boom boom!) peel a cap (BOOM BOOM!)\nGimme room in the fire of the sun\nHere the mack come, here the black come, watch Jack run!\nMotherfuckers can't gank me\nFuck a devil, fuck a rebel, and a yankee\nOverrun, and put the Presidency\nAfter needin that, I'm down wit O.P.P., yeah\nI met Farrakhan and had dinner\nNow you ask if I'm a Five Percenter\u2014well...\nNo, but I go where the brothers go\nDown with Compton Mosque, Number 54\nMade a little dough, still got a sister on my elbow\nDid Ice Cube sell out? You say, \"Hell no!\"\nA black woman is my manager, not in the kitchen\nSo could you please stop bitchin'?\n\n[Hook]\n\"Stalkin', walkin' in my big black boots\" \u2014 Brother J\n[Cube] Yeah, yeah...\n\"But when will they shoot?\"\n\"Stalkin', walkin' in my big black boots\" \u2014 Brother J\n[Cube] Yeah, yeah...\n\"But when will they shoot?\"\n(*automatic gunfire*)\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou missed, and didn't hit Da Lench Mob either\n(Guerillas in the Mist) without Jungle Fever\nBut I got the fever for the flavor of a cracker\nNot a Pringle, bust the single, here's my new jingle\n(\"Stalkin', walkin' in my big black boots\")\nThe KKK has got three-piece suits\nUsing niggas like turkey shoots\nMy motto is +Treat 'Em Like a Prostitute+\nNow if I say no violence, devil, you won't respect mine\nFuck the dumb shit,  and get my Tec-9\nAnd if they approach us\nI... I... I bury those cockroaches\nAnd if you can't deal with my +Kill at Will+\nHere's a new gift to get, try my +Death Certificate+\n+Amerikkka's Most+, Amerikkka's burnt, it's like toast\nLike Jordan, I'm goin' coast to coast\nDribblin' the funk\nHere comes the nigga with the motherfuckin' monster dunk\nGet off me, punk!\n\"Jordan...\" \"Watch Jordan\nAyo, Cube, watch Jordan...\" \"YES!\"\n\"You better eat your Wheaties\" \u2014 Michael Jordan\n\n[Hook]\n\"Stalkin', walkin' in my big black boots\" \u2014 Brother J\n[Cube] Yeah, yeah...\n\"But when will they shoot?\"\n\"Stalkin', walkin' in my big black boots\" \u2014 Brother J\n[Cube] Yeah, yeah...\n\"But when will they shoot?\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nDaryl Gates got the studio surrounded\n'Cause he don't like the niggas that I'm down with\nMotherfucker wanna do us\n'Cause I like Nat, Huey, Malcolm, and Louis\nMost got done by a black man's bullet\nGive a trigger to a nigga and watch him pull it\nNegro assassin\nI'mma dig a ditch, bitch, and throw yo' ass in\nWhen they shoot, no, it won't be a cracker\nThey use somebody much blacker\nWhat I do? I called up the Geto Boy(s) crew\n'Cause +My Mind's Playing Tricks On Me+ too\nNever died, surround my crib\nAnd F.O.I. makin' sure nobody creep when I sleep\nKeep a 9 millimeter in my Jeep - PEEP!\nWhen I roll, I gots to roll deep\nAin't goin out cheap\nMet the MADD Circle on Cypress Hill 'cause it's so steep\nThey'll never get me, they'll never hit me\nMotherfuck that shit, J-Dee\nNow I'm relaxed\nGrab the St. Ide's brew so I can max\nSittin' by the window 'cause it's so fuckin' hot\nAnd then I heard a shot - boom"}}, {"title": "Drink The Kool-Aid", "album": "I Am the West", "year": "2010-07-27", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThis ain't Sinatra!\nThis ain't the Carter!\nI am the chaperone nigga...Who brought ya!\nI am the author!

Yeah, you that motherfucker that betrayed your homeboys and you ain't shit! Yeah, you about to get your motherfucking ghetto pass revoked, motherfucker. Punk-ass mark, bitch-made. Punk-ass trick in a basket... You got caught up in the mix\n\n[Verse 1]\nIt's the nigga, ya love to hate, with a new song\nSo what really goes on?\nNothing but a come-up, but ain't that a bitch\nThey hate to see a young nigga rich\nBut I refuse to switch even though\nCause I can't move to the snow\nCause soon as y'all get some dough\nYa wanna put a white bitch on your elbow\nMoving out your neighborhood\nBut I walk through the ghetto, and the flavor's good\nLittle kids jumping on me\nBut you, you wanna be white and corny\nLiving way out\n\"Nigga go home\", spray-painted on your house\nTrying to be white or a Jew\nBut ask yourself, who are they to be equal to?\nGet the hell out\nStop being, a Uncle Tom, you little sell-out\nHouse nigga scum\nGive something back to the place where you made it from\nBefore you end up broke\nFuck around, and get your ghetto pass revoked\nI ain't saying no names, you know who you are you little punk\nBe true to the game\n\n[Break]\nYeah, motherfucker. Yeah, you thought we forgot, huh? Yeah, get a little money and moves out the neighborhood and shit. But you still ain't shit\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen you first start rhyming it started off slow, and then you start climbing\nBut it wasn't fast enough I guess, so you gave your other style a test\nYou was hardcore hip-hop\nNow look at yourself, boy you done flip-flopped\nGiving our music away to the mainstream\nDon't you know they ain't down with the team?\nThey just sent they boss over\nPut a bug in your ear, and now ya crossed over\nOn MTV, but they don't care\nThey'll have a new nigga next year\nYa out in the cold\nNo more white fans, and no more soul\nAnd you might have a heart attack\nWhen you find out the black folks don't want you back\nAnd you know what's worse?\nYou was just like the nigga in the first verse\nStop sellin' out ya race\nAnd wipe that stupid-ass smile off your face\nNiggas always gotta show they teeth\nNow I'ma be brief, be true to the game\n\n[Break]\nYeah motherfucker, I see you got your fancy cars and shit, but you know what? You still ain't shit. That's right, I caught you slipping. You know I could've gat you, yeah, but I didn't even trip\n\n[Verse 3]\nA message to the Oreo cookie\nFind a mirror, and take a look, G\nDo you like what you see?\nBut you're quick to point the finger at me\nYou wanna be the big fish, you little guppy\nBlack man can't be no yuppie\nYou put on your suit and tie, and your big clothes\nYou don't associate with the Negroes\nYou wanna be just like Jack\nBut Jack, is calling you a nigga behind your back\nSo back off genius\nI don't need you to correct my broken English\nYou know that's right\nYou ain't white\nSo stop holding your ass tight\nCause you can't pass\nSo why you keep trying to pass?\nWith your black ass\nMister Big\nBut in reality, you're shorter than a midge\nYou only got yourself to blame\nGet a grip, Oreo, and be true to the game\n\n[Outro: Ice Cube and Leesa Gibbons]\nAnd Ice Cube practices what he preaches. He continues to live in South Central Los Angeles, and he puts his money into projects that improve the neighborhood\nBe true to the game!", "image":

You know who I'm talking to. Yeah, you that motherfucker that betrayed your homeboys and you ain't shit! Yeah, you about to get your motherfucking ghetto pass revoked, motherfucker. Punk-ass mark, bitch-made. Punk-ass trick in a basket... You got caught up in the mix\n\n[Verse 1]\nIt's the nigga, ya love to hate, with a new song\nSo what really goes on?\nNothing but a come-up, but ain't that a bitch\nThey hate to see a young nigga rich\nBut I refuse to switch even though\nCause I can't move to the snow\nCause soon as y'all get some dough\nYa wanna put a white bitch on your elbow\nMoving out your neighborhood\nBut I walk through the ghetto, and the flavor's good\nLittle kids jumping on me\nBut you, you wanna be white and corny\nLiving way out\n\"Nigga go home\", spray-painted on your house\nTrying to be white or a Jew\nBut ask yourself, who are they to be equal to?\nGet the hell out\nStop being, a Uncle Tom, you little sell-out\nHouse nigga scum\nGive something back to the place where you made it from\nBefore you end up broke\nFuck around, and get your ghetto pass revoked\nI ain't saying no names, you know who you are you little punk\nBe true to the game\n\n[Break]\nYeah, motherfucker. Yeah, you thought we forgot, huh? Yeah, get a little money and moves out the neighborhood and shit. But you still ain't shit\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen you first start rhyming it started off slow, and then you start climbing\nBut it wasn't fast enough I guess, so you gave your other style a test\nYou was hardcore hip-hop\nNow look at yourself, boy you done flip-flopped\nGiving our music away to the mainstream\nDon't you know they ain't down with the team?\nThey just sent they boss over\nPut a bug in your ear, and now ya crossed over\nOn MTV, but they don't care\nThey'll have a new nigga next year\nYa out in the cold\nNo more white fans, and no more soul\nAnd you might have a heart attack\nWhen you find out the black folks don't want you back\nAnd you know what's worse?\nYou was just like the nigga in the first verse\nStop sellin' out ya race\nAnd wipe that stupid-ass smile off your face\nNiggas always gotta show they teeth\nNow I'ma be brief, be true to the game\n\n[Break]\nYeah motherfucker, I see you got your fancy cars and shit, but you know what? You still ain't shit. That's right, I caught you slipping. You know I could've gat you, yeah, but I didn't even trip\n\n[Verse 3]\nA message to the Oreo cookie\nFind a mirror, and take a look, G\nDo you like what you see?\nBut you're quick to point the finger at me\nYou wanna be the big fish, you little guppy\nBlack man can't be no yuppie\nYou put on your suit and tie, and your big clothes\nYou don't associate with the Negroes\nYou wanna be just like Jack\nBut Jack, is calling you a nigga behind your back\nSo back off genius\nI don't need you to correct my broken English\nYou know that's right\nYou ain't white\nSo stop holding your ass tight\nCause you can't pass\nSo why you keep trying to pass?\nWith your black ass\nMister Big\nBut in reality, you're shorter than a midge\nYou only got yourself to blame\nGet a grip, Oreo, and be true to the game\n\n[Outro: Ice Cube and Leesa Gibbons]\nAnd Ice Cube practices what he preaches. He continues to live in South Central Los Angeles, and he puts his money into projects that improve the neighborhood\nBe true to the game!"}}, {"title": "A Gangsta's Fairytale", "album": "AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted", "year": "1990-05-16", "lyrics": "Intro: Little Russ, Ice Cube\n\n[Story-teller] Once upon a time, in the black part of the city\n[Young kid] Yo G, yo G you better get out of here man, 5-0\n[Door swings shut, car peels out]\n\n[Russ] Yo Ice Cube, man\n[Cube] Whassup man?\n[Russ] Why you...\n[Cube] Whassup?\n[Russ] Yo Ice Cube man, why you always kickin the shit about the bitches and the niggas?

Yo Ice Cube man, why you always kickin the shit about the bitches and the niggas? Why don't you kick some shit about the kids, man? The fuckin kids?!\n[Cube] Word\n\n[Verse One: Ice Cube]\nLittle boys and girls, they all love me\nCome sit on the lap of I-C-E\nAnd let me tell ya a story or two\nAbout a punk-ass nigga I knew\nNamed Jack, he wasn't that nimble, wasn't that quick\nJumped over the candlestick and burnt his dick\nRan up the street cause he was piping hot\nMet a bitch named Jill on the bus stop\nDropped a line or two, and he had the ho\nAt that type of shit he's a pro\nSo Jack and Jill ran up the hill to catch a lil nap\nDumb bitch, gave him the claps\nThen he had to go see Dr. Bombay\nGot a shot in the ass, and he was on his way\nTo make some money, why not?\nDown on Sesame Street, the dope spot\nThere he saw the lady who lived in a shoe\nSold dope out the front, but in back, marijuana grew\nFor the man that was really important\nWho lived down the street in a Air Jordan\nRide to the fellow Mister Rogers and hoes\nDrove a 500 sittin on Lorenzoes\nHe broke out, Little Bo Peep, smoked out\nSaw, her and her friends sellin sheepskins\n[Little Bo Peep] Yo yo I got them sheepskins\nYo, my empty sheepskins\nYo baby, what's up with that?\nHickory dickory dock, it was twelve o'clock\nCinderella ain't home must be givin up the cock\nI don't doubt it, she is kind of freaky of course\nHad a fight with Snow White, she was fuckin her dwarfs\nSaw a fight over colors, too\nRed Riding Hood, and Little Boy Blue\nA bad influence? Yo I don't know\nBut Ice Cube'll tell the kids how the story should go\n\n[Interlude: Little Russ]\nYeah money, that's it, yeah money, that's it\nThis is Little Russ in the house\nRock that shit homey, rock that shit!\n[Well, you know the rest]\n\n[Ice Cube]\nHumpty Dumpty sat on a wall\nWith a joint, drinkin some 8-ball\nThree little pigs in a Coup de Ville\nLookin for, the wolf to kill\nThey're fucked up and they want revenge\nThem and Humpty used to be friends\nNow they're enemies cause he's a traitor\nPulled out the Uzi cruised by and sprayed him\nCinderella hoeing for the fellas\nAnd Mister Rogers is gettin mighty jealous\nOf the cash that the pigs were makin\nTime for the pigs to get turned to bacon\nCause Mister Rogers found out quick\nThat Humpty Dumpty was blown to bits\nThey said that the motherfuckin wolf was next\nSo Mister Rogers better watch his step\nSo he let the wolf know\nWe're gonna fuck up the pigs, and take their ho\nCause Cinderella is much too fast\nBefore twelve, givin up ass\nDouble barrels all loaded and cocked\nAs soon as they show, they gonna get popped\nThey bailed down Sesame Street and caught em\nLittle Boy Blue is up front givin orders\nLittle did they know Cinderella was a fink\nShe called the cops and got thrown in the clink\nA bad influence? Yo, I don't know\nBut Ice Cube'll tell the kids how the stories should go\n\n[Outro: Little Russ, Ice Cube]\n[Cube] Aiyyo man was that dope enough for you?\n[Russ] Yeah you aight, you in the house\nWe outta here, seeeee-yaaaaa\n[Cube] Yeah you better go home before I whoop your little bad ass\n\n[Barney Rubble] Some bedtime story huh?\n[Bugs Bunny] It's a nice place to visit, but I wouldn't wanna live here\n[Andrew Dice Clay] Ay, good ol' Mother Goose, remember her?

near had to wreck a ho\nI knocked on the door, \"Who is it?\"\nIt's Ice Cube, come to pay a little visit to ya\nAnd what's up with the niggas in the parking lot\nShe said \"Fuck em, cause they get sparked a lot\"\nI sat on the couch but it wasn't stable\nAnd then I put my Nike's on the coffee table\nHer brother came in, he's into gang-bangin'\nCause he walked up and said \"What set you claimin'?\"\nI don't bang, I write the good rhymes\nThe whole scenery reminded me of Good Times\nI don't like to feel that I'm put in a rut\nBy a young nigga that needs to pull his pants up\nHe threw up a set and then he was gone\nI'm thinkin' to myself, won't this bitch bring her ass on?\nHer mother came in with a joint in her mouth\nAnd fired up the sess, it was sess no doubt\nShe said, \"Please excuse my house,\" and all that\nI said, \"Yeah,\" 'cause I was buzzed from the contact\nLookin' at a fucked up black and white\nHer mom's bitchin' cause the county check wasn't right\nShe had another brother that was three years old\nAnd had a bad case of the runny nose\nHe asked me who I was then I had to pause\nIt smelled like he took a shit in his little drawers\nI saw her sister who really needs her ass kicked\nOnly thirteen and already pregnant\nI grabbed my forty out the bag and took a swig\nCause I was getting overwhelmed by BeBe Kids\nThey was runnin' and yellin' and playin' and cussin' and tellin'\nAnd look at this young punk bailin'\nI heard a knock on the door without the password\nAnd her mom's got the twelve gauge Mossberg\nThe nigga said \"Yo, what's for sale\" (Yo, what's for sale, man?)\nAnd the bitch came out with a bag of yayo\nShe made the drop and got the twenty dollars\nFrom a smoked-out fool with ring around the collar\nThe girl I was waiting for came out\nI said, \"Bitch, I didn't know this was a crack house\"\nI got my coat, and suddenly\n(Stop, the police, don't move! Freeze, I'll kill ya!)\nThe cop busted in and had a Mac-10 pointed at my dome\nAnd I said to myself, \"once again it's on\"\nHe threw me on the carpet and wasn't cuttin' no slack\nJumped on my head and put his knee in my back\nFirst he tried to slap me up, wrap me up, rough me up\nThey couldn't do it so they cuffed me up\nI said, \"fuck, how much abuse can a nigga take\"\nHey yo officer you're making a big mistake\nSince I had on a shirt that said I was dope\nHe thought I was selling base and couldn't hear my case\nHe said, \"get out my face\" and musta had a grudge\nHis reply, \"Tell that bullshit to the judge\"\nThe girl I was with wasn't sayin nothin'\nI said \"Aiyyo bitch you better tell em somethin'\"\nShe started draggin' and all of a sudden\nWe all got tossed in the paddy wagon\nNow I beat the rap but that ain't the point\nI had a warrant so I spent two weeks in the joint\nNow the story you heard has one little object\nDon't fuck with a bitch from the projects"}}, {"title": "It Was a Good Day (Remix)", "album": "Bootlegs & B-Sides", "year": null, "lyrics": "Smooth.. heh.. yep..\nHeheheh.. remix..\n\nJust waking up in the mornin gotta thank God\nI don't know but today seems kinda odd\nNo barkin from the dogs, no smog\nAnd momma cooked a breakfast with no hog\nI got my grub on, but didn't pig out\nFinally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out\nHooked it up for later as I hit the do'\nThinkin will I live, another twenty-fo'\nI gotta go cause I got me a drop top\nAnd if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop\nHad to stop, at a red light\nLookin in my mirror and not a jacker in sight\nAnd everything is alright\nI got a beep from Kim, and she can do it all night\nCalled up the homies and I'm askin y'all\nWhich park, are y'all playin basketball?\nGet me on the court and I'm trouble\nLast week messed around and got a triple double\nFreakin brothers everyway like M.J\nI can't believe, today was a good day\n\nThat's right..\n\nCreep to the pad and hit the showers\nDidn't even get no static from the cowards\nCause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me\nSaw the police and they rolled right past me\nNo flexin, didn't even look in a brother's direction\nAs I ran the intersection\nWent to $hort Dog's house, they was watchin Yo! MTV Raps\nWhat's the haps on the craps?\nShake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em\nRoll 'em in a circle of homies and watch me break 'em\nWith the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven\nSeven even back do' Lil' Joe\nPicked up the cash flow\nThen we played bones, and I'm yellin domino\nPlus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A\nToday was a good day\n\nHehe..\n\nLeft my homie's house paid\nPicked up a girl been tryin to do since the twelve grade\nIt's ironic, I had the brew she had the chronic\nThe Lakers beat the Supersonics\nFelt on the big fat fanny\nPulled out the jammy, and killed the punanny\nAnd my jimmy runs deep, so deep\nSo deep put her butt to sleep\nWoke her up around one\nShe didn't hesitate, to call Ice Cube the top gun\nDrove her to the pad and I'm coastin\nTook another sip of the potion hit the three-wheel motion\nI was glad everything had worked out\nDropped her butt off and then chirped out\nToday was like one of those fly dreams\nDidn't even see a berry flashin those high beams\nNo helicopter lookin for the murder\nTwo in the mornin got the Fatburger\nEven saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp\nAnd it read, \"Ice Cube's a pimp\"\nDrunk as hell but no throwin up\nHalf way home and my pager still blowin up\nToday I didn't even have to use my A.K\nI gotta say it was a good day", "image":

thank God\nI don't know but today seems kinda odd\nNo barkin from the dogs, no smog\nAnd momma cooked a breakfast with no hog\nI got my grub on, but didn't pig out\nFinally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out\nHooked it up for later as I hit the do'\nThinkin will I live, another twenty-fo'\nI gotta go cause I got me a drop top\nAnd if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop\nHad to stop, at a red light\nLookin in my mirror and not a jacker in sight\nAnd everything is alright\nI got a beep from Kim, and she can do it all night\nCalled up the homies and I'm askin y'all\nWhich park, are y'all playin basketball?\nGet me on the court and I'm trouble\nLast week messed around and got a triple double\nFreakin brothers everyway like M.J\nI can't believe, today was a good day\n\nThat's right..\n\nCreep to the pad and hit the showers\nDidn't even get no static from the cowards\nCause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me\nSaw the police and they rolled right past me\nNo flexin, didn't even look in a brother's direction\nAs I ran the intersection\nWent to $hort Dog's house, they was watchin Yo! MTV Raps\nWhat's the haps on the craps?\nShake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em\nRoll 'em in a circle of homies and watch me break 'em\nWith the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven\nSeven even back do' Lil' Joe\nPicked up the cash flow\nThen we played bones, and I'm yellin domino\nPlus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A\nToday was a good day\n\nHehe..\n\nLeft my homie's house paid\nPicked up a girl been tryin to do since the twelve grade\nIt's ironic, I had the brew she had the chronic\nThe Lakers beat the Supersonics\nFelt on the big fat fanny\nPulled out the jammy, and killed the punanny\nAnd my jimmy runs deep, so deep\nSo deep put her butt to sleep\nWoke her up around one\nShe didn't hesitate, to call Ice Cube the top gun\nDrove her to the pad and I'm coastin\nTook another sip of the potion hit the three-wheel motion\nI was glad everything had worked out\nDropped her butt off and then chirped out\nToday was like one of those fly dreams\nDidn't even see a berry flashin those high beams\nNo helicopter lookin for the murder\nTwo in the mornin got the Fatburger\nEven saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp\nAnd it read, \"Ice Cube's a pimp\"\nDrunk as hell but no throwin up\nHalf way home and my pager still blowin up\nToday I didn't even have to use my A.K\nI gotta say it was a good day"}}, {"title": "Turn Off the Radio", "album": "AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted", "year": "1990-05-16", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nA message to the Oreo cookie:\nNo matter how much you wanna switch\nHere's what they think about you\n\n[Sample]\n\u201cYou gold teeth, gold chain wearing, fried chicken and biscuit eating monkey, ape, baboon, big thigh, fast running, high jumping, spear chucking, three-hundred-and-sixty-degree basketball dunking, titsun, spade, Moulan Yan. go the fuck back to Africa. go the fuck back to Africa. go the fuck back to Africa.\u201d\n\n[Interlude]\nThink about it, fuckin' sellout\nHere we go on station 103.787 and we're listening to\u2026\nWe won't be listening to, uh.

stavin, but fuck that Johnny Carson ho\nNever had me on the Late Night Show\nComin with the shit that'll hit\n+Steady Mobbin'+ cause the flavor's good\nThere goes the neighborhood\nNigga with the third album; how come he don't fall off?\nRollin with the sawed-off gauge\nTurn the page of the chapter, caught up in the rapture\nBut you know Anita, she can get the peter\nEat 'em up yum, and you're floored\nMotherfuck Billboard and the editor - here comes the Predator\n\n\"Yo I'm out, but - I'll be back\" (repeat 4X)\n\n[Ice Cube]\nCheck your head for the new style\nFuck Laurence Powell and Briseno - Wind and Koon, pretty soon\nWe'll fuck them like they fucked us and won't kiss 'em\nRiots ain't nothin but diets for the system\nFightin with the beast, no justice, no peace\nIf any, even if we fuck up Denny\nNiggas are sick of your white man tricks with no treat\nThat's right; now it's on, on sight\nYou call me a Muslim, no I'm not a resident\nStill got my vote in - Farrakhan for president\nOf white America, I'm tearing ya a new asshole\nWho's the nigga with the new black\nStrollin to your suburb house and I douse\nWith gas, now who's cleanin up trash?\nEat 'em up yum, and you're floored\nMotherfuck Billboard and the editor - here comes the Predator\n\n\"Yo I'm out, but - I'll be back\" (repeat 3X)\n\"Yo I'm out..\"\n\"Here comes the Predator\"\n\n\"There's somethin out

motherfuckers criticize rappers and what they say\nEven though they criticize secretly they fantasize\nBut they know they'll never be paid to play\n\nYeah I'mma kill one of you young punks\nWith an old school flow, flow, flow\n\n[Verse 1]\nThough I walk through the shadow of death\nI gotta make sure that my shoes and my outfit fresh\nYou bitches get jealous when you see me coming\nY'all would too if you see my woman\nNow y'all know we about to do what we do\nThis shit right here bout as sick as the flu\nDrunk motherfuckers wanna vomit on my shoe\nNiggas can't have shit probably 'cause of you\nRappers go to jail like Oprah go to Yale\nSteffan Policy don't ask don't tell\nWears my Wallabees as I go get the mail\nHalf black is the new black can't you tell ?\nIt was blue black like Wesley Snipes in New Jack\nNow you got to have a white mama just to do that\nTiger Woods, he used to be a safe nigga\nGo ahead let your daughter have a date with him\nHe'll make with her probablly in a wife beater\nTiger bout to change his name to cheater\nI don't like it when you call me Big Poppa\nFrom South Central and I hate helicopters\nIf we at school I'll break in your locker\nSee me with a water bottle, it's probably vodka\nDrink responsibly or drink constantly\nBe who you wanna be in this economy\nDrunk as Sean Connery at the finery\nCan't throw me out motherfucker I'm the honoree\nTrust me, I'll never be the nominee\nI don't kiss enough ass, I'm too ornery\nIce cube be where the piranhas be\nSwimming upstream eatin' all kind of meat\nWest Coast treat it like hyenas\nTake what you want from these lying ass cheaters\nEat the fuck out these fake-ass beavers\nThat's how we act when you don't wanna feed us\nCrazy motherfucker ever since I was a fetus\nMight as well join us you ain't gonna beat us\nPlease believe us, you can ask Jesus\nI'mma be here 'bout as long as Regis\nUnderstand I never pledge of allegiance\nTo this ball of confusion, might cause a contusion, boy\nI see you're cruising for a bruising\nFucking with a principal that don't like students\nDon't you know, detention is a lynching\nAnd if I forget to mention then I'm spending out my pension\nNo no no no\n\n[Bridge/Hook]\nThe reason I hone in\n'Cause this right here ain't no country for young men\nSonny you done fucked up the Church's money\nI'm Redd Foxx and you that big dummy\nThis junkyard was an empire\nY'all let it get overran by vampires\nMost MCs is goddamn lies\nLike them fucking supervisors working up at Kaiser\nBitch, I'm not a Dodger, I'm a Laker, punk\nYou'se a fucking clipper you can call me Jack The Ripper\nCut you up by your guiser then down by your liver\nRooter to the tooter, gut you like flipper\nDipper, y'all better treat me like the skipper\nHair trigger, for e'ry nigga\nE'ry honkey and e'ry critter\nI come through and kill every litter\nLike that like that like that...\n\n[Outro]\nNo country for young men\nNo no no no\nIt's just a world of confusion\nNo country for young men\nNo no no no\nYour world is just an illusion\nNo country for young men\nNo no no no\nIts a ball of confusion\nNo country for young men\nNo no no no\nYour world is just an illusion\n\n[Guitar Outro]"}}, {"title": "Do Ya Thang", "album": "Raw Footage", "year": "2008-07-01", "lyrics": "[Hook]\nDo ya thang, mayne\nFuck what they lookin' at!\nDo ya thang, mayne\nFuck what

instinct?\nAnd the white man sittin' there tickled pink\nLaughin' at us on the avenue\nBustin' caps at each other after havin' brew\nWe can't enjoy ourselves\nToo busy jealous... at each other's wealth\nComin' up is just in me\nBut the Black community is full of envy\nToo much back-stabbin'\nWhile I look out the window I see all the Japs grabbin'\nEvery vacant lot in my neighborhood\nBuild a store, and sell their goods\nTo the county recips\nYou know, us po niggas; nappy hair and big lips?\nFour or five babies on your crotch\nAnd you expect Uncle Sam to help us out?\nWe ain't nothin' but porchmonkeys\nTo the average bigot, redneck honky\nYou say comin' up is a must\nBut before we can come up, take a look at US\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd all y'all dope-dealers...\nYou're as bad as the po-lice- cause ya kill us\nYou got rich when you started slangin' dope\nBut you ain't built us a supermarket\nSo when can spend our money with the blacks\nToo busy buyin' gold an' Cadillacs\nThat's what ya doin' with the money that ya raisin'\nExploitin' us like the Caucasians did\nFor 400 years - I got 400 tears- for 400 peers\nDied last year from gang-related crimes\nThat's why I got gang-related rhymes\nBut when I do a show ta kick some facts\nUs Blacks don't know how ta act\nSometimes I believe the hype, man\nWe mess it up ourselves and blame the white man\nBut don't point the finger you jiggaboo\nTake a look at yourself ya dumb nigga you\nPretty soon hip-hop won't be so nice\nNo Ice Cube, just Vanilla Ice\nAnd yall sit and scream and cuss\nBut there's no one ta blame- but US\n\n[Verse 3]\nUS ... will always sing the blues\nCause all we care about is hairstyles and tennis shoes\nAnd if ya step on mine ya pushed a button\n\"Cause I'll beat you down like it ain't nothin'\"\nJust like a beast\nBut I'm the first nigga ta holler out {PEACE, BLACK MAN}\nI beat my wife and children to a pulp\nWhen I get drunk and smoke dope\nGot a bad heart condition\nStill eat hog-mogs an' chitlin's\nBet my money on the dice and the horses\nJobless, so I'm a hope for the armed forces\nGo to church but they tease us\nWit' a picture of a blue-eyed Jesus\nThey used to call me Negro\nAfter all this time I'm still bustin' up the chiffarobe\nNo respect and ignored\nAnd I'm havin' more babies than I really can afford\nIn jail cause I can't pay the mother\nHeld back in life because of my color\nNow this is just a little summary\nOf US, but yall think it's dumb of me\nTo hold a mirror to ya face, but trust\nNobody gives a fuck about...", "image":

sittin' there tickled pink\nLaughin' at us on the avenue\nBustin' caps at each other after havin' brew\nWe can't enjoy ourselves\nToo busy jealous... at each other's wealth\nComin' up is just in me\nBut the Black community is full of envy\nToo much back-stabbin'\nWhile I look out the window I see all the Japs grabbin'\nEvery vacant lot in my neighborhood\nBuild a store, and sell their goods\nTo the county recips\nYou know, us po niggas; nappy hair and big lips?\nFour or five babies on your crotch\nAnd you expect Uncle Sam to help us out?\nWe ain't nothin' but porchmonkeys\nTo the average bigot, redneck honky\nYou say comin' up is a must\nBut before we can come up, take a look at US\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd all y'all dope-dealers...\nYou're as bad as the po-lice- cause ya kill us\nYou got rich when you started slangin' dope\nBut you ain't built us a supermarket\nSo when can spend our money with the blacks\nToo busy buyin' gold an' Cadillacs\nThat's what ya doin' with the money that ya raisin'\nExploitin' us like the Caucasians did\nFor 400 years - I got 400 tears- for 400 peers\nDied last year from gang-related crimes\nThat's why I got gang-related rhymes\nBut when I do a show ta kick some facts\nUs Blacks don't know how ta act\nSometimes I believe the hype, man\nWe mess it up ourselves and blame the white man\nBut don't point the finger you jiggaboo\nTake a look at yourself ya dumb nigga you\nPretty soon hip-hop won't be so nice\nNo Ice Cube, just Vanilla Ice\nAnd yall sit and scream and cuss\nBut there's no one ta blame- but US\n\n[Verse 3]\nUS ... will always sing the blues\nCause all we care about is hairstyles and tennis shoes\nAnd if ya step on mine ya pushed a button\n\"Cause I'll beat you down like it ain't nothin'\"\nJust like a beast\nBut I'm the first nigga ta holler out {PEACE, BLACK MAN}\nI beat my wife and children to a pulp\nWhen I get drunk and smoke dope\nGot a bad heart condition\nStill eat hog-mogs an' chitlin's\nBet my money on the dice and the horses\nJobless, so I'm a hope for the armed forces\nGo to church but they tease us\nWit' a picture of a blue-eyed Jesus\nThey used to call me Negro\nAfter all this time I'm still bustin' up the chiffarobe\nNo respect and ignored\nAnd I'm havin' more babies than I really can afford\nIn jail cause I can't pay the mother\nHeld back in life because of my color\nNow this is just a little summary\nOf US, but yall think it's dumb of me\nTo hold a mirror to ya face, but trust\nNobody gives a fuck about..."}}, {"title": "Endangered Species (Tales from the Darkside)", "album": "AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted", "year": "1990-05-16", "lyrics": "[Intro: Female News Reporter]\n\"At the bottom of our news tonight, there's been a new animal aimed at falling off the face of our Earth. Yes, young black teenagers are reported to be the oldest, and the newest, creatures added to the endangered species list. As of now, no efforts have been made to preserve the Blacks. When asked why, a top top law official adds, \"Because they make good game\"\"\n\n(A young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown)\n\n[Verse 1: Ice Cube]\nPeace? Hahaha, don't make me laugh!\nAll I hear is motherfuckers rappin' succotash\nLivin' large, tellin' me to get out the gang\nI'm a nigga, gotta live by the trigga\nHow the fuck do you figure\nThat I can say \"Peace\" and the gunshots will cease?\nEvery cop killer goes ignored\nThey just send another nigga to the morgue\nA point scored, they could give a fuck about us\nThey rather catch us with guns and white powder\nIf I was old, they'd probably be a friend of me\nSince I'm young, they consider me the enemy\nThey kill ten of me to get the job correct\nTo serve, protect, and break a nigga's neck\nCuz I'm the one with the trunk of funk\nAnd \"Fuck tha Police\" in the tape deck\nYou should listen to me cuz there's more to see\nCall my neighborhood a ghetto cuz it houses minorities\nThe other color don't know you can run but not hide\nThese are tales from the darkside\n\n[Interlude: Chuck D + sample]\nAll of us are endangered, damn!\n(A young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown)\n(A young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown)\n\n[Verse 2: Ice Cube]\nYou wanna free Africa? I'll stare at ya\nCuz we ain't got it too good in America\nI can't fuck with them overseas\nMy homeboy died over keys\nOf cocaine, it was plain and simple\nThe 9mm went (buck) to the temple\n(Buck, buck, buck) was the sound I put the bitch down\nAnd ran to the schoolyard bathroom\nLooked in the trash can, yo it had room\nSo I ducked my ass in it for a minute\nCovered with trash I had to lay back\nMad as fuck, thinkin' about the payback\nTonight the crew gonna have a little fun\nI went home and cut the barrel of my shotgun\nIt's gettin' critical - I stole a 5.0\nI let it go - drive real slow\nI yelled out \"Ice Cube, sucka\"\nThe shotgun kicked, and it murdered motherfuckers\nI told you last album\n\"When I got a sawed-off, bodies are hauled off\"\nIts a shame, that niggas die young\nBut to the light side it don't matter none\nIt'll be a drive by homicide\nBut to me its just another tale from the darkside\n\n[Interlude]\n[Sampled guitar riff]\n\n[Verse 3: Chuck D]\nStanding in the middle of war, in the middle we flex\nWhen we die, we won't make Jet\nEbony can't see to the light side\nThe term they apply to us is a nigga\nCall it what you want, cause I'm comin\u2019 from the corner\nSame applies to a Ph.D\nWho's black - don't wanna roll - sells his soul\nWatch his head go rollin\u2019\nWho the fuck are they foolin\u2019?\nNobody knows, but I suppose the color of my clothes\nMatches the color of the one on my face\nAs they wonder whats under my waist\n(Standin' on the verge) of them gettin\u2019 brown\nThat's a fact, got a fear of the bozack\nRun, run, run, their ass off, they can not hide\nYeah Cube, they can't fuck with the darkside!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1cb382d2d9fb4a9bfa94e3074c1aa220.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Ice Cube", "raw":

Yes, young black teenagers are reported to be the oldest, and the newest, creatures added to the endangered species list. As of now, no efforts have been made to preserve the Blacks. When asked why, a top top law official adds, \"Because they make good game\"\"\n\n(A young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown)\n\n[Verse 1: Ice Cube]\nPeace? Hahaha, don't make me laugh!\nAll I hear is motherfuckers rappin' succotash\nLivin' large, tellin' me to get out the gang\nI'm a nigga, gotta live by the trigga\nHow the fuck do you figure\nThat I can say \"Peace\" and the gunshots will cease?\nEvery cop killer goes ignored\nThey just send another nigga to the morgue\nA point scored, they could give a fuck about us\nThey rather catch us with guns and white powder\nIf I was old, they'd probably be a friend of me\nSince I'm young, they consider me the enemy\nThey kill ten of me to get the job correct\nTo serve, protect, and break a nigga's neck\nCuz I'm the one with the trunk of funk\nAnd \"Fuck tha Police\" in the tape deck\nYou should listen to me cuz there's more to see\nCall my neighborhood a ghetto cuz it houses minorities\nThe other color don't know you can run but not hide\nThese are tales from the darkside\n\n[Interlude: Chuck D + sample]\nAll of us are endangered, damn!\n(A young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown)\n(A young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown)\n\n[Verse 2: Ice Cube]\nYou wanna free Africa? I'll stare at ya\nCuz we ain't got it too good in America\nI can't fuck with them overseas\nMy homeboy died over keys\nOf cocaine, it was plain and simple\nThe 9mm went (buck) to the temple\n(Buck, buck, buck) was the sound I put the bitch down\nAnd ran to the schoolyard bathroom\nLooked in the trash can, yo it had room\nSo I ducked my ass in it for a minute\nCovered with trash I had to lay back\nMad as fuck, thinkin' about the payback\nTonight the crew gonna have a little fun\nI went home and cut the barrel of my shotgun\nIt's gettin' critical - I stole a 5.0\nI let it go - drive real slow\nI yelled out \"Ice Cube, sucka\"\nThe shotgun kicked, and it murdered motherfuckers\nI told you last album\n\"When I got a sawed-off, bodies are hauled off\"\nIts a shame, that niggas die young\nBut to the light side it don't matter none\nIt'll be a drive by homicide\nBut to me its just another tale from the darkside\n\n[Interlude]\n[Sampled guitar riff]\n\n[Verse 3: Chuck D]\nStanding in the middle of war, in the middle we flex\nWhen we die, we won't make Jet\nEbony can't see to the light side\nThe term they apply to us is a nigga\nCall it what you want, cause I'm comin\u2019 from the corner\nSame applies to a Ph.D\nWho's black - don't wanna roll - sells his soul\nWatch his head go rollin\u2019\nWho the fuck are they foolin\u2019?\nNobody knows, but I suppose the color of my clothes\nMatches the color of the one on my face\nAs they wonder whats under my waist\n(Standin' on the verge) of them gettin\u2019 brown\nThat's a fact, got a fear of the bozack\nRun, run, run, their ass off, they can not hide\nYeah Cube, they can't fuck with the darkside!"}}, {"title": "You Can't Fade Me / JD's Gafflin'", "album": "AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted", "year": "1990-05-16", "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Ice Cube]\nNow the taste of alcohol is filling up my bladder\nWhat's the date and time, it don't matter\nHad a pocket full of phone numbers, I was trying to sort\nTo make a long story short\nRan into, this girl named Carla\nKnew her from the back seat of my homie's Impala\nShe said what's up, yeah what's the deal\nCheck the hairdo of course it ain't real\nThen I looked down she was fat in the front\nI asked how long, well about seven months\nOh how time flies when you're having fun\nShe said \"Yeah but the damage is done\nWhere you been?\" \"On a little vacation\nOh by the way, congratulations\nWho's the lucky man?\" I don't have a clue\nThen she said \"The lucky man is you.\" I dropped my brew\nAnd everything looked fuzzy\nNot a baby by you, the neighborhood hussy\nShe said \"Yeah remember that date?\"\nI thought back and tried to calculate\nThen I said \"Damn, are you sure it's mine?\n'Cause I know you been tossed plenty of times\"\nShe said \"That day, no I wasn't whoring\nYour ass is mine,\" that's when the sweat started pouring\n'Cause all I saw was Ice Cube in court\nPaying a gang on child support\nThen I thought deep about giving up the money\nWhat I need to do is kick the bitch in the tummy\nNaw 'cause then I'd really get faded\nThat's murder one 'cause it was premeditated\nSo what I'mma do, I don't have a clue\nHow many months left, damn only two\nI'm gettin faded\n\n[Hook]\n(\"Livin' and jivin' and diggin' the skin he's in...\")\nNo cigar, G\n[(\"Livin' and jivin' and diggin' the skin he's in\" \"Whoa yeah\")]\n[(\"Livin' and jivin' and

sleep with her\nI had to duck and dodge and try to creep with her\nSee the booty and the front was all in place\nBut the girl had the pitbull face\nSo we ran jumped drove swam crawled hid\nOh lord god forbid\nMy homies see me at the motel\n'Cause those fools would love to just go tell\nEverybody in the hood that knows your rep\nSo jump in the back seat and quiet is kept\nAnd hold your big fat butt steady\n'Cause yo, ho, I got the paper bag ready\nShe started moaning and gobbling like a turkey\nI knocked the boots from here to Albuquerque\nI dropped her off man and I'm knowing\nThat I'm a hate myself in the morning\nI got drunk to help me forget\nYo another day another hit, shit\nI'm gettin faded\n\n[Hook]\n(\"Livin' and jivin' and diggin' the skin he's in...\")\nAy yo, you know what time it is\n(\"Livin' and jivin' and diggin' the skin he's in\" \"Whoa yeah\")\n\n[Verse 3: Ice Cube]\nNine months later she's ready to drop the load\nAnd everybody in the hood already knows\nIt's supposed to be mine so they laughing at me\nYou know Ice Cube can't be having that, G\nI'm thinking to myself why did I bang her\nNow I'm in the closet looking for the hanger\nJD and Jinx and T-Bone won't let up, they won't shut up\nI'm gettin fed up, bitch\n'Cause I know you're tryin' to break me\nBut if I find out your tryin' to fake me\nI'm a buff that duff and hoot\nBeat ya down and leave a crown or two\nThat night she went into labor\nAnd the shit is getting kinda major\nThe baby came out damn it was a lifesaver\nLooking like my next-door neighbor\nShe said it was mine that was her best guess\nBut let's check the results of the blood test\nI started smiling yeah 'cause it read negative\nDamn, why did I let her live?\nAfter that I should've got the gat\nAnd bust and rushed and illed and peeled the cap\nBut no I just told the ho who laid me\nExcuse me bitch it's a switch\nYou can't fade me\n\n[Outro]\nNaw baby, not this way\nYo, you ain't playing Ice Cube out like no booger\nI don't fall for the okey-doke\nAnd before I fall for the okey-doke, I let the pistol smoke\nNow sing it\n(\"Livin' and jivin' and diggin' the skin he's in...\")\nHa ha, yeah baby, you can't fade me\n(\"Livin' and jivin' and diggin' the skin he's in\" \"Whoa yeah\")\n(\"Livin' and jivin' and diggin' the skin he's in...\")\nNah, unfadeable baby, yo\n(\"Livin' and jivin' and diggin' the skin

date and time, it don't matter\nHad a pocket full of phone numbers, I was trying to sort\nTo make a long story short\nRan into, this girl named Carla\nKnew her from the back seat of my homie's Impala\nShe said what's up, yeah what's the deal\nCheck the hairdo of course it ain't real\nThen I looked down she was fat in the front\nI asked how long, well about seven months\nOh how time flies when you're having fun\nShe said \"Yeah but the damage is done\nWhere you been?\" \"On a little vacation\nOh by the way, congratulations\nWho's the lucky man?\" I don't have a clue\nThen she said \"The lucky man is you.\" I dropped my brew\nAnd everything looked fuzzy\nNot a baby by you, the neighborhood hussy\nShe said \"Yeah remember that date?\"\nI thought back and tried to calculate\nThen I said \"Damn, are you sure it's mine?\n'Cause I know you been tossed plenty of times\"\nShe said \"That day, no I wasn't whoring\nYour ass is mine,\" that's when the sweat started pouring\n'Cause all I saw was Ice Cube in court\nPaying a gang on child support\nThen I thought deep about giving up the money\nWhat I need to do is kick the bitch in the tummy\nNaw 'cause then I'd really get faded\nThat's murder one 'cause it was premeditated\nSo what I'mma do, I don't have a clue\nHow many months left, damn only two\nI'm gettin faded\n\n[Hook]\n(\"Livin' and jivin' and diggin' the skin he's in...\")\nNo cigar, G\n[(\"Livin' and jivin' and diggin' the skin he's in\" \"Whoa yeah\")]\n[(\"Livin' and jivin' and diggin' the skin he's in...\")]\nAy yo, homey, man, I'm getting faded\n[(\"Livin' and jivin' and diggin' the skin he's in\" \"Whoa yeah\")]\n\n[Verse 2: Ice Cube]\nIt's crazy 'cause before I could sleep with her\nI had to duck and dodge and try to creep with her\nSee the booty and the front was all in place\nBut the girl had the pitbull face\nSo we ran jumped drove swam crawled hid\nOh lord god forbid\nMy homies see me at the motel\n'Cause those fools would love to just go tell\nEverybody in the hood that knows your rep\nSo jump in the back seat and quiet is kept\nAnd hold your big fat butt steady\n'Cause yo, ho, I got the paper bag ready\nShe started moaning and gobbling like a turkey\nI knocked the boots from here to Albuquerque\nI dropped her off man and I'm knowing\nThat I'm a hate myself in the morning\nI got drunk to help me forget\nYo another day another hit, shit\nI'm gettin faded\n\n[Hook]\n(\"Livin' and jivin' and diggin' the skin he's in...\")\nAy yo, you know what time it is\n(\"Livin' and jivin' and diggin' the skin he's in\" \"Whoa yeah\")\n\n[Verse 3: Ice Cube]\nNine months later she's ready to drop the load\nAnd everybody in the hood already knows\nIt's supposed to be mine so they laughing at me\nYou know Ice Cube can't be having that, G\nI'm thinking to myself why did I bang her\nNow I'm in the closet looking for the hanger\nJD and Jinx and T-Bone won't let up, they won't shut up\nI'm gettin fed up, bitch\n'Cause I know you're tryin' to break me\nBut if I find out your tryin' to fake me\nI'm a buff that duff and hoot\nBeat ya down and leave a crown or two\nThat night she went into labor\nAnd the shit is getting kinda major\nThe baby came out damn it was a lifesaver\nLooking like my next-door neighbor\nShe said it was mine that was her best guess\nBut let's check the results of the blood test\nI started smiling yeah 'cause it read negative\nDamn, why did I let her live?\nAfter that I should've got the gat\nAnd bust and rushed and illed and peeled the cap\nBut no I just told the ho who laid me\nExcuse me bitch it's a switch\nYou can't fade me\n\n[Outro]\nNaw baby, not this way\nYo, you ain't playing Ice Cube out like no booger\nI don't fall for the okey-doke\nAnd before I fall for the okey-doke, I let the pistol smoke\nNow sing it\n(\"Livin' and jivin' and diggin' the skin he's in...\")\nHa ha, yeah baby, you can't fade me\n(\"Livin' and jivin' and diggin' the skin he's in\" \"Whoa yeah\")\n(\"Livin' and jivin' and diggin' the skin he's in...\")\nNah, unfadeable baby, yo\n(\"Livin' and jivin' and diggin' the skin he's in\" \"Whoa yeah\")\n\n[Segue: \"JD's Gafflin'\"]\nI ain't never got gaffled like that, I used to do the gafflin'\nMcDonald's is my spot (What you used to do?)\nJack them motherfuckers for them Nissan trucks\nRight in the drive-thru.  \"Nigga, get your motherfuckin' food, leave it in the car, nigga, get out.\"  Straight jackin'"}}, {"title": "Get Off My Dick and Tell Yo Bitch to Come Here (Remix)", "album": "Kill at Will EP", "year": "1990-12-18", "lyrics": "[Flavor Flav] Stay off his dick!\n\n[Verse 1: Ice Cube]\nNigga, some don't think I can flow, so here we go\nTo a new track, to show the wack, that I can throw\nStyles that show up, I blow up and blast here\nNiggas still tripping off the shit I said last year\nAbout a bitch is a bitch is a ho is a slut\nAnd I don't like niggas on my nuts!\nSo I dedicate this one to the groupie\nAnd the Charlie, all on my Snoopy\nBrothers keep askin, \"Ice Cube yo when will you bust\"\nThey surround me and make a big fuss\nNow I was taught, back on my block\nThat you don't ride on nobody's jock\nFor anything they do, FUCK him and his crew\nUnless, you were gettin paid too!\nI'm not saying this to diss each and every fan\nWomen you can ride; men, be a man!\nShake my hand, and make it a FIRM shake\nSay, \"Whattup Ice Cube?\" and then break\nCause if you're hanging near I'mma tell you loud and clear\nGet off my my dick, nigga, and tell your bitch to come here\n\nMotherfucker, back up off me\nI'm not signing no autographs, I'm not giving no free t-shirts\nAnd I'm not HAVING none of this bullshit you're talking\nYouknowhatI'msayin?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI step into the club to rub-a-dub\nIt seems like all the little hoes fall in love\nWith my money, cause yo about a year ago\nI was just your ordinary average everyday crazy ass broke\nBut you know, I just can't be equal\nCause they know I know a lot of famous people\nBut to a one-night stand, there's no sequel\nHere's the pickle, pretend it's a Popsicle\nSee, for a fat booty, I do damage\nThey think I'm a star, so I take advantage\nIt's just another Ice Cube groupie fest\nShe's a ho cause they knew her at the front desk\nTold her to meet me at the room 110\nAnd the bitch showed up with her boyfriend\nI let him in, all he could do was grin\nHe had a camera, a t-shirt, a pad and pen\nHe said, \"Yo, Ice Cube, can you sign this?\"\nI only did it cause his bitch was the finest\nShe blew me a kiss and gave a bitter frown\nLike, \"How can we get rid of this clown?\"\nMe and her sat down, he got a little jealous\nCause his punk ass sat in the middle of us\nAnd he asked me question after question\nIt felt like a motherfucking interview session\nThen his girl got up, I heard the door shut\nAnd he was still there, swinging from my nuts\nI said, \"Get the FUCK out!\" and made it loud and clear\nGet off my dick, nigga, and tell your bitch to come here\n\nI see me about ten mark ass motherfucking fans\nKnock on the door, talking about whassup?\n\nYo man, it was about a hundred and twenty dicks man\nNiggas start, niggas coming out of hotel rooms\nWithout no bitches!\n\nThey can get gaffled like they in a motherfucking raffle\nPunk ass\n\n[Verse 3]\nYo, I respect the respectable\nIf your girl is all on my dick, check the ho\nSay, \"Yeah that nigga he can rap fly\nBut you know, stars are up in the sky\"\nCause all I got is hard dick and bubblegum\nJust ran out my last stick is where I'm coming from\nI'm not telling you to diss Mr. Ice Cube\nCause you know, I'm the one that can show and prove\nNow groupie girls, I just make em wait\nBut the groupie boys, I can't tolerate\nI hate it so much, I'mma start giving stitches\nTo the niggas that's staring like bitches\nCause I'm not a fairy, a Mary or a faggot\nGimme the eye, I'll fly, and tag it\nNow you see? Jocking ain't healthy\nCause you think that I'm young and I'm wealthy\nWith juice, so I see you try to run behind\nBut I'mma tell you, punk, you gets none of mine\nCause I was taught, see a fool, use a fool\nBy the niggas who terrorized the old school\nSo don't try me or buy me a beer\nJust stay off my dick, nigga", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6c223fafae72a06b4952ce4b3f7e6b7a.992x991x1.jpg", "artist": "Ice Cube", "raw": {"annotation_count": 10, "api_path": "/songs/22998", "apple_music_id": "1005219872", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/22998/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "A remix of a notably-titled song from Cube\u2019s debut solo album adds two extra verses to further clarify exactly who he wants to get off what and come where.

can flow, so here we go\nTo a new track, to show the wack, that I can throw\nStyles that show up, I blow up and blast here\nNiggas still tripping off the shit I said last year\nAbout a bitch is a bitch is a ho is a slut\nAnd I don't like niggas on my nuts!\nSo I dedicate this one to the groupie\nAnd the Charlie, all on my Snoopy\nBrothers keep askin, \"Ice Cube yo when will you bust\"\nThey surround me and make a big fuss\nNow I was taught, back on my block\nThat you don't ride on nobody's jock\nFor anything they do, FUCK him and his crew\nUnless, you were gettin paid too!\nI'm not saying this to diss each and every fan\nWomen you can ride; men, be a man!\nShake my hand, and make it a FIRM shake\nSay, \"Whattup Ice Cube?\" and then break\nCause if you're hanging near I'mma tell you loud and clear\nGet off my my dick, nigga, and tell your bitch to come here\n\nMotherfucker, back up off me\nI'm not signing no autographs, I'm not giving no free t-shirts\nAnd I'm not HAVING none of this bullshit you're talking\nYouknowhatI'msayin?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI step into the club to rub-a-dub\nIt seems like all the little hoes fall in love\nWith my money, cause yo about a year ago\nI was just your ordinary average everyday crazy ass broke\nBut you know, I just can't be equal\nCause they know I know a lot of famous people\nBut to a one-night stand, there's no sequel\nHere's the pickle, pretend it's a Popsicle\nSee, for a fat booty, I do damage\nThey think I'm a star, so I take advantage\nIt's just another Ice Cube groupie fest\nShe's a ho cause they knew her at the front desk\nTold her to meet me at the room 110\nAnd the bitch showed up with her boyfriend\nI let him in, all he could do was grin\nHe had a camera, a t-shirt, a pad and pen\nHe said, \"Yo, Ice Cube, can you sign this?\"\nI only did it cause his bitch was the finest\nShe blew me a kiss and gave a bitter frown\nLike, \"How can we get rid of this clown?\"\nMe and her sat down, he got a little jealous\nCause his punk ass sat in the middle of us\nAnd he asked me question after question\nIt felt like a motherfucking interview session\nThen his girl got up, I heard the door shut\nAnd he was still there, swinging from my nuts\nI said, \"Get the FUCK out!\" and made it loud and clear\nGet off my dick, nigga, and tell your bitch to come here\n\nI see me about ten mark ass motherfucking fans\nKnock on the door, talking about whassup?\n\nYo man, it was about a hundred and twenty dicks man\nNiggas start, niggas coming out of hotel rooms\nWithout no bitches!\n\nThey can get gaffled like they in a motherfucking raffle\nPunk ass\n\n[Verse 3]\nYo, I respect the respectable\nIf your girl is all on my dick, check the ho\nSay, \"Yeah that nigga he can rap fly\nBut you know, stars are up in the sky\"\nCause all I got is hard dick and bubblegum\nJust ran out my last stick is where I'm coming from\nI'm not telling you to diss Mr. Ice Cube\nCause you know, I'm the one that can show and prove\nNow groupie girls, I just make em wait\nBut the groupie boys, I can't tolerate\nI hate it so much, I'mma start giving stitches\nTo the niggas that's staring like bitches\nCause I'm not a fairy, a Mary or a faggot\nGimme the eye, I'll fly, and tag it\nNow you see? Jocking ain't healthy\nCause you think that I'm young and I'm wealthy\nWith juice, so I see you try to run behind\nBut I'mma tell you, punk, you gets none of mine\nCause I was taught, see a fool, use a fool\nBy the niggas who terrorized the old school\nSo don't try me or buy me a beer\nJust stay off my dick, nigga"}}, {"title": "Horny Lil' Devil", "album": "Death Certificate", "year": "1991-10-29", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nYou are the prince of darkness\nArch enemy, father of evil\nHell born, demonic, savage, fierce, vicious, wild\nTameless, barbaric, uncontrollabe, obstinate beast\n\n[Verse 1]\nHorny little devil, you gotta back up\nHorny little devil, you can't bust a nut\nLookin' at my girlfriend's black skin\nYou wanna jump in, but she don't like white men\nSo don't flirt at work, you fuckin' jerk\nOr get your punk devil ass hurt motherfucker\nShe ain't with the pale face\nCause y'all fuck at a snail's pace\nAnd you might get sprayed with mace, from the ebony\nSo when she's doing her job you better let her be\nDon't try to pinch the gluterus\nThinkin' that you about to knock out the uterus\nCause she'll tell you to kiss her ass quick\nAnd where I'm from, devils get they ass kicked\nMr. Sexual Harrasment\nAsking for a blow and when the answer is \"fuck no\"\nLooks like you wanna terminate\nBut that's when I go Psycho like Norman Bates\nI wanna kill the devil for talkin' shit\nCause he can't get a taste of the chocolate\nAfrican breasts; cause white bitches have no butt and no chest\nBlack women have bodies like goddesses\nSorta like Venus, but put away your penis\nCause the devil is a savage motherfucker\nThat's why I'm lighter than the average brother\nCause you raped our women, and we felt it\nBut it'll never happen again if I can help it (me neither)\nCause nobody in my neighborhood has caught jungle fever yet\nSo horny little devil, you better listen\nBefore yo' ass come up missin'\nAnd it's like that\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow you wanna get me\nHorny little devil must be, a F-A-G\nTryin to fuck me out my land and my manhood\nHave me broke eatin' Spam, and canned goods\nLocking down on my neighborhoods\nTreat me less than a man cause right now you got the upper hand\nBut my ass is a virgin\nYou might have fucked the Indians\nBut you can't surgeon me\nAnd when I'm on top I won't be fuckin ya\nI'd rather put a buck in ya\nCause I hate the devil with a passion\nAnd when I see the whites of his eyes I start blastin'\nDig a hole and throw his ass in\nAnd I won't be happy till I'm down to my last ten\nGet his fuckin' pitchfork\nTie him up, and then feed the bitch pork\nLittle devil can't fuck me out my pay\nCause horny little devil true niggas ain't gay\nAnd you can't play with my Yo-Yo\nAnd definitely can't play with me you fuckin' homo\nCause we'll blow your head off\nAnd turn that white sheet, 'to a red cloth\nPlus when they're all dead\nI can cut that Jheri juice and get a bald head\nThen let it nap up\nGo down to the corner store and beat the Jap up\nClean all the crap up\nOut my city, now the whole block look shitty\nPut his dick on a wood block\nSwing swing swing, and chop chop chop\nNow who's the next to nut\nColor Me Badd, but you can't sex me up\nSo don't even try it, put your dick on a diet\nCause this is Watts Riot 1991 and I'ma get my gun\nPut an end to the devil, so get a fucking shovel\n\n(repeat chorus)", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/89a02ab603eae95e0d380fcd08eda589.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Ice Cube", "raw": {"annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/22962", "apple_music_id": "1241082215", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/22962/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "It had been popular since Malcolm X\u2019s days in the 60s to refer to the white man as the devil.

1]\nHorny little devil, you gotta back up\nHorny little devil, you can't bust a nut\nLookin' at my girlfriend's black skin\nYou wanna jump in, but she don't like white men\nSo don't flirt at work, you fuckin' jerk\nOr get your punk devil ass hurt motherfucker\nShe ain't with the pale face\nCause y'all fuck at a snail's pace\nAnd you might get sprayed with mace, from the ebony\nSo when she's doing her job you better let her be\nDon't try to pinch the gluterus\nThinkin' that you about to knock out the uterus\nCause she'll tell you to kiss her ass quick\nAnd where I'm from, devils get they ass kicked\nMr. Sexual Harrasment\nAsking for a blow and when the answer is \"fuck no\"\nLooks like you wanna terminate\nBut that's when I go Psycho like Norman Bates\nI wanna kill the devil for talkin' shit\nCause he can't get a taste of the chocolate\nAfrican breasts; cause white bitches have no butt and no chest\nBlack women have bodies like goddesses\nSorta like Venus, but put away your penis\nCause the devil is a savage motherfucker\nThat's why I'm lighter than the average brother\nCause you raped our women, and we felt it\nBut it'll never happen again if I can help it (me neither)\nCause nobody in my neighborhood has caught jungle fever yet\nSo horny little devil, you better listen\nBefore yo' ass come up missin'\nAnd it's like that\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow you wanna get me\nHorny little devil must be, a F-A-G\nTryin to fuck me out my land and my manhood\nHave me broke eatin' Spam, and canned goods\nLocking down on my neighborhoods\nTreat me less than a man cause right now you got the upper hand\nBut my ass is a virgin\nYou might have fucked the Indians\nBut you can't surgeon me\nAnd when I'm on top I won't be fuckin ya\nI'd rather put a buck in ya\nCause I hate the devil with a passion\nAnd when I see the whites of his eyes I start blastin'\nDig a hole and throw his ass in\nAnd I won't be happy till I'm down to my last ten\nGet his fuckin' pitchfork\nTie him up, and then feed the bitch pork\nLittle devil can't fuck me out my pay\nCause horny little devil true niggas ain't gay\nAnd you can't play with my Yo-Yo\nAnd definitely can't play with me you fuckin' homo\nCause we'll blow your head off\nAnd turn that white sheet, 'to a red cloth\nPlus when they're all dead\nI can cut that Jheri juice and get a bald head\nThen let it nap up\nGo down to the corner store and beat the Jap up\nClean all the crap up\nOut my city, now the whole block look shitty\nPut his dick on a wood block\nSwing swing swing, and chop chop chop\nNow who's the next to nut\nColor Me Badd, but you can't sex me up\nSo don't even try it, put your dick on a diet\nCause this is Watts Riot 1991 and I'ma get my gun\nPut an end to the devil, so get a fucking shovel\n\n(repeat chorus)"}}, {"title": "Jackin' For Beats", "album": "Kill at Will EP", "year": "1990-12-18", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nWait a minute, hold on, get your ass up\nWhassup nigga?\nGet over

minute, hey man\nWhassup?\nWait a minute?\nThere are police, go!\n\n[Verse 1]\nGive me that beat, fool, it's a full time jack move\nChilly Chill, yo homie make the track move\nAnd I'll jack any Tom, Dick and Hank\nThat's the name of the SUCKERS I done ganked\nI get away from a copper\nDrop a dime, I'll break you off somethin proper\nWith the L-E-N-C-H-M-O-B\nT-Bone and that's J-Dee\nAnd here's how we'll greet ya\nStop fool, come off that beat ya\nFeel dumb cause you're caught in the dark\n(ya lil nuttin ass mark)\nRaise up, cause you can't' have it back\nYou said - \"I ain't never got gaffled like that\"\nOff the end of the gat you choke\nShort Dog's in the house - \"Whattup loc?\"\nNuttin but a come up\nGimme that bass, and don't try to run up\nCause you'll get banked somethin sweet\nIce Cube and Da Lench Mob, is jackin for beats\n\n[Verse 2]\nHuh, and even if you're down with my crew\n*Yo Chuck man, I don't understand this man\nYou got to slow down*\nI jack them too\nAnd then we'll freak it\nKick that bass, and look what we did\nFade the grade, played, and made a few mil\nAnd I keep stealin\nIce Cube'll make it thump\nBut right about now - *let's get over the hump*\nBut I don't party and shake my butt\nI leave that to the brothers with the funny haircuts\nAnd it'll drive you nuts\nSteal your beat, and give it that gangsta touch\nLike jackin and mackin\nSay hi to the three fifty-seven I'm packin\nAnd it sounds so sweet\nIce Cube and Da Lench Mob, is jackin for beats\n\n[Verse 3]\nIce Cube, will take a funky beat and reshape it\nLocate a dope break, and then I break it\nAnd give it that gangsta lean\nDead in your face as I turn up the bass\nI make punk suckers run and duck because\nI don't try to hide cause you know that I love to\nJack a fool for his beat and then I'm outtie\nSo when I come to your town don't crowd me\nCause I know, you're gonna wanna kick it with me\nBut I know, none of y'all can get with me\nSo you think you're protected\nWell you are til you put a funky beat on a record\nThen I have to show and prove and use your groove\nCause suckers can't fade the Cube\nAnd if I jack you and you keep comin\nI'll have you marks a 100 Miles and Running!\n\n*stop stop stop stop stop!\nSa-prize, niggas*", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6c223fafae72a06b4952ce4b3f7e6b7a.992x991x1.jpg", "artist": "Ice Cube", "raw":

there... shit\nYa lil punk ass nigga\nC'mere, c'mere, c'mere boy\nGod damnit you stop that shit now\nTake him to jail and get him the hell from in front of this house\nNow wait a minute, wait a minute, hey man\nWhassup?\nWait a minute?\nThere are police, go!\n\n[Verse 1]\nGive me that beat, fool, it's a full time jack move\nChilly Chill, yo homie make the track move\nAnd I'll jack any Tom, Dick and Hank\nThat's the name of the SUCKERS I done ganked\nI get away from a copper\nDrop a dime, I'll break you off somethin proper\nWith the L-E-N-C-H-M-O-B\nT-Bone and that's J-Dee\nAnd here's how we'll greet ya\nStop fool, come off that beat ya\nFeel dumb cause you're caught in the dark\n(ya lil nuttin ass mark)\nRaise up, cause you can't' have it back\nYou said - \"I ain't never got gaffled like that\"\nOff the end of the gat you choke\nShort Dog's in the house - \"Whattup loc?\"\nNuttin but a come up\nGimme that bass, and don't try to run up\nCause you'll get banked somethin sweet\nIce Cube and Da Lench Mob, is jackin for beats\n\n[Verse 2]\nHuh, and even if you're down with my crew\n*Yo Chuck man, I don't understand this man\nYou got to slow down*\nI jack them too\nAnd then we'll freak it\nKick that bass, and look what we did\nFade the grade, played, and made a few mil\nAnd I keep stealin\nIce Cube'll make it thump\nBut right about now - *let's get over the hump*\nBut I don't party and shake my butt\nI leave that to the brothers with the funny haircuts\nAnd it'll drive you nuts\nSteal your beat, and give it that gangsta touch\nLike jackin and mackin\nSay hi to the three fifty-seven I'm packin\nAnd it sounds so sweet\nIce Cube and Da Lench Mob, is jackin for beats\n\n[Verse 3]\nIce Cube, will take a funky beat and reshape it\nLocate a dope break, and then I break it\nAnd give it that gangsta lean\nDead in your face as I turn up the bass\nI make punk suckers run and duck because\nI don't try to hide cause you know that I love to\nJack a fool for his beat and then I'm outtie\nSo when I come to your town don't crowd me\nCause I know, you're gonna wanna kick it with me\nBut I know, none of y'all can get with me\nSo you think you're protected\nWell you are til you put a funky beat on a record\nThen I have to show and prove and use your groove\nCause suckers can't fade the Cube\nAnd if I jack you and you keep comin\nI'll have you marks a 100 Miles and Running!\n\n*stop stop stop stop stop!\nSa-prize, niggas*"}}, {"title": "How to Survive in South Central", "album": "Death Certificate", "year": "1991-07-09", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nAnd now, the wonderous world of..\nHey, come to Los Angeles!\nWhere you and your family can have peace and tranquility\nEnjoy the refinement..\nHey Bone, hey nigga where you at though?\nHello, my name is Elaine\nAnd I'll be your tour guide through South Central Los Angeles\n\n[Verse 1: Ice Cube]\nHow to survive in South Central (what you do?)\nA place where bustin a cap is fundamental\nNo, you can't find the shit in a handbook\nTake a close look, at a rap crook\nRule number one: get yourself a gun\nA nine in your ass'll be fine\nKeep it in your glove compartment\nCause jackers (yo) they love to start shit\nNow if you're white you can trust the police\nBut if you're black they ain't nothin but beasts\nWatch out for the kill\nDon't make a false move and keep your hands on the steering wheel\nAnd don't get smart\nAnswer all questions, and that's your first lesson\nOn stayin alive\nIn South Central, yeah, that's how you survive\n\n[Break]\nHi, this is Elaine again\nAre you enjoying your stay in South Central Los Angeles?\nOr has somebody taken your things?\nHave you witnessed a driveby?\nOkay, make sure you have your camcorder ready\nTo witness the extracurricular activities on blacks by the police\nSo you and your family can enjoy this tape, over and over again\nThis is Los Angeles, this is Los Angeles\n\n[Verse 2: Ice Cube]\nRule number two: don't trust nobody\nEspecially a bitch, with a hooker's body\nCause it ain't nuttin but a trap\nAnd females'll get you jacked and kidnapped\nYou'll wind up dead\nJust to be safe don't wear no blue or red\nCause most niggas get got\nIn either L.A., Compton or Watts\nPissed off black human beings\nSo I think you better skip the sight-seeing\nAnd if you're nuttin but a mark\nMake sure that you're in before dark\nBut if you need some affection, mate\nMake sure the bitch ain't a Section 8\nCause if so that's a monkey-wrench ho\nAnd you won't survive in South Central\n\n[Break]\nNow you realize it's not all that it's cracked up to be\nYou realize that it's fucked up!\nIt ain't nothin like the shit you saw on TV\nPalm trees and blonde bitches?\nI'd advise to you to pack your shit and get the fuck on, punk motherfucker!\nAnd you'll get your ass straight smoked\nYo I wanna say whassup to DJ Chilly Chill, Sir Jinx\nAiy'yo Cube these motherfuckers don't know what time it is\nSo show these motherfuckers what's happenin'\nTell these motherfuckers, don't fuck around in South Central\nGod dammit!\n\n[Verse 3: Ice Cube]\nRule number three: don't get caught up\nCause niggas are doing anything that's thought up\nAnd they got a price\nOn everything from dope, to stolen merchandise\nWeed to sherm\nCause South Central L.A., is one big germ\nWaitin for a brother like you to catch a disease\nAnd start slangin ki's\nTo an undercover or the wrong brother\nAnd they'll smother, a out of town motherfucker\nSo don't take your life for granted\nCause it's the craziest place on the planet\nIn L.A., heroes don't fly through the sky of stars\nThey live behind bars\nSo everybody's doin' a little dirt\nAnd it's the youngsters puttin' in the most work\nSo be alert and stay calm\nAs you enter, the concrete Vietnam\nYou say, the strong survive\nShit, the strong even die, in South Central\n\n[Outro]\nYeah you bitches, you think I forgot about your ass you tramp-ass hoes?\nYou better watch out\nAnd for you so called baller-ass niggas, you know what time it is\nSouth Central ain't no joke\nGot to keep your gat at all times motherfuckers\nBetter keep one in the chamber and nine in the clip god dammit\nYou'll sho' get got, just like that\nThis ain't no joke motherfuckers\nNow I wanna send a shout-out to E-Dog, the engineer\nPuttin' his two cents in\n\nThis is Los

you at though?\nHello, my name is Elaine\nAnd I'll be your tour guide through South Central Los Angeles\n\n[Verse 1: Ice Cube]\nHow to survive in South Central (what you do?)\nA place where bustin a cap is fundamental\nNo, you can't find the shit in a handbook\nTake a close look, at a rap crook\nRule number one: get yourself a gun\nA nine in your ass'll be fine\nKeep it in your glove compartment\nCause jackers (yo) they love to start shit\nNow if you're white you can trust the police\nBut if you're black they ain't nothin but beasts\nWatch out for the kill\nDon't make a false move and keep your hands on the steering wheel\nAnd don't get smart\nAnswer all questions, and that's your first lesson\nOn stayin alive\nIn South Central, yeah, that's how you survive\n\n[Break]\nHi, this is Elaine again\nAre you enjoying your stay in South Central Los Angeles?\nOr has somebody taken your things?\nHave you witnessed a driveby?\nOkay, make sure you have your camcorder ready\nTo witness the extracurricular activities on blacks by the police\nSo you and your family can enjoy this tape, over and over again\nThis is Los Angeles, this is Los Angeles\n\n[Verse 2: Ice Cube]\nRule number two: don't trust nobody\nEspecially a bitch, with a hooker's body\nCause it ain't nuttin but a trap\nAnd females'll get you jacked and kidnapped\nYou'll wind up dead\nJust to be safe don't wear no blue or red\nCause most niggas get got\nIn either L.A., Compton or Watts\nPissed off black human beings\nSo I think you better skip the sight-seeing\nAnd if you're nuttin but a mark\nMake sure that you're in before dark\nBut if you need some affection, mate\nMake sure the bitch ain't a Section 8\nCause if so that's a monkey-wrench ho\nAnd you won't survive in South Central\n\n[Break]\nNow you realize it's not all that it's cracked up to be\nYou realize that it's fucked up!\nIt ain't nothin like the shit you saw on TV\nPalm trees and blonde bitches?\nI'd advise to you to pack your shit and get the fuck on, punk motherfucker!\nAnd you'll get your ass straight smoked\nYo I wanna say whassup to DJ Chilly Chill, Sir Jinx\nAiy'yo Cube these motherfuckers don't know what time it is\nSo show these motherfuckers what's happenin'\nTell these motherfuckers, don't fuck around in South Central\nGod dammit!\n\n[Verse 3: Ice Cube]\nRule number three: don't get caught up\nCause niggas are doing anything that's thought up\nAnd they got a price\nOn everything from dope, to stolen merchandise\nWeed to sherm\nCause South Central L.A., is one big germ\nWaitin for a brother like you to catch a disease\nAnd start slangin ki's\nTo an undercover or the wrong brother\nAnd they'll smother, a out of town motherfucker\nSo don't take your life for granted\nCause it's the craziest place on the planet\nIn L.A., heroes don't fly through the sky of stars\nThey live behind bars\nSo everybody's doin' a little dirt\nAnd it's the youngsters puttin' in the most work\nSo be alert and stay calm\nAs you enter, the concrete Vietnam\nYou say, the strong survive\nShit, the strong even die, in South Central\n\n[Outro]\nYeah you bitches, you think I forgot about your ass you tramp-ass hoes?\nYou better watch out\nAnd for you so called baller-ass niggas, you know what time it is\nSouth Central ain't no joke\nGot to keep your gat at all times motherfuckers\nBetter keep one in the chamber and nine in the clip god dammit\nYou'll sho' get got, just like that\nThis ain't no joke motherfuckers\nNow I wanna send a shout-out to E-Dog, the engineer\nPuttin' his two cents in\n\nThis is Los Angeles"}}, {"title": "What Can I Do?", "album": "Lethal Injection", "year": "1993-12-07", "lyrics": "[Intro: sampled announcer]\nIn any country, prison is where society sends it's failures.

Yes\nTook some advice from my Uncle Fester\nAll dressed up in polyester\nWelcome to McDonalds may I please help you?\nSh*t, what can I do?\n\nTadow...\n\n[Outro]\n\nThe white man has broke every law known to man to establish AmeriKKKa, but he'll put you in the state penitentary, he'll put you in the federal penitentary for breaking these same laws.

X2]\nNiggas want that gutter shit\nFuck that other shit, that play it for your mother shit\nAin't the rugged shit\n\n[Verse 1 Ice Cube]\nKeep it gangsta y'all, I want to thank you all\nNiggas comin' with that bullshit, it's gankin' y'all\nWe can ride to this kinda shit and bank them all\nNigga ball 'till you fall motherfucker thats all\nCan't none of y'all hang with me putin' in work\nTurn this motherfucker up unless you goin' to church\nNowadays, crazy ass bitches want they bills paid\nBut can't even make a good thang of kool-aid (ha ha)\nBut chicken heads get chicken feed (bahk bakh)\n(a) Lil' dick and weed (bahk bakh)\nEverything that a chicken need (bahk bakh)\nTryin' to pot I get real as Chris Rock\nMake a bitch hot, turn into Fort Knox (bitch know)\nIt's Ice Cube comin' straight from the gutter\nWestcoast Don, you fags undastata\n\n[Verse 2 Jay-O-Felony]\nThere is sa-lethal in the gas chamber\nI'm full of anger, nigga the west is in the house\nBut you still in for some danger\nAnd when I'm thru, I take your bitch and finger bang her\nBut if she looks tossed up, i'll slang her\nBeat you like mama dearest with a clothes hanger\nCuz the gang a niggas be tryin' to spit\nBut you can't spit it like this\nI come equiped to rip, any battle\nAnd leave him strung in his crew\nBut they put me in the twist like Trump\nI can collapse or puncture, the lungs of anyone\nGive him a chance to spit his last word, unerve\nThen he done\n20/20 ain't good enough\nRappers they ain't seein' me, this Jay-O Felony\nAnd nobody can stand three of me\nCaution keep MC's out of my reach, I'm on a mission\nAnd be gettin' to your fuckin' hide to be called a physician\nImmediately, I puts it down at a show (Jay-O)\nBut loked to choke the shit out a fool, nigga dat's on doo low\n\n[Bridge Ice Cube]\nKeep it gansta y'all, keep it gangsta (keep it gangsta)\nKeep it gansta y'all, keep it gangsta (keep it gangsta)\nKeep it gansta y'all, keep it gangsta (all my life)\nKeep it gansta y'all, keep it gangsta (all my life)\n\n[Verse 3 Ice Cube]\nI'm sick of these rap niggas lyin' 'bout they rich (what?)\nLyin' 'bout they bitch (what?)\nLyin' 'bout they dick (what?)\nI'm sick

kamekaze\nIlluminaughty, bitch hoes in they body\nWe the riders, we push like mahz-er-aties\nDo karatees, on hatters, and you hotties\nFuck the party, come on, my niggas focus\nWe the richest, pretend that we the brokest\nNiggas notice, as soon as you're checking quotas\nWe the coldest, so go and tell the rollers (biotch!)\n\n[Verse 4 Gangsta]\nWho dat? next out the game, in blue kahks\nGangsta's the name, niggas wonderin' how I do that\nBy the thug way, package and transportin' the drug way\nOnly means of makin' a livin', the Crip and Blood way\nI'm on grates when I'm grindin'\nI'm on stakes when I'm dinnin'\nAnd on sunday's on the wine\nIs you can't calm the savage beast (never)\nAnd I can make your birds rise like geese, K-Mac tell 'em\nYou sell 'em, I swell 'em, loke (sell 'em loke)\nHard or soft determines how much a nigga sell 'em for\nWe got the fish scale texture (fish scale)\nNow if you cook it yourself you get extras\nDub that shit to death with this dub thang\nOnly a few niggas left with this love mang\nSo we cop together (yeah), put it in the beeker\nRock together (uhh), claim blocks together\nAnd fuck cock together, nigga (brrrph!)\n\n[Ice Cube Hook X2]\nNiggas want that gutter shit\nFuck that other shit, that play it for your mother shit\nAin't the rugged shit\n\n[Squeek Rule]\n\n[Verse 5 Squeek Rule]\nLook in my eyes\nI see the dollar sign dogg, and my dick start to rise\nGot to handle money, got to stack the money (tell 'em)\nBuzzin' like a bee cuz I crave for the honey\nMillion dollar tickets make bitches look wicked\nSo you innocent hoes, ain't got to like ta kick it\nI know you knows (uhh), cuz now my decimals (yep)\nDone fiend for the green, keep you itchin' in your panty hose\nYour eyes full of gleem (brrrmmph!)\nYou wanna get on my team, and live my dream\nCaptain of the ship is what I'm boastin'\nHit the three wheel motion, I'm the shit when I'm coastin' (uh huh)\nDown the boulevard, flossin' hard\nLights hit the chrome, don't go lick 'em like a movie star\nMoney makes me a savage (what it do?)\nShit, I brake down the world for the cabbage (Squeek Rule)\n\n[Bridge Ice Cube]\nKeep it gansta y'all, keep it gangsta\nKeep it gansta y'all, keep it gangsta\nKeep it gansta y'all, keep it gangsta (all my life)\nKeep it gansta y'all, keep it gangsta (all my life)\n\n[Ice Cube Chrous X2]\nNiggas want that gutter shit\nFuck that

(Here come the big show)\nThey call me Hollywood (Here come the big show)\nLet a bitch know!\n\n[Verse]\nSee my nigga Snoop is always up in the coupe\nAnd my homeboy Dub you know I'm fuckin' with cuzz\nSee my nigga Game you know\nHe's running with bloods\nBoy you know the name Ice Cube\nShow me love\nMy homie $hort\nCatch him at the airport\nThat Crazy Toones always high as the moon\nThat nigga June he is the brother of Bone\nAnd he got a gun that's the color chrome\nSee my nigga Tony Draper always chasing the paper\nAnd he always keeping gangsta\nBitches catching the vapors\nSee my homie Starr\nYou might not know who he are\nHe in the club with his locs on up in the dark\nBoy that nigga Keeb\nGet whatever you need\nSee we call him Bo\nNigga check his M.O\nThese are the people I know\nThese are the places I go\nThis is my world muthafucka\nJust one big show\n\n[Hook]\n\nWhat you see muthafucka\nV.I.P muthafucka\nWhat you see muthafucka\nThis is my cousin BR\nHe's just like my right arm\nHe might fuck you with charm\nBut don't be alarmed\nThis is my nigga Big Hurk\nHe's just like an expert\nIn the business of hurt\nSee my nigga do work\nThat's my son Doughboy\nAnd if you get him annoyed\nHe might drop 'yo ass off\nAnd pull out his Droid\nOh My Goodness\nOMG is his brother\nCause of his ass\nI got to move from daughters to mothers\nLike Jinx always up in the pink\nSmell his finger and I bet that muthafucka will stink\nSee my homie Deion ain't fuckin' with no peon\nAnd that nigga Kobe you know he's going for 40\n\n[Bridge 2x]\nThese are the people I know\nThese are the places I go\nThis is my world muthafucka\nJust one big show\n\n[Hook]\n\nDo I know Denzel?\nYeah I know Samuel L\nI got love for Mike epps\nThat nigga funny as hell\nDid I talk to Dr.Dre?\nHave I seen MC Ren?\nEvery now and then please don't ask me again\nMe and Greenfield been down since '80\nI miss rolling in Mercedes with my homie K-Dee\nI put money on the books for my nigga J-Dee\nSee Shorty is a Muslim use to be crazy\nI ate dinner with Martin\nAnd had meetings with Magic\nChopped it up with 2Pac\nBefore it was a tragic\n\n[Bridge]\n\nThey call me Hollywood\nRed carpet\nV.I.P. bitch\nThey call me Hollywood\nComplimentary everything\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "Cave Bitch", "album": "Lethal Injection", "year": "1993-12-07", "lyrics": "[Intro: Dr. Khalid Muhammad]\nGive me a black goddess sister I can't resist her. No stringy haired, blonde hair, blue eyed, pale skinned buttermilk complexion. Grafted, recessive, depressive, ironing board backside straight up and straight down. No frills, no thrills, Miss six o'clock, subject to have the itch, mutanoid, caucazoid, white cave bitch...\n\nVerse One: Ice Cube\n\nEase back white bitch, I don't play that\nJust because I got on my L.A. hat\nStalkin' walking in my big black boots\nIs my jingle, now you want Mandingo\nBig, black and handsome\nI should hold your devil ass for ransome\nSorta like Patty Hearst, but I'll burst first bitch\nAnd you know what's worse\nI'm coming from the land where the choppers roam\nSo fuck you bitch and your Coppertone\nStringy hair - no derrier - frontin' and fakin' with your silicone pair\nDo I wanna fuck? Not hardly\nThat's kinda like Barbie fuckin' Bob Marley\nIt ain't gonna happen, I keep rappin'\nMotherfuck Tennille, but see I'm the Captain of this ship\nAnd I'm true to the game\nYa all look the same\nStandin' by my backstage door, hopin' that'll switch\nSpread out you little cave bitch\n\nVerse Two: Ice Cube\n\nWhy everytime we get famous\nYou wanna play us like Andy and Amos?\nThe devil sent you to try and tame us\nBut you can't tame me, with no bitch named Amy\nLookin' for the dark meat\nBut ho, I ain't tryin' to go out like Barkley\nCuz everytime I turn on the TV\nI see several brothers with she-devils\nSmilin' cuz you out on a date\nBut sooner or later, the bitch'll yell rape\nSoon as daddy found out you a jigaboo\nHe'll kill like he did Emmitt Till\nYah, he tried to kick bass\nBut the bitch probably threw it in his face\nSouthern Belle ain't nothin' but a trick\nNasty as hell, stanky little cave bitch\n\nVerse Three:\n\nNow don't think that I hate you\nCuz I won't date you, bitch I gotta stay true\nYou can be a fan, but don't expand\nAnd try to get my dick in your hand\nYou better run to the minute man\nPale as snow, so act like y'know\nCuz if I slap it, flip it, and rub it like that\nYeah, it gotta be black\nPlus yo ass too flat\nI need a butt big enough that can clap\nRat-a-tat-tat\nYou can't get mine ho\nI'd rather fuck an albino\nAtleast I know, she's comin' from the Nubian\nAnd not the Ku Klux Klan that you be in\nAnd I don't give a fuck if your family is rich\nYou're still a little cave bitch", "image":

No stringy haired, blonde hair, blue eyed, pale skinned buttermilk complexion. Grafted, recessive, depressive, ironing board backside straight up and straight down. No frills, no thrills, Miss six o'clock, subject to have the itch, mutanoid, caucazoid, white cave bitch...\n\nVerse One: Ice Cube\n\nEase back white bitch, I don't play that\nJust because I got on my L.A. hat\nStalkin' walking in my big black boots\nIs my jingle, now you want Mandingo\nBig, black and handsome\nI should hold your devil ass for ransome\nSorta like Patty Hearst, but I'll burst first bitch\nAnd you know what's worse\nI'm coming from the land where the choppers roam\nSo fuck you bitch and your Coppertone\nStringy hair - no derrier - frontin' and fakin' with your silicone pair\nDo I wanna fuck? Not hardly\nThat's kinda like Barbie fuckin' Bob Marley\nIt ain't gonna happen, I keep rappin'\nMotherfuck Tennille, but see I'm the Captain of this ship\nAnd I'm true to the game\nYa all look the same\nStandin' by my backstage door, hopin' that'll switch\nSpread out you little cave bitch\n\nVerse Two: Ice Cube\n\nWhy everytime we get famous\nYou wanna play us like Andy and Amos?\nThe devil sent you to try and tame us\nBut you can't tame me, with no bitch named Amy\nLookin' for the dark meat\nBut ho, I ain't tryin' to go out like Barkley\nCuz everytime I turn on the TV\nI see several brothers with she-devils\nSmilin' cuz you out on a date\nBut sooner or later, the bitch'll yell rape\nSoon as daddy found out you a jigaboo\nHe'll kill like he did Emmitt Till\nYah, he tried to kick bass\nBut the bitch probably threw it in his face\nSouthern Belle ain't nothin' but a trick\nNasty as hell, stanky little cave bitch\n\nVerse Three:\n\nNow don't think that I hate you\nCuz I won't date you, bitch I gotta stay true\nYou can be a fan, but don't expand\nAnd try to get my dick in your hand\nYou better run to the minute man\nPale as snow, so act like y'know\nCuz if I slap it, flip it, and rub it like that\nYeah, it gotta be black\nPlus yo ass too flat\nI need a butt big enough that can clap\nRat-a-tat-tat\nYou can't get mine ho\nI'd rather fuck an albino\nAtleast I know, she's comin' from the Nubian\nAnd not the Ku Klux Klan that you be in\nAnd I don't give a fuck if your family is rich\nYou're still a little cave bitch"}}, {"title": "Color Blind", "album": "Death Certificate", "year": "1991-10-29", "lyrics": "[Ice Cube]\nHere's another day at the stoplight\nI'm lookin' in my mirror so I can see who can see me\nSouth Central is puttin Ice Cube to the test\nWith four brothers in the SS\nI can't go around and can't back up\nSo I gotta peep game layin' in the cut\nIs this a jack or a kidnap?\nSince I'm never ever slippin', I'm fully strapped\nI grab my gat out the glove\nDo these fools got a problem with me, or do they got love?\nAnd when the light turn green, I don't bone out\nI wanna see what these black men are all about\nCause if it's my time, I'm just short\nIf not, I'm pluggin they Super Sport\nFirst they get behind my ride\nThen they switch lanes to the left side\nI'm scopin' out the one smokin' indo\nComin' up fast, rollin' down his window\nHe threw up a sign, I put away my nine\nFool, cause I'm color blind\n\n[Threat]\nKilla Cali, the state where they kill\nOver colors cuz brothas don't know the deal\nAnd they'll cap you, not if they have to\nBut if they want to, first they might confront you\nBut every nigga on my block can't stop\nAnd he won't stop and he don't stop\nNot to the bang bang boogie, but they like to gangbang\nAnd rookies ain't the only ones that drop\nSome say the little locs are gettin a little too loc'ed\nAnd when it comes to dust, they kick up the most\nSay the wrong word\nThen whistle down the street to your homies like a bird\nBust a u-turn, come back and get served nigga\nFor the women, it don't matter how loud they blouse get\nBut men, the wrong color outfit, could get your mouth split\nIt's a shame, but it ain't no thang to me\nCuz I slang these thangs like a G\nIt's on, is anybody killin' for the summertime\nI gotta get another nine, even though I'm colorblind\n\n[KAM]\nI'm fresh outta county on bail\nAnd no sooner do I get out, seems like I'm right back in jail\nFor some gang related activity\nCuz everyday, different fools try to get with me\nFor no more than a color, or territory\nCan't rehabilitate 'em, that's the sheriff's story\nSo what's left, the judge goes deaf\nWhen you try to tell your side\nAnd you ain't blue eyed\nBoy you better duck cuz the book is comin'\nAnd just hand your car keys over to your woman\nBecause it ain't no sunshine where you headed\nAnd the shit'll drive you crazy if you let it\nBut now, I got time to think\nBecause they hit me with everything but the kitchen sink\nAnd I ain't even shed a tear\nCuz believe it or not, they got more love for me here\nNow picture that, but on a black and white photograph\nCuz brothas, you don't know the half\nOn the streets I was damn near outta my mind\nBut ever since I've been down\nI'm colorblind\n\n[WC]\nNow here's the game plan, yo, at a quarter to nine\nI was told to peel a cap on the other side\nYo, Young and dumb and full of cum, I\u2019m a baby loc\nI gotta put in work for the hood and that ain't no joke\n\n[Coolio]\nStable and able but I'm not ready and willin'\nCuz I'm only 13 and I ain't never did a killin'\nGrabbed the A.K. and jumped in the G ride\nStarted up the bucket and headed for the other side\n\n[WC]\nYo, spotted the enemies, now I'm on a creep tip\nHit the 5 dollar stick and I put in my clip\n\n[Coolio]\nSo, I jumped out the car and no matter what the cost\nI had my mind set on sendin niggas to Harrison Ross\n\n[WC]\nCaught one from the back and I looked in eyes\nThinkin' should I peel his cap, or should I let him survive\nYo, I'm trapped in the plan designed by another side\n\n[Coolio]\nI ain't contributin to genocide (why?)\nCause I'm colorblind\n\n[King Tee]\nNiggas in the hood ain't changed\nAnd I've finally figure out that we're not in the same gang\nCuz, I walk the alleys of Compton with nowhere to turn\nEvery which way I get burned.\nBaby Lou wears blue, Big Fred wears red\nPut 'em together and we color 'em dead\nDead, dyin, gettin smoked's like part of the fun\nThey get smoked just to show how many come to the funeral\n\n[J-Dee (Lench Mob)]\nI understand how all my homeboys feel\nCuz I been shot; to this day, I pack my steel\nCuz I was born in a certain territory\nWhere you don't talk only the streets tell stories\nWith blue and red bandanas on the street\nAnd if you slippin, you'll be six feet deep\nCuz me and T-bone, we pay it no mind\nAnd for the rest of the mob, we stay color blind", "image":

me\nSouth Central is puttin Ice Cube to the test\nWith four brothers in the SS\nI can't go around and can't back up\nSo I gotta peep game layin' in the cut\nIs this a jack or a kidnap?\nSince I'm never ever slippin', I'm fully strapped\nI grab my gat out the glove\nDo these fools got a problem with me, or do they got love?\nAnd when the light turn green, I don't bone out\nI wanna see what these black men are all about\nCause if it's my time, I'm just short\nIf not, I'm pluggin they Super Sport\nFirst they get behind my ride\nThen they switch lanes to the left side\nI'm scopin' out the one smokin' indo\nComin' up fast, rollin' down his window\nHe threw up a sign, I put away my nine\nFool, cause I'm color blind\n\n[Threat]\nKilla Cali, the state where they kill\nOver colors cuz brothas don't know the deal\nAnd they'll cap you, not if they have to\nBut if they want to, first they might confront you\nBut every nigga on my block can't stop\nAnd he won't stop and he don't stop\nNot to the bang bang boogie, but they like to gangbang\nAnd rookies ain't the only ones that drop\nSome say the little locs are gettin a little too loc'ed\nAnd when it comes to dust, they kick up the most\nSay the wrong word\nThen whistle down the street to your homies like a bird\nBust a u-turn, come back and get served nigga\nFor the women, it don't matter how loud they blouse get\nBut men, the wrong color outfit, could get your mouth split\nIt's a shame, but it ain't no thang to me\nCuz I slang these thangs like a G\nIt's on, is anybody killin' for the summertime\nI gotta get another nine, even though I'm colorblind\n\n[KAM]\nI'm fresh outta county on bail\nAnd no sooner do I get out, seems like I'm right back in jail\nFor some gang related activity\nCuz everyday, different fools try to get with me\nFor no more than a color, or territory\nCan't rehabilitate 'em, that's the sheriff's story\nSo what's left, the judge goes deaf\nWhen you try to tell your side\nAnd you ain't blue eyed\nBoy you better duck cuz the book is comin'\nAnd just hand your car keys over to your woman\nBecause it ain't no sunshine where you headed\nAnd the shit'll drive you crazy if you let it\nBut now, I got time to think\nBecause they hit me with everything but the kitchen sink\nAnd I ain't even shed a tear\nCuz believe it or not, they got more love for me here\nNow picture that, but on a black and white photograph\nCuz brothas, you don't know the half\nOn the streets I was damn near outta my mind\nBut ever since I've been down\nI'm colorblind\n\n[WC]\nNow here's the game plan, yo, at a quarter to nine\nI was told to peel a cap on the other side\nYo, Young and dumb and full of cum, I\u2019m a baby loc\nI gotta put in work for the hood and that ain't no joke\n\n[Coolio]\nStable and able but I'm not ready and willin'\nCuz I'm only 13 and I ain't never did a killin'\nGrabbed the A.K. and jumped in the G ride\nStarted up the bucket and headed for the other side\n\n[WC]\nYo, spotted the enemies, now I'm on a creep tip\nHit the 5 dollar stick and I put in my clip\n\n[Coolio]\nSo, I jumped out the car and no matter what the cost\nI had my mind set on sendin niggas to Harrison Ross\n\n[WC]\nCaught one from the back and I looked in eyes\nThinkin' should I peel his cap, or should I let him survive\nYo, I'm trapped in the plan designed by another side\n\n[Coolio]\nI ain't contributin to genocide (why?)\nCause I'm colorblind\n\n[King Tee]\nNiggas in the hood ain't changed\nAnd I've finally figure out that we're not in the same gang\nCuz, I walk the alleys of Compton with nowhere to turn\nEvery which way I get burned.\nBaby Lou wears blue, Big Fred wears red\nPut 'em together and we color 'em dead\nDead, dyin, gettin smoked's like part of the fun\nThey get smoked just to show how many come to the funeral\n\n[J-Dee (Lench Mob)]\nI understand how all my homeboys feel\nCuz I been shot; to this day, I pack my steel\nCuz I was born in a certain territory\nWhere you don't talk only the streets tell stories\nWith blue and red bandanas on the street\nAnd if you slippin, you'll be six feet deep\nCuz me and T-bone, we pay it no mind\nAnd for the rest of the mob, we stay color blind"}}, {"title": "Really Doe", "album": "Lethal Injection", "year": "1993-12-07", "lyrics": "[Intro]\n*Gun shot* \"Ain't nobody talkin when I'm talkin fellas so shut

up in my motherfuckin uhh..\nChuck Taylors, Knick kickers, Wallabee's\nOn my ass I got the umm.. um.. khakis, 501's\nOn my back I got the uhh.. sweatshirt\nYou know, with the fat three creases\nUhh, my t-shirt, Slingshot, uhh.. khaki shirt\nUmm, and I got the Cake cutter in my\u2014in my pocket\nUhh, got the afro, the braids\nMotherfuckin uhh, rollers\n\"You got to believe in somethin\"\nAnd I just ask my motherfuckin self, uhh\n\"Why not believe in me?\"\n\n[Verse 1]\nTo G or not to G, is the question\nAnd like Smith told Wesson\nI'm shady with the .380 old school diploma\nI'll leave that ass in a coma, so\nIf you got a herringbone, Welcome to the Terrordome\nTwo-eleven, sorry Reverend\nOh my god, gettin robbed\nReach for the smog, \"Atomic Dog\"\nHard to swallow, janky as Rollo\nCount to ten, and don't try to follow\nCause just like Waco, I can take fo'\nATF, to they death\nBust a left on Western, go and get a room\nDon't want to be a felon like Stacey Koon\nGet the right bitch, hit the light switch, here we go\nTap that ass like this - really doe\n\n[Hook]\n\"You got to believe, somethin..\"\nWest Side Lynch Mob\n\"I got to believe in me..\"\nCause I'm a motherfuckin G\nCause I'm a mother-fuckin..\n{\"And who the fuck are you?\"}\n\n[Verse 2]\nThirty in a holdin tank, catch the vapors\nMake me a pillow out of toilet paper\nConcrete bench kickin' off the hemorrhoids;\nEses deep, don't fuck with dem boys\nPhone check, collect call from the baller\nHer mama said please don't call her\nDo-Wah-Diddy, far from New Jack City\nSeen one of my peers, \"What the fuck you doin in here?\"\nHe said, \"One-eighty-seven on the enemy\nAnd they treat me like I just shot a Kennedy!\"\nDeputy bitch thinks she's the Queen Bee\nInk on my thumb, index, and

pulled out a gat\nI knew it was a caper\nI said, \"Please don't kill my mother\", so he raped her\nTied me up, took me outside\nAnd I was thrown in a big truck\nAnd it was packed like sardines\nFull

floors\nSo bitch you can fight your own wars\nSo if you see a man in red white and blue\nGettin' chased by the Lench Mob crew\nIt's a man who deserves to buckle\nI wanna kill Sam cause he ain't my

survive in life\nWe'll help you to be the best soldier in the U.S. of A\nBecause we do more before 7 A.M than most niggers do in their whole lifetime\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm comin!, I'm comin!\nI'm comin!, I'm comin!\n\n[Verse 1]\nI wanna kill him, cause he tried to play me like the trick\nBut you see, I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with\nI got the A to the motherfuckin K, and it's ready to rip\nSlapped in my banana clip\nAnd I'm lookin'\nIs he in Watts, Oakland, Philly or Brooklyn?\nIt seems like he got the whole country behind him\nSo it's sort of hard to find him\nBut when I do, gotta put my gat in his mouth\nPump seventeen rounds make his brains hang out\nCause the shit he did was uncalled for\nTried to fuck a brother up the ass like a small whore\nAnd that shit ain't fly\nSo now I'm settin up, the ultimate drive-by\nAnd when you hear this shit\nIt make the world say \"DAMN!\", \"I wanna kill Sam.\"\n\n\"Do the niggas run this moth-er-fuck-er?\" (repeat

in life is life (uh-huh, uh-huh)\nGet your mind right, and get your grind right (we gotta keep goin)\nHey young thugs (we gotta keep goin)\nGet your mind right, and get your grind right\nHey young thugs..\nGet your mind right, and get your grind right\n\n[Verse 1: Ice Cube]\nLook into my eyes if you wanna know me\nBefore you hypnotized, homey what do you see\nA figure that's just a little bigger than dealers\nA hustler countin figures ain't pulled no triggers\nCan you dig us, we be the ultimate lick\nWe's the hitters, that make the ultimate hits\nKinda floss-ey, kinda boss-ey\nIt's gotta be done my way, do what the {fuck} I say\nTop of the pyramid, homey what I tell you\nIf you leave this Westside umbrella you hit the cellar\nBring me my slippers, black robe, and my globe\nAnd I could rule the world with my eyes closed\n(with my eyes closed..)\n\n[Chorus: Krayzie Bone & Ice Cube]\nSee the mission's to get what we don't got\nUntil we filthy rich and on top\nYou betta go get it, it's yours\nNigga the mission's to get what you don't got\nThe struggle it don't stop until we drop\nSee the mission's to get what we don't got\nUntil we filthy rich and on top\nYou betta go get it, it's yours\nNigga the mission's to get what you don't got\nThe struggle it don't stop until we drop\nKrazyie Bone and Ice Cube\n\n[Verse 2: Ice Cube]\nTo all the little homies that's watchin TV\nI see you tryin to be a O.G. like me\nChasin dreams, pullin mo' schemes for wealth\nBut the best thing in life is health, be yourself playa\nTelevision it'll keep yo' ass wishin forever\nYou'll never get you life together\nDon't talk about death, I got too much life to live\nToo many orders to give -- what it is, showbiz\nTaught you what a trick and a ho is (WHAT?)\nShowed you what a Six-ty Fo' is (WHAT?)\nLord knows, \"In God We Trust\"\nAnd everybody in the world wanna be like us (everybody)\n\n[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]\nSee the mission's to get what we don't got\nUntil we filthy rich and on top\nYou betta go get it, it's yours\nNigga the mission's to get what you don't got\nThe struggle it don't stop until we drop\nSee the mission's to get what we don't got\nUntil we filthy rich and on top\nYou betta go get it, it's yours\nNigga the mission's to get what you don't got\nThe struggle it don't stop until we drop\n\n[Verse 3: Ice Cube]\nTo the kids of the world that's waitin for wealth\nWaitin for health, you better do for self\nHomey that's yo' last cup\nForget about the fast buck; boy, get you ass up\nPeople use yo' brain to gain\nDo something that ain't never been done; and we can spend hun's\nWipe our ass with twenties, light our joints with ones\nThrow away the guns, have nuttin but fun\nAnd homey we could do that {shit}!\nPolice have a fit, when yo' paper's legit\nWe gotta get off the phone, we gotta teach our own\nSend your baby to school and she'll come back grown\nWe got to talk to our grandma's\nAnd she'll help us through them dark halls, and them pitfalls\nEverybody know we got the world to gain\nWe got to stop the pain, Lord stop the rain\n\n[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]\nSee the mission's to get what we don't got\nUntil we filthy rich and on top\nYou betta go get it, it's yours\nNigga the mission's to get what you don't got\nThe struggle it don't stop until we drop\nSee the mission's to get what we don't got\nUntil we filthy rich and on top\nYou betta go get it, it's yours\nNigga the mission's to get what you don't got\nThe struggle it don't stop until we drop\n\n[Outro: Ice Cube & Krayzie Bone]\nKeep goin, little homey why you slowin?\nKeep rollin, little homey why you slowin?\nKeep rollin, little homey why you slowin?\nKeep rollin, rollin, rollin, rollin\nHey young thugs, the world is yours..\nHey young thugs, the world is yours..\nHey young thugs, the world is yours..\nYeah young thug, the world is yours..\nHey young thugs, the world is yours..\nHey young thugs, the world is yours..\nHey young thugs, the world is yours..\n(get your mind right, and get your grind right)\nYeah young thug, the world is yours..\nHey young thugs, the world is yours..

Flavor Flav]\nWell two peas in a bucket\nMother motherfuck it\nYou either Flavor Flav it\nOr you Chuck Chuck Chuck it\nKiss my ass and suck the D.I.C.-\nK. stands for kill so don't fuck with me\nI fucked that lady in the bed\nI missed that pussy and the butt was spread\nI tried it again in a thumping wagon\nThe bottom fell out and her ass started dragging\nTried it again in a field of grass\nI missed that pussy and I bust my ass\nThen I fucked this lady in the tree\nThe baby came out and said \"Run-DMC\"\n\nYeah, and you don't stop\nFlavor Flav in the house, and you don't stop\nIce Cube's in the house, and you don't stop\nHey, my sugar (Hey, yo, rock that shit G!)\n\n[Verse 2: Ice Cube]\nI knew this girl who looked just like you\nLight brown and a fly hairdo\nI wanted to do her, screw her\nSo I stepped to her on key\nBitch had more ass than a donkey\nI said you're the type of girl that I can't pass over\nGive me one chance and I'll bend your ass over\nJust call me the plumber at the end of the night\nCause a nigga like me'll lay plenty of pipe\nShe didn't get offended it was splendid to me\nCause mister nice guy is what I pretended to be\nI guess I'll just wine her and dine her\nAnd by the end of the night I'll be behind her\nWaxing that ass like Raindance\nOn the bumper get the pussy then I dump her\nTook her to the Comfort Inn, tucked her in\nPulled out the third leg pumped it in\nShe said 'Will you call me?'\nYeah, I'll call you a bitch or a ho after I ball you\nNaw I'm just playin' but it's still the same\nCause a nigga like Ice Cube is only out for one thang\n\n[Outro: both]\nFF: Yeah, what you out for?\nIC: Yo, I'm only out for one thing\nFF: You out for what, man?\nIC: Yo, I'm out for the pussy, the money, and the mic, and I'm straight. What are we out for?\nFF: I pledge allegiance to the uh... to the fuckin', all of that shit. Know what I'm saying?\nIC: Five thousand!\nFF: Five thousand, G\nIC: We out\nFF: Yo, we out of here, five thousand\nYo, this is for my boy Ice Cube, you know what I'm saying\nYo, check this out"}}, {"title": "That New Funkadelic", "album": "Everythang's Corrupt", "year": "2018-12-04", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nCalifornia\n\n[Chorus: Ice Cube]\nYou know the beat so sweet like booty meat (So sweet)\nYou know the beat so sweet like booty meat (Like booty meat)\nYou know the beat so sweet like booty meat (Hahahaha)\nYou know the beat so sweet like booty meat\nNo matter who you meet, you can move your feet\n\n[Bridge: Ice Cube]\nCome through bumpin' that new funkadelic, that new funkadelic\nCome through bumpin' that new funkadelic, that new funkadelic\nIce Cube got that new funkadelic, that new funkadelic\nIce Cube got that new funkadelic, better run, go tell it\n\n[Verse 1: Ice Cube]\nGot a uncle name George, horny muthafucka always down to orge\nFreaky muthafucka wanna Georgie Porg'\nTreat a big booty like a smorgasbord\n\n[Bridge: Ice Cube]\nFreaks on the floor, freaks on the floor\nHow many of y'all freaks on the low?\nFreaks on the floor, freaks on the floor\nHow many of y'all freaks on the low?

mentality, movie after movie\nCain't get it out of me, who wanna battle me?\nMouth is a Uzi, I thumbtack your ass\nTo the concrete, treat you like a floozy\nThe pyroclastic flow, that I lay\nWill turn this fuckin booth to Pompeii\nNow what will I do in broad day?\nI turn Broadway, into a hallway\nMotherfuckers want to know the herbs and spices\nThey come to me and want to know what my advice is\nI'm spiritual nigga, like Jesus Christ is\nAnd lyrical bitch, I'm 'bout the nicest\nContent, longevity, plus I spit shit\nThat sit on your brain nigga heavily\nI can do this shit 'til I'm seventy\nOn the Vegas Strip, yeah there I'll be\n\n[Hook]\nThis world (this world) so trife (so trife)\nYour money or your life\nKeep yo' kids, keep yo' wife\nMoney or your life (give it up)\nThis world, so trife (so trife)\nYour money or your life (you know~!)\nKeep yo' kids, keep yo' wife\nMoney or your life\n\n[Ice Cube]\nNow I get that money, make that cheddar\nPlay a double header, we can do better\nYou can get wetter, blown out your sweater\nSo much game need Dick Bavetta\nNow Helen Keller, can read this letter\nTwenty-third space if you read alphabeta\nI'm a go getter, youse a pointsetta\nPointin at me like you got a vendetta\nBoy you know better! They used to call me\nCube the Impaler, ask Jerry Heller\nYou the kind of fella that look for Cinderella\nI'm the kind of fella that steal her umbrella\nNow this ain't a diss, don't tell Roc-a-Fella\nAnd don't exercise the ghost of Makaveli\nBut I just got to be the best storyteller\nI tuck Slick Rick in with this acapella\nAsk Yella\n\n[Hook]\nThis world, so trife\nYour money or your life (grand wizard)\nKeep yo' kids, keep yo' wife\nMoney or your life\nThis world (this world) so trife (so trife)\nYour money or your life (gotta have it)\nKeep yo' kids (uhh) keep yo' wife (c'mon!)\nMoney or your life\n\n[Ice Cube]\nOMG, is down with us\nDoughboy, is down with us\nDub C, is down with us\nCrazy Toones, is down with us\nSnoop Dogg, is down with us\nWarren G, is down with us\nIce-T, is down with us\nDr. Dre, is down with us\nMC Ren, is down with us\nBad Lucc, is down with us\nDaz Dillinger is down with us\nYoung Kurupt is down with us\nMaylay, is down with us\nSuave House, is down with us\nKing Tee, is down with us\nThe Game, is down with us\n\n[Hook: repeat to fade]\nThis world, so trife\nYour money or your life\nKeep yo' kids, keep yo' wife\nMoney or your

gonna dedicate this to the pretty young ladies\nYou know, them pretty young ladies that wouldn't give us the play before the album, this is for you\n\n[Mashup]\n\n[Verse 1]\n[IC]\nWomen, they're good for nothing, no maybe one thing\nTo serve needs to my ding-a-ling\nI'm a man who loves the one-night stand\nCause after I do ya, huh, I never knew ya\nCause to kick it man it gives me the fits\nThey wanna lay with they nose under your armpits\nIce Cube won't wait so give it up cow\nAfter we do it you can go home now (see ya!)\nI'm a brother with a big long...\n(Come on, wait, what the hell you think you talkin' about?)\n\n[YY]\nFirst of all let me tell you my name, it's Yo-Yo\nAnd downing a girl, first offense, and that's a no-no\nYo-Yo thinks the kitchen sink should be thrown in\nNiggas be scheming and fiending to stick the bone in (yep)\nNo, Yo-Yo's not a ho or a whore\nAnd if that's what you're here for, exit through the door, there's more\nTo see of me but you're blind so\nWomen like me are fading brothers in the 9-0\n(Wait, first of all  how you gon' come on my record and talk?)\nI'm tryna say all women are superior over men\n(Yeah yeah)\nBut wait how you gon rule the world when you broke as a joke?\n(With yo county check baby)\n\n[IC]\nAy what up, buttercupper Miss Yo-Yo (that's me)\nI know you like to rap and like to flow so\nBut when it comes to hip-hop this is a man's world\nStay down and play the playground you little girl\n\n[YY]\nWhat you're saying I don't consider it as rapping\nCause you're a rerun and I'm the new what's-happening\nIt never fails, I'll always get respect\nAnd you lose, so take a rain check\n\n[IC]\nHell no cause you know that I'm first and you're second\nIf it wasn't for me, you'd probably be pregnant\nAnd barefoot, complaining that your back is aching\nShaking and faking while I'm bringing home the bacon\n\n[YY]\nWell you're mistaken, it's not going that far\nI make brothers like you play the backyard\nYou used to flow with the title but I took it\nBring home the bacon but find another ho to cook it\n\n[IC]\nDamn it lookit, cause you're talking a lot of bull\n\n[YY]\nWell I'm not your puppet so don't even try to pull\n\n[IC]\nThis is a man's world thank you very much\n\n[YY]\nBut it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch\n\n[Hook]\nThis, this is, this is a man's world\nThis, this is, this is a man's world\nThis, this is, this is a man's world\nThis is a man's world\n\n[Verse 2]\n[IC]\nAh Miss Yo-Yo, so what gives?\nI hear females always talking about Women's Lib\nWell get your own crib, and stay there\nInstead of having more babies for the welfare\nCause if you don't I'll label you a gold digger\nThe name is Ice Cube you know that I ain't the nigga\nFor you to look at when your hair get nappy\nSo take a piece of the pole and be happy\n\n[YY]\nHell no, because to me you're not a thriller\nYou come in the room with your three-inch killer\nThinking you can do damage to my backbone\nLeave your child in the yard until it's full-grown\nI'm a put it like this my man\nWithout us your hand would be your best friend\nSo give us credit like you know you should\nIf I don't look good, you don't look good\n\n[IC]\nI doubt it baby cause we're still most dominant\n\n[YY]\nBut you don't know how funky that I can get\n\n[IC]\nThis is a man's world thank you very much\n\n[YY]\nBut it wouldn't be a damn

a man's world\nThis, this is, this is a man's world\n\n[Verse 3]\n[IC]\nMan, women, I put a lot of fear in em\n(Why is that?)\nCause I had it up to here with em\nDrink a beer with em? No way\nCause I can only deal with em about an hour every day\nYeah if you know what I mean baby\n\n[YY]\nWell I guess, now that I think about it I think maybe\nIf you was more of a man instead of faking it\nWomen deserve the credit when they're making it\n\n[IC]\nYeah so what's the problem?\n\n[YY]\nWell I think we solved it\nI know they know the best male from who's doggin it\n\n[IC]\nYeah I admit you can flow\n\n[YY]\nWell that's true\n\n[IC]\nBut you see I'm a pro with the bank too\n\n[YY]\nYeah I can see you got it good\n\n[IC]\nOh that I know\n\n[YY]\nBut you see you're not better than Yo-Yo\nThe brand-new intelligent black lady\n\n[IC]\nYou're kinda dope but you still can't fade me\n\n[YY]\nSo what up then?\n\n[IC]\nGirl, what you tryna do?\n\n[YY]\nTo prove a black woman like me can bring the funk through\n\n[IC]\nThis is a man's world thank you very much\n\n[YY]\nBut it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch\n\n[IC]\nOr a big butt...\n\n[Hook]\nThis, this is, this is a man's world\nThis, this is, this is a man's world\nThis, this is, this is a man's world\nThis is a man's world\nThis, this is, this is a man's world\nThis, this is, this is a man's world\nThis, this is, this is a man's world\nThis is a man's world\nThis, this is, this is a man's world\nThis, this is, this is a man's world\nThis, this is, this is a man's world\nThis is a man's world\nThis, this is, this is a man's world\nThis, this is, this is a man's world\nThis, this is, this is a man's world\nThis is a man's world", "image": "https://images.genius.com/daba771488301f2341dbce49714b74d7.635x635x1.jpg", "artist": "Ice Cube", "raw": {"annotation_count": 24, "api_path": "/songs/22935", "apple_music_id": "1005221911", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/22935/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "Ice Cube, a self-styled sexist gangsta rapper, is met with his opposite in the form of Yo-Yo, \u201cthe brand new intelligent black lady.\u201d This was her first ever track, and the beginning of a prolific career.\n\nHere they trade bars and debate the place of women in hip-hop and the hood.

"[Intro]\n[Ice Cube]\nWomen, they're good for -\n\nWait wait wait wait, Cube, trip this\nWe gonna dedicate this to the pretty young ladies\nYou know, them pretty young ladies that wouldn't give us the play before the album, this is for you\n\n[Mashup]\n\n[Verse 1]\n[IC]\nWomen, they're good for nothing, no maybe one thing\nTo serve needs to my ding-a-ling\nI'm a man who loves the one-night stand\nCause after I do ya, huh, I never knew ya\nCause to kick it man it gives me the fits\nThey wanna lay with they nose under your armpits\nIce Cube won't wait so give it up cow\nAfter we do it you can go home now (see ya!)\nI'm a brother with a big long...\n(Come on, wait, what the hell you think you talkin' about?)\n\n[YY]\nFirst of all let me tell you my name, it's Yo-Yo\nAnd downing a girl, first offense, and that's a no-no\nYo-Yo thinks the kitchen sink should be thrown in\nNiggas be scheming and fiending to stick the bone in (yep)\nNo, Yo-Yo's not a ho or a whore\nAnd if that's what you're here for, exit through the door, there's more\nTo see of me but you're blind so\nWomen like me are fading brothers in the 9-0\n(Wait, first of all  how you gon' come on my record and talk?)\nI'm tryna say all women are superior over men\n(Yeah yeah)\nBut wait how you gon rule the world when you broke as a joke?\n(With yo county check baby)\n\n[IC]\nAy what up, buttercupper Miss Yo-Yo (that's me)\nI know you like to rap and like to flow so\nBut when it comes to hip-hop this is a man's world\nStay down and play the playground you little girl\n\n[YY]\nWhat you're saying I don't consider it as rapping\nCause you're a rerun and I'm the new what's-happening\nIt never fails, I'll always get respect\nAnd you lose, so take a rain check\n\n[IC]\nHell no cause you know that I'm first and you're second\nIf it wasn't for me, you'd probably be pregnant\nAnd barefoot, complaining that your back is aching\nShaking and faking while I'm bringing home the bacon\n\n[YY]\nWell you're mistaken, it's not going that far\nI make brothers like you play the backyard\nYou used to flow with the title but I took it\nBring home the bacon but find another ho to cook it\n\n[IC]\nDamn it lookit, cause you're talking a lot of bull\n\n[YY]\nWell I'm not your puppet so don't even try to pull\n\n[IC]\nThis is a man's world thank you very much\n\n[YY]\nBut it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch\n\n[Hook]\nThis, this is, this is a man's world\nThis, this is, this is a man's world\nThis, this is, this is a man's world\nThis is a man's world\n\n[Verse 2]\n[IC]\nAh Miss

treat me like the Pope man\nGhetto spokesman, I know niggas\nIn Eastside Oakland all the way to Brook-lyn\nAnd they love my shitty drawers, what you smokin?\nThink you got the balls, nigga I'm a Trojan\nCatchin all that just like a prophylac'\nDon't reproduce, that bullshit is whack\nFlavor Flav with a white bitch that is whack\nGot to put the nigga back in my Cadillac\nTake him to the hood, where it's action packed\nLet him know that the target's still on his back\nIt's a hustle called capitalism\nGot my niggas in prison, all stuck in the system yeah\nRecognize who's a hustler, George Dubya\nHe's the one that's sittin back, fuckin ya\nWith a big dick stuck in ya\nI'm from a place where the fuckin Terminator is the Governor\n\n(I got a Public Pretender.. tryin to make me a winner)\n(Nigga please don't surrender.. they'll have you for dinner)\n\n[Hook: Ice Cube]\nThe ghetto is a nigga trap, take the cheese\nSoon as you do it here come the police\nInvented and designed fo' us to fail\nWhere you gon' end up, dead or in jail\n\n[Ice Cube]\nYou only got two places\nState of California, got two faces\nMotherfuckin devils, get straight racist\nWhen they get you in them lonely dark places\nConcrete slave ships, never move\nWhere niggas like us get used like a mule\nDon't let 'em catch you, arrest you\nStrip and undress you, throw you in a cesspool\nYou wanna know the crime of the century\nA ghetto elementary, a mental penitentiary\nBlack man, you never been friend of me\nBoy you kin to me, why we enemies?\nThe ghe-tto is a trap\nFuck where you from, nigga look where you at\nWhere you wanna be? Point it out on a map\nDon't be scared to leave homey, we can come back\nIf you wanna come back to this bullshit\nMost of it comin straight out the pulpit\nWe got to change our ways in the hood\nUnderstand that it's AIDS in the hood...\n\nThe nigga trap...\n\n[Hook] - 2X\n\n(I got a Public Pretender.. tryin to make me a winner)\n(Nigga please don't surrender.. they'll have you for

looking at the Grand Wizard\nWar lord, vocal chord so vicious\nAnd I don't have to show riches\nTo pull up pull off with some bad bitches\nAnd it ain't about chivalry\nIt's about dope lyrics and delivery\nIt's about my persona\nAin't nothing like a man that can do what he wanna\nAin't nothing like man that you knew on the corner\nSeen 'em come up and fuck up the owner\nSeen 'em throw up Westside California\nNigga I'm hot as Phoenix Arizona\nI'm Utah, I got multiple bitches\nIt's a new law, keep a hold of your riches\nDumb nigga don't spend it as soon as you get it\nAnd recognize I'mma Captain, you're a Lieutenant\n\n[Hook: Ice Cube]\nI can say what I want to say, ain't nuttin to it\nGangsta rap made me do it\nIf I call you a nigga, ain't nuttin to it\nGangsta rap made me do it\nI can act like an animal, ain't nuttin to it\nGangsta rap made me do it\nIf I eat you like a cannibal, ain't nuttin to it\nGangsta rap made me do it\n\n[Scarface]\nNah nigga blame me, for severing cocaine to the geeks\nGangbanging the streets, shooting guns where you sleep\nPutting niggas in sheets, the noose hung from the tree\nThe corrupted police, I ain't denying it was me\nI'm the reason for the setback in blacks\nIt's a natural fact, that gangsta rap did that\nI hope that Barack could pull the troops for Iraq\nCause the truth is Iran, got them nuclear plants\nI can shoot me a cat in the head with a gat\nFor a man that considers me a nigga when I'm back in the slums\nWaiting for a check like a bum\nLook how I did them niggas off in 'Nam\nHard, I got the strolls full of hoes\nLiquor stores off the road\nBig church on the corner with a spot for my rose\nA Glock for my foes, wiping snot from my nose\nI'm guilty of it all, but I am not finna fold\n\n[Hook: Ice Cube]\n\n[Nas]\nUh, if they call you a nigga, ain't nuttin to it\nTell 'em Nas made you do it\nFelonious, Thelonious Monk melodic; Monster Cody OG\nHard as Rampart's police, warring like the ends was in Sunni\nI never pull my pants up, sagging my Gucci's, and what?\nI give a fuck who you bidded with, or where you cop coke\nThe bitch you with or the reason you're not broke\nI don't count your money, don't want none of your smoke\nI don't feel your pain, I ain't none of your folk\nIt's easy to put a gun in your throat\nBut I ain't on that, trying to sip Colada's where it's warm at\nCognac, crushed ice, y'all know how it is\nElijah said - A women half your age plus seven years\nIt's a plush way to live, this is for the blunted\nFor the niggas who keep it one hundred\nWho're hunted by DA's and Judges\n\n[Hook + Interlude: Ice Cube]\n\n[Outro: Ice Cube]\nOh yeah and another thing\nFor all ya niggas that don't do gangsta rap\nDon't get on TV talking about gangsta rap\nCause nine

to him cause you ain't a fan of me\nScary bitch with a gun that ain't a man to me\nThat's a animal, a fuckin' cannibal\nI'm Geronimo and Hannibal, with international\nGangster pull, I'm a bull in Barcelona\nWith a Corona, you's a fake-ass nigga\nWhere's your owner? I'm a real live man\nYou a persona, now I'm a goner\nCall my momma, and the coroner\nMr. Gun Man, your plan is workin'\nCause niggas is dyin', and mommas is hurtin'\n\n[Chorus: Musiq Soulchild]\nWhy you wanna murder me? You never ever heard of me\nYou don't know who I am, I could be part of your family tree\nNow, sent by G-O-D, to save the world, you and me\nYou never know who you facin', who you chasin', the life you wastin'\n\n[Ice Cube]\nI was made by the one and only G-O-D\nTo take my life, to the T-O-P\nNow here comes a motherfuckin' D-O-G\nWho ain't happy 'til a nigga is R.I.P\nTryin' to be somethin' he saw on BET\nEither T.I.P., or B.I.G\nI don't give a fuck what you saw on TV\nBut a one-eight-seven don't make an O.G\nI'm an O.G., never had to fake it\nGod gave me this, how you gon' take it?\nWhat'chu gon' tell 'em, when you get to heaven\nAnd he asks you why did you send back his present?\nWho the fuck are you? you motherfuckin peasant!\nEven got the nerve to ask the man for a blessing\nSend his ass to Hades with his big Mercedes\nNigga hell on earth is bein' stuck in the 80's\n\n[Chorus: Musiq Soulchild]\nWhy you wanna murder me? You never ever heard of me\nYou don't know who I am, I could be part of your family tree\nNow, sent by G-O-D, to save the world, you and me\nYou never know who you facin', who you chasin', the life you wastin'\n\n[Ice Cube]\nBefore you shoot me man think about it\nLet's go have a drink about it (Yeah)\nBefore you make a stink about it\nMan let's talk about it maybe we can walk up out it\nBut just don't be a coward\nAnd take my life, cause you got the power\nOf the white man's gunpowder\nCause you might face a gun tower\nAnd time never run out\nThey take the fun out, 'til your life run out\nSo don't pull the gun out\nIf you ever want a house just like Run's house\nIt's better than the big house\nLet's go find some women we can dig out\nFind a place we can pig out\nParty all night 'til the owner say get out\n\n[Chorus: Musiq Soulchild]\nWhy you wanna murder me? You never ever heard of me\nYou don't know who I am, I could be part of your family tree\nNow, sent by G-O-D, to save the world, you and me\nYou never know who you facin', who you chasin', the life

motherfuckers\nThought you knew the whole story\nUntil your mama\nTook a nigga on maury\nRead your test results\nAre you the father\nI looked at his bitch ass told him don't bother\nI'm the father of this gangsta shit\nNever thought that I have a bunch of bastard kids\nLil' bad-ass kids\nI whoop they ass every night\nSend the paramedics bitch\nAnd the black and white\nI brought you in this world\nI'll take you out\nDo you ugly\nSo mamma can't make you out\nYou know my style a colt\nFile a report\nI'm a dead-beat daddy\nNo child support\nYou get fooled like the last trick\nGet it out your ass bitch\nYou niggas know my pyroclastic flow\nC'mon!\n\n[Hook 1]\n\n[Hook 2] 4x\nYou want child support\nGet it out your ass bitch\n\n[Verse 2]\nYa'll niggas know\nYa'll bitches know\nWhere you get it from\nWho's the original\nYou got your daddy's mouth\nTalk like a criminal\nKeep it gangsta son\nNever get pigeon holed\nRap bastards tryin' to make a classic\nKeep your dumb-ass out of the casket\nCause intercope'll spend your money\nThey don't give a fuck\nAbout a dead rapper\nNigga they'll chop it up\nKeep it movin' y'all\nThey'll come mop it up\nCorrupt LAPD cover up\nEveryday nigga we know drama\nThey ain't lookin' for Osama\nAsk Biggie's mamma\nThank God that the gangsta's back\nWe ain't got to put up with this brainless rap\nMay your lungs collapse n' m.c's are funny\nAll you can rap about is pussy and money\nC'mon!\n\n[Hook 1]\n\n[Hook 2]\n\n[Verse 3]\nAll y'all rappers should kiss and make up\nTake your bullshit jewlry back to Jacob\nGet your mind right nigga\nAnd start to wake up\nCause the whole rap industry needs to shake up\nYou got million dollar niggas killin' million dollar niggas\nBustin' outta Bentleys\nWearin' chinchillasss\nThere you go again rollin' in your limo\nComin' from the Grammy's shootin' out the window\nI know the scripture\nBut there's something wrong with this picture\nWhat you mad about\nDiamonds all in your mouth\nNo car, no niggas house paid off\nI never heard of a rapper gettin' laid off\nBoy, you a fool\nOr you just act crazy\nOr you a grown crack baby born in the 80's\nTo all you motherfuckers say I went Hollywood\nI'm gangsta!\nI know when I got it good\n\n[Hook 1]\n\n[Hook 2]\n\n[Hook 3] 2x\nYoung rappers lookin' for pocket change\nWith boo-boo lyrics\nGo get your diaper changed\n\n[Outro]\nSmell like shit\nHeyy

Is it some brother in a big hat\nThinking he can get any bitch with a good rap?\nRolling in a fucked-up Lincoln\nLeaning to the side so it looks like he's sinking\nInto that leopard interior\nThis nigga think every girl's inferior\nTo his tongue, get a dumb bitch sprung\nAs she's selling more butt and don't even get a cut of the money\nHis name is Sonny and he know the play\nAnd hope to god that he don't find a runaway\nThat's looking to become a star\nHe'll have your ass in and out of every car\nWith every Ron and Rick, sucking every John's dick\nCome short of the money, get your ass kicked\nYou don't like it but you still call him hunk\nLast night the nigga put yo' ass in the trunk\nYou wanna leave, but Sonny started talking fast\nAnd it make you wanna go and sell more ass\nHe's getting rich, you his bitch and it's like that\nNow ask yourself, who's the mack?\n\n[Verse 2]\nWho's the mack? It is that fool that wanna pump the gas\nGive you a sad story and you give him cash?\nHe start macking and macking and you sucking\nQuick to say I'm down on my luck, and\nYou give a dollar or a quarter and he's on his way\nThen you see his sorry ass the next day\nAre you the one getting played like a sucka?\nOr do you say, \"Get a job, motherfucka?\"\nEvery day, the story gets better\nHe's wearing dirty pants and a funky-ass sweater\nHe claims he wants to get something to eat\nBut every day you find yourself getting beat\nHe get your money and he run across the street\nDon't look both ways 'cause he's in a daze\nAnd almost get his ass hit for the crack\nNow ask yourself, who's the mack?\n\n[Verse 3]\nWho's the Mack? Is it that nigga in the club\nAsking \"have you ever been in a hot tub?\"\nI know the game, so I watch it unfold\nWhen I see a boy pinned to your earlobe\nHe's talking shit and you crack a smile\nWhen he tell you that he can go buck wild\nFor a girl like you and make it feel good\nYou know it's drama, but it sound real good\nHe started dragging and hopefully he can start tagging\nThe pussy so he can keep bragging\nHe say, \"I'm 'a leave baby, can you go with me?\"\nYou wanna do it but you feeling like a H-O-E\nYou grab his hand, you leave and it's over\nCause the nigga ain't nothing but a rover\nYa knew the game and you still ended up on your back\nNow ask yourself, who's the mack?\n\n[Verse 4]\nMacking is the game and everybody's playing\nAnd as long as you believe what they saying\nConsider the a M-A-C-K and with no delay\nThey are gonna get all the play\nBut when it comes to me, save the drama for your mama\nIt's Ice Cube and you know that I'm a\nMack in my own right when it comes to rhyme and rap\nCause all I do is kick facts\nUnlike Iceberg Slim\nAnd all of them be claimin' be P-I-M-P\nNo, I'm not going out that way\nI'm just a straight up N-I-double-G-A\nNext time, you get over on a fool\nAnd you did the shit like real smooth\nThank Ice Cube for giving up the facts\nAnd ask yourself, \"Who's the Mack?\"\n\n[Outro]\nStraight gangsta Mack\nStraight gangsta Mack\nStraight gangsta Mack\nStraight gangsta Mack\nStraight gangsta Mack\nStraight gangsta Mack\nStraight gangsta Mack", "image":

gangsta mack\nStraight gangsta mack\nStraight gangsta mack\n\n[Verse 1]\nWho's the mack? Is it some brother in a big hat\nThinking he can get any bitch with a good rap?\nRolling in a fucked-up Lincoln\nLeaning to the side so it looks like he's sinking\nInto that leopard interior\nThis nigga think every girl's inferior\nTo his tongue, get a dumb bitch sprung\nAs she's selling more butt and don't even get a cut of the money\nHis name is Sonny and he know the play\nAnd hope to god that he don't find a runaway\nThat's looking to become a star\nHe'll have your ass in and out of every car\nWith every Ron and Rick, sucking every John's dick\nCome short of the money, get your ass kicked\nYou don't like it but you still call him hunk\nLast night the nigga put yo' ass in the trunk\nYou wanna leave, but Sonny started talking fast\nAnd it make you wanna go and sell more ass\nHe's getting rich, you his bitch and it's like that\nNow ask yourself, who's the mack?\n\n[Verse 2]\nWho's the mack? It is that fool that wanna pump the gas\nGive you a sad story and you give him cash?\nHe start macking and macking and you sucking\nQuick to say I'm down on my luck, and\nYou give a dollar or a quarter and he's on his way\nThen you see his sorry ass the next day\nAre you the one getting played like a sucka?\nOr do you say, \"Get a job, motherfucka?\"\nEvery day, the story gets better\nHe's wearing dirty pants and a funky-ass sweater\nHe claims he wants to get something to eat\nBut every day you find yourself getting beat\nHe get your money and he run across the street\nDon't look both ways 'cause he's in a daze\nAnd almost get his ass hit for the crack\nNow ask yourself, who's the mack?\n\n[Verse 3]\nWho's the Mack? Is it that nigga in the club\nAsking \"have you ever been in a hot tub?\"\nI know the game, so I watch it unfold\nWhen I see a boy pinned to your earlobe\nHe's talking shit and you crack a smile\nWhen he tell you that he can go buck wild\nFor a girl like you and make it feel good\nYou know it's drama, but it sound real good\nHe started dragging and hopefully he can start tagging\nThe pussy so he can keep bragging\nHe say, \"I'm 'a leave baby, can you go with me?\"\nYou wanna do it but you feeling like a H-O-E\nYou grab his hand, you leave and it's over\nCause the nigga ain't nothing but a rover\nYa knew the game and you still ended up on your back\nNow ask yourself, who's the mack?\n\n[Verse 4]\nMacking is the game and everybody's playing\nAnd as long as you believe what they saying\nConsider the a M-A-C-K and with no delay\nThey are gonna get all the play\nBut when it comes to me, save the drama for your mama\nIt's Ice Cube and you know that I'm a\nMack in my own right when it comes to rhyme and rap\nCause all I do is kick facts\nUnlike Iceberg Slim\nAnd all of them be claimin' be P-I-M-P\nNo, I'm not going out that way\nI'm just a straight up N-I-double-G-A\nNext time, you get over on a fool\nAnd you did the shit like real smooth\nThank Ice Cube for giving up the facts\nAnd ask yourself, \"Who's the Mack?\"\n\n[Outro]\nStraight gangsta Mack\nStraight gangsta Mack\nStraight gangsta Mack\nStraight gangsta Mack\nStraight gangsta Mack\nStraight gangsta Mack\nStraight gangsta Mack"}}, {"title": "Alive On Arrival", "album": "Death Certificate", "year": "1991-10-29", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nDown at the best spot\nIts me and J-Dee and they sellin' more birds than a pet shop\nThe spot's hot, and everybody nervous\nThat's when the blue car surfaced\nOh why did fools have to let loose?\nHeard six pops from a deuce-deuce\nBig Tom had to push us\nThirteen niggas runnin' straight to the bushes\nFor they gats so they can draw down\nBut why a motherfucker like me have to fall down?\nNot knowin' why I dropped out\nFuck it, still can't afford to get popped out\nSo now I gotta jet\nOnly ran one block, but my shirt is soakin' wet\nTryna see if we got 'em\nLooked down and my sweatshirt's red at the bottom\nDidn't panic but I still looked cracked out\nYelled to the homies then I blacked out\n\n[Interlude 1: Homies]\nGet up, man!

fools have to let loose?\nHeard six pops from a deuce-deuce\nBig Tom had to push us\nThirteen niggas runnin' straight to the bushes\nFor they gats so they can draw down\nBut why a motherfucker like me have to fall down?\nNot knowin' why I dropped out\nFuck it, still can't afford to get popped out\nSo now I gotta jet\nOnly ran one block, but my shirt is soakin' wet\nTryna see if we got 'em\nLooked down and my sweatshirt's red at the bottom\nDidn't panic but I still looked cracked out\nYelled to the homies then I blacked out\n\n[Interlude 1: Homies]\nGet up, man! Get up, man! (C'mon keep that nigga awake, man!)\nC'mon, man! Get up man, c'mon man!\n\n[Verse 2]\nWoke up in the back of a trey\nOn my way to MLK\nThat's the county hospital, jack, ha\nWhere niggas die over a little scratch\nSittin' in the trauma center\nIn my back is where the bullet entered\n\"Yo, nurse, I'm gettin' kinda warm!\"\nBitch still made me fill out the fuckin' form\nCoughin' up blood on my hands and knees\nThen I heard, \"Freeze, nigga! Don't move!\"\nYo, I didn't do a thing\nDon't wanna go out like my man Rodney King\nStill got gaffled\nInternal bleeding as the bullet starts to travel\nNow I'm handcuffed\nBeing asked information on my gang affiliation\n\"I don't bang, I rock the good rhymes\nAnd I'm a victim of neighborhood crime.\"\n\n[Interlude 2: Police Officers]\nAre you the only one who got shot? What kinda gun was he carrying? Do you know who it was? (No, man, don't know who it was, man) Are you in a gang? (Man, what does it matter, man? I'm shot)\n\n[Verse 3]\nI need to see a MD\nAnd y'all motherfuckers giving me the third degree?\nLook at the waiting room\nIt's filled to the rim like the county jail day room\nNobody gettin' help\nSince we poor, the hospital it moves slow\nNow I'm laid out\nPeople steppin' over me to get closer to the TV\nJust like a piece of dog shit\nNow will I die on this nappy ass carpet?\nOne hour done passed\nDone watched two episodes of M*A*S*H\nAnd when I'm almost through\nThey call my name and put me in ICU\nHalfway dead\nNo respect, and handcuffed to the bed\nNow the drama starts\nCause the bullet must be just a hair from my heart\nThen I begin the ass kissin'\nJust to get looked at, by a overworked physician\nHad the chills, but my temperature's a hundred and three\nOnly got a band-aid and a IV\nThat's when I start cussin'\nPolice steady askin' me who did the bustin'\n\n[Interlude 3: Police Officers]\nWhat did you get shot with? (Twenty-two!)\nWho shot you? (I dunno who shot me)\nWas it gang-bangers? (Had to be)\n\n[Verse 4]\nWhy, oh why, can't I get help?\nCause I'm black, I gots to go for self\nToo many black bodies the hospital housin'\nSo at 10 p.m, I was Audi 5000"}}, {"title": "Better Off Dead", "album": "AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted", "year": "1990-05-16", "lyrics": "[Intro]\n\n[Footsteps]\n\n[Prison Guard:]\nHeheh..

to cock and bust now look at us\nWe done turned to ashes and dust to dust\nI shoulda turned the cuz and returned the love\nI shoulda passed the bud to all the bloods\nAnd leave them slugs with them pigs in the mud\nWho the fuck turned 2Pac into a thug?\nAll I used to get was a pound and a hug\nI remember when we used to hate them drugs\nNow we can't rap without being fucked up\nHigh in the club but you sound like a drunk\nHard in the street but a jailhouse punk\nMe and that nigga, yeah we used to bring the funk\nNow we got love and respect like a monk\nUnderstand that we got a lot in common\nHomie you in the same boat that I'm in\n\n[Hook]\nI'm callin' all the real people (real people)\nLet 'em know that the change gon' come\nTell me where the real people? (Real people)\nIt's time to wake up and stand as one\nCallin' all the real people (real people)\nYou still got our faith nah we ain't none\nTell me where the real people out there\nThe real people out there\n\n[Verse 2: Common]\nIt's a good day when it's me and O'Shea\nIt's like the times we cheered for O.J\nI say \"Mike\", Cube say \"Kobe\"\nBut ain't no more beef, I put that on chief\nBlaow, a little homie dead in the streets\nIt's like the day they compared us to meat\nGlad Farrakan prepared us to meet\nNow me and bro bringing meals to the meek\nThink about my homie locked up like a Rasta\nDude in my ear askin' me about the Oscars\nI build with the gods to show improvement\nHard to complain, real people goin' through it\nI know the movement like I was Huey Newton\nCan't explain why youngin's are shootin'\nThe revolution will not be on the 'Gram\nThe revolution is who I am, God damn\n\n[Hook]\nI'm callin' all the real people (real people)\nLet 'em know that the change gon' come\nTell me where the real people? (Real people)\nIt's time to wake up and stand as one\nCallin' all the real people (real people)\nYou still got our faith nah we ain't none\nTell me where the real people out there\nThe real people out there\n\n[Outro]\nI don't care what your color is\nAll my real people, real people love this, love this\nI don't care what your color is\nAll my real people, real people love this, love this\nI don't care what your color is\nAll my real people, real people love this, love this\nI don't care what your color is\nAll my real people, real people love this, love this\nBe the change"}}, {"title": "$100 Dollar Bill Y'all", "album": "Greatest Hits", "year": "2001-12-04", "lyrics": "[Bridge]\nGet numbers, get names\nThick dames\nHeadhunters get brains\nBig thangs\nGive niggas shit-stains\nThe shit, man\nAnd don't you forget, man\n\n[Verse 1]\nWe be\nThe best of CG\nGreedy\nAbduct the PD\nSee me?\nNigga, not in 3D\nBe me?\nHah, it's not that easy\nI'm breezy\nAnd off the heezy\nMe and my woman's like George & Wheezy\nMovin' on up, niggas use to tease me\nSee me on top\nIt makes you queasy\nSick with it\nBitch, I'm Bruce Lee\nSeduce me\nYou're nice and juicy\nIn the parking lot, I gots to get mine\nWhy the fuck we goin' in when there's bitches in line?\nI spend my time watchin' bitches' behinds\nThinkin' bad shit in the back of my mind\nI bump and grind with nothing less than a dime\nMaking movie money, you still investin' in rhymes\n\n[Hook]\nAnd I'm in this bitch\nWith a hundred dollar bill, y'all\nAbout to spend this bitch\nI'm in this bitch\nI got a hundred dollar bill, y'all\nAbout to spend this bitch\nI'm in this bitch\nWho got a hundred dollar bill, y'all?\nAbout to spend this bitch\nI'm in this bitch\nI got a hundred dollar bill, y'all\nAbout to spend this bitch\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm in here\nGot all you freaks lookin'\nWhen we walk by, pussy start cookin'\nRookies start tookin'\nGet your ass up, V.I.P. section's gettin' tooken\nMight dance, might not\nMight spend enough\nCool as hell, but still pipin' hot\nSoon as I find a spot\nAll my people gather 'round\nThe nigga with the shiny watch--me\nIce Cube, motherfucker\nNext to me, you a test tube motherfucker\nWe kinda rude, motherfucker\nGet too close and bucka!

Blackbeard\nI sail the seven seas, ho, I'm off the grid\nIt's the ultimate, baby I'm the bulk of it\nThe whole package, a nigga with no baggage\nIt's kinda tragic when you driving through Irvine\nIs this Germany 1939?\nI'm a gangsta boy, not the nerdy kind\nThey gotta dirty mind, all about the dolla sign\n\n[Chorus]\nThey put the sheep to sleep\nAnd dominate the weak\nThey put the sheep to

O'Shea! Get your ass in here, boy You hear me calling you? O'Shea!]\n\nWhen I was young I used to hang with the seventh graders\nLittle bad motherfucker playing Space Invaders\nFucking with the girls in the fourth grade\nEither feeling on they butts or pulling on they braids\nWalking with the schoolhouse bully\nBy doing that, I had a lot of pull, G\nCheating on tests, making a mess\nCussing like a sailor at recess\nIt must a been a half moon\nCause you'll catch me running out the little girls' bathroom\nChewing on Good and Plenties\nGot my gamble on at lunch pitching pennies\nYo I was living like the class clown\nPulling all the hokes, making all the jokes man\nWhen you young it's hard to see\nThat it's wrong throwing rocks at the RTD\nPopping out your window with a BB gun\nBetter yet knocking on your door and run\nPlaying hide-and-go-get-it for a little stank\nEven though I was still shooting blanks\nAs soon as the dark hit\nI was stealing candy out the corner market\nUntil I got my ass whipped\nCause I was ten years old, doing dumb shit\n\nThirteen, that's how old I was\nWhen my jimmy started getting a little peach fuzz\nAnd I was looking at any butt and ass\nMe and my homies started cutting class\nGoing up to the high school\nLooking for any bitch I could lie to\nTell em I was older than I really was\nSmoked my first joint and got really buzzed\nThat's what a mack's made of\nBut when I got my first piece of pussy I fell in love\nHard as a rock the long way\nAnd then I put the rubber on the wrong way\nBut I still gotta have it\nOverexcited and fucking like a jackrabbit\nGoddamn I was hype\nA virgin but I still knew how to lay the pipe\nEven though the ho worked me\nI still knocked the boots from here to Albuquerque\nThen the shit got strange, money\nI started shaking and jimmy felt funny\nThen the nut came gushing\nI jumped up got dressed and start pushing\nCause I thought the bitch broke my dick\nCause I was still young doing dumb shit\n\nAt 17 got my first Volkswagen\nAnd mastered the life-long art of dragging\nTo the women in college\nHung out with the OG's and got some street knowledge\nBreaking in cars and all that\nHitting punk fools with a baseball bat\nFucking at a real fast rate\nTil they said that I might not graduate\nThen I said, \"Fuck the dumb shit\nCause Pops'll fuck me up quick\nIf things continue.\"\nSo I start rapping about shit I been through\nAnd I got real good\nNow I look at all the kids in the neighborhood\nTrying to be baby macks\nDoing shit that I did seven years back\nGoing through a stage\nBut before they can grow up they on the front page\nAnd they moms is having a fit\nCause they died young, doing dumb shit"}}, {"title": "Man's Best Friend", "album": "Death Certificate", "year": "1991-10-29", "lyrics": "\"I can dig it!\"\n\nChorus: samples

One]\nHere's another topic I'm addressin'\nSo learn a quick lesson, about your Smith and Wesson\nSit your ass back and comprehend\nAs I let you know about man's best friend\nNow remember: it used to be a dog like Lassie\nBut now in ninety-one it's a gun if you asked me\nJust like a jimmy hat's used for protection\nI use my nine when suckers start to flexin'\nCause if you run up and try to play mine\nI'd rather have a AK than a fuckin' canine\nCause if you shot your gun, and my dog tried to fetch ya'\nMe and the dog's goin out on a stretcher\nAnd I ain't with that, so I gotta get that\nBig black gat, aim and I hit that\nForget about a dog fool, he'll shit in the den\nNowadays.. a gat is man's best friend\n\nChorus + Cube saying \"Man's best friend\" after *3 first time\n\n[Verse Two]\nHere is the reason why Ice Cube pack\nJust in case the little punks try to jack\nI can't put a motherfuckin pitbull\nUnder a coat, in the small of my back\nSo I gotta take my Beretta, and I betcha\nIt'll probably work, a 100 percent better\nCause it'll keep me out of danger\nWith sixteen in the clip and one in the chamber\nSo this goes to all y'all intruders\nBeware of the owner, cause the owner is a shooter\nI don't just wanna give your ass rabies\nI'd rather have your ass pushing up daisies\nAnd I can't do that with Benji\nRin Tin Tin, or Spuds McKenzie\nForget about a dog fool, he'll shit in the den\nNowadays, a gat is man's best friend\n\n\"Just don't let me see you shoot no dog!\"\n\"Hey, I got shots fired here, send me another unit\"\n\"The profile of a typical American gun owner is this:\nOver thirty, white, male, middle class\" --] Peter Jennings\n\n\"Take that motherfuckers!\"", "image":

addressin'\nSo learn a quick lesson, about your Smith and Wesson\nSit your ass back and comprehend\nAs I let you know about man's best friend\nNow remember: it used to be a dog like Lassie\nBut now in ninety-one it's a gun if you asked me\nJust like a jimmy hat's used for protection\nI use my nine when suckers start to flexin'\nCause if you run up and try to play mine\nI'd rather have a AK than a fuckin' canine\nCause if you shot your gun, and my dog tried to fetch ya'\nMe and the dog's goin out on a stretcher\nAnd I ain't with that, so I gotta get that\nBig black gat, aim and I hit that\nForget about a dog fool, he'll shit in the den\nNowadays.. a gat is man's best friend\n\nChorus + Cube saying \"Man's best friend\" after *3 first time\n\n[Verse Two]\nHere is the reason why Ice Cube pack\nJust in case the little punks try to jack\nI can't put a motherfuckin pitbull\nUnder a coat, in the small of my back\nSo I gotta take my Beretta, and I betcha\nIt'll probably work, a 100 percent better\nCause it'll keep me out of danger\nWith sixteen in the clip and one in the chamber\nSo this goes to all y'all intruders\nBeware of the owner, cause the owner is a shooter\nI don't just wanna give your ass rabies\nI'd rather have your ass pushing up daisies\nAnd I can't do that with Benji\nRin Tin Tin, or Spuds McKenzie\nForget about a dog fool, he'll shit in the den\nNowadays, a gat is man's best friend\n\n\"Just don't let me see you shoot no dog!\"\n\"Hey, I got shots fired here, send me another unit\"\n\"The profile of a typical American gun owner is this:\nOver thirty, white, male, middle class\" --] Peter Jennings\n\n\"Take that motherfuckers!\""}}, {"title": "Thank God", "album": "Raw Footage", "year": "2008-08-19", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nI do gangsta rap\nThey wanna blame the world problems on gangsta rap\nIt's our fault 'cause motherfuckers is dying in Iraq\nIt's our fault 'cause motherfuckers is starving in Africa\nIt's gangsta rap fault that people are poor, can't get enough to fucking eat or live their life\nThat's rap music fault\nIt's rap music fault that we got all these goddamn laws and restrictions and shit we can't do\nThey blame it all on us\nI'm blamin' them motherfuckers for gangsta rap\nBecause if they didn't create these kind of conditions, I wouldn't have shit to rap about. You know what I mean?\n\nA'right, a'right, everybody back up, star status comin' through\nThe man is in the building\nDon't touch him, don't look at him, and don't ask to take a picture\n\n{Verse 1}\nI walks in, with that California swagger\nWith the attitude that it ain't nothin' badder\nNow, you can call me rapper, or you can call me mister\nBig money trapper, fuckin' with your sister\nI'mma do it my way, from here to Zimbabwe\nIt's too hot today\nFuck what you got to say\nFuck if you mad at me, better go change your battery\nAin't gon' take my sunshine, like I hit the lottery\nAh, he's a show off, a hot head go off (Yeah)\nDon't make him mad, he might tear the fucking door off\nTake all his calls, and don't try to blow off\n'Cause one of his people, might cut your fucking toe off\nIce

from the noise\nYou can hear me from a block away\nI'm sittin next to yo' ass and can't hear, what you got to say\nMy shit is loud, my ears is ringin\nMy paint job is wet, my chrome is gleamin\nI feel like a vet ballin on these rookies\nAn old school bully, you must have played hooky\nI bring it like a bookie my aggression is depressin\nDon't give a motherfucker time to learn his lesson!\nA LUNATIC~! Y'all know what I represent\nThe only rapper who wanna fistfight the President!\n\n[Hook: repeat 4X]\nIt take a nation of niggas to hold us back\n\n[Ice Cube]\nWhen I bang this is dangerous, niggas go brainless\nSo bang this with the fo'-five stainless\nAnd understand that you lookin at the famous\nWest coast rapper, who act like a anus\nHollywood! They thought they could tame this\nPitbull, but I know what the game is\nThem fuckers cheat like a NBA ref\nIf you smoke one they'll electrocute you to death\nI got God on my intellect, Godzilla by the neck\nWhen a nigga come through, who you wanna holla at\nGhost writers hit the deck, when your boy got a tec\nWhere the fuck is, Afrika, Bambaataa at?\nWe need to take it back, fuck Viacom\nClear Clear Channel, and Radio One\nYou motherfuckers programmed by the programmers\nThat's why you gettin locked up by the do' slammers\nNot me!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Ice Cube]\nThey music so fluffy, I'mma stay gutter\nThat shit is kind of popcorn, my shit is so butter\nMy style never change, in 22 summers\nStraight independent, and doin my numbers\nThis shit don't sell, you know I'm still paid\nSo sourpuss niggas, can drink lemonade\nI'm doin it for the love, you doin it because\nYou need that advancement to spend on them dubs\nI don't need a penny, but I need many\nDon't worry about my money boy cause I got plenty\nYou muh'fuckers worry about flossin so much\nYou don't know the fundamentals you forgot how to brush!\nThese 32 teeth, will give yo' ass grief\nBite you like a Fatburger if you got beef\nSo who's it gon' be?

the day, if a ho wanted ya dough\nShe give you a piece of ass and there we go\nGo and get knocked up and then get socked up\nYou be broke and locked up\nBut the new's done hit\nBitches all over on some new improved shit\nTo all y'all macks\nCome to find out that bitches are pullin jacks\nI remember every night all you had to worry about\nWas gettin caught at a red light\nAnd a nigga jack you for your Daytons and chains;\nNow shit done changed\nCos you gots to watch the ones in the skirt\nAnd it ain't about gettin burnt\nI know it sounds strange, but could you\nStop thinkin with ya dick for a change\nCos you'll get a bullet in your brain, Mr Rich\nAnd about that bitch, don't trust em\n\n[Chorus 2x]\n(Ice Cube comin at'cha with a crazy pitch)\nDon't trust no (Bitch! Bitch! Bitch!)\n(Ice Cube comin at'cha with a crazy pitch)\nYou can't trust no (Bitch! Bitch! Bitch!)\n\n[Verse 2]\nHere's how the bitches jack:\nThey try to catch a dumb nigga in the act\nYou came to the club, stepped to the bar\nAnd pulled out a wad of Dubs\nAfter you got buzzed, she walk by\nYou saw how big her ass was\nGot her on the dancefloor\nAnd she started dancin like a ho\nJimmy got stiff, she ain't have a ride home\nSo you gave the bitch a lift\nShe didn't wanna trouble you\nBut hopped her big ass in your BMW\nHopped to her house and started kissin\nAnd Jimmy just wouldn't listen\nCos you got real horny\nAnd that ain't cool at four in the morning\nStarted undressing the ho\nGot to the drawers and the ho said \"No!\n\"Not on the first date\n\"It's gettin kinda late, could you come back at eight?\"\nYou said \"Yeah!\" cos you thought you met a wholesome ho\nBut nigga, she know you rollin in some dough\nAnd you'll regret and somethin 'bout a bitch you just met\nDon't trust em!\n\n[Bridge]\n(scratching of BBD's 'Poison' and PE's 'Don't Believe The Hype')\n\n[Verse 3]\nEight o'clock on the dot, nigga's hot\nDick hard as a rock\nStraight on a solo creep\nCan't wait till her little boy go to sleep\nSo you can seduce the G\nBust a nut and make an excuse to leave\nYou got her worked out cos you the man\nBut the bitch got diff'rent plans\nShe said \"Take off your clothes, jump in the bed\"\nWhile she powder her nose\nYou get butt naked, cos you ready to wreck it!\nCos you's a motherfuckin pro, next thing you know\nThe door flies open with a blast\nWith four niggas in ski masks\nPointin a gun at the pimp\nYou're scared as a motherfucker and Jimmy done went limp\nThey beat you down just a taste\nTake ya to your house and make ya open up the safe\nDrove you far, tied up in the trunk of your own fuckin car\nTake you out and pop the cap\nI told you the bitch was a trap\nDon't trust em!\n\n[Chorus 2x]\n(Ice Cube comin at'cha with a crazy pitch)\nDon't trust no (Bitch!

They\u2019re a football team known for wearing silver and black and as one of the teams with the worst attitude. According to an ESPN documentary he made, he was a fan before the Oakland Raiders moved to Los Angeles. When they moved to Los Angeles, they became a gang symbol.

blessed\nWith the Father, Son, Spirit, and the Holy Ghost\nBut my whole neighborhood is comatose\nLookin' for survival\nThe devil made you a slave\nAnd he gave you a bible\nFour hundered years of gettin' our ass kicked\nBy so-called Christians and Catholics\nBut I'mma watch 'em burn in the fire\nSee I'mma G that's why I ain't in ya choir\nCause I see, cause I know\nThe church ain't nothin' but a fashion show\nGet the devil do a one-eighty-seven\n\n[Hook]\nAnd they won't call me a nigga\nWhen I Get To Heaven\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nYour waitin' for the devil to come from the ground\nClown, take a look around\nJust look at the cross that the priest is holdin'\nA beast, in sheeps clothin'\nBut I'm rollin'\nWith that knowledge of self\nCause Heaven ain't just wealth\nSo mister preacher\nIf I couldn't pay my tithe\nDo I hafta wait outside?\nWhite man, please take another look\nCause we couldn't be readin' out the same book\nCause you's a crook, and I'm a brotha\nKing James had sex with his motha\nIs that your edition? Is that your religion?\nBlack men you gotta make a decision\nCause God is comin' on day number seven\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\n\nThe same white man that threw me in the slamma\nHe bombed a church in Alabama\nSo if I cocked the hammer God won't mind\nIf I have to kill the human swine\nCause God is a killa from the start\nWhy you think, Noah had to build his arc\nAnd God is a man from his feet to his hair\nThat's why you say \"amen\" after each and every prayer\nI just stare at the church man\nSpendin' more money on the church-van\nBut Elijah's got a plan\nGot the white man screamin', \"Damn, that Farrakhan\"\nCause one day these babies'll up rise\nMuch more than bow ties and bean pies\nKickin' knowledge at the Seven-Eleven\n\n[Hook]\n\n...But when it come to standin' up\nWe find a convenient excuse, to lay down\nBack away from struggle"}}, {"title": "Growin Up", "album": "Laugh Now, Cry Later", "year": "2006-06-06", "lyrics": "[Ice Cube]\nHa ha, that's my shit\nTurn it up {*echoes*}\nUhh, yeah\n\nI hear a beat like this, and think about growin up\nHouse parties, with gangbangers showin up\nRepresent your hood, everybody throw it up\nThey say Cube get on the mic, nigga blow it up\nI used to be lyrical, political\nBut now you want it sugarcoated like cereal\nFirst I met Dre, then I met Yella (yessir)\nDr. Dre made me rap acapella\nMe and Jinx did a show at Dooto's\nWith K-Dee, I think it was two shows\nThen Dre introduced me to E\nCruisin down the street in his red Jeep\nHe said, yo niggas we should flip it like this\nCause them Boyz N the Hood like the gangsta shit\nI put the pen to the pad, young nigga was raw\nAnd told the world how we felt about the law\nIt was real\n\n[Hook 2X: samples] + (Cube)\nI see the happiness (all day every day)\nI see the pain\nWhere am I (growin up in the hood)\nBack down memory lane\n\n[Ice Cube]\nOh shit, it's N.W.A.!\nThem niggas on tour and they comin our way\nLil' Eminem is still tucked away\nIn that trailer park, just bumpin our tape\nJerry Heller tried to make his escape\nI had to bounce, while other niggas got raped\nSame niggas turned around and said fuck me\nNo FUCK YOU cause I'm down with Chuck D\nAnd I'm 'bout to do a movie up, a classic\nWhen I hit the screen, nigga it was magic\nNever thought I'd see Eazy in a casket\nThanks for everythang, that's on everythang\nI learned a lot of game from you\nI like your son, he got his name from you\nI tell him everythang that he need to know\nIf he ask my advice, I won't think twice homey\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Ice Cube]\nFrom _Boyz N the Hood_, to _XXX 2_\nEverybody wanna know my next move\nFans all around say \"We love you Cube!\"\nI wanna take time to say I love you too\nI love all my fans cause they know I'm a man\nAnd not a little boy or some fuckin play toy\nA lot of niggas say I grew up on you\nAnd let me know if anybody fuck wit'chu\nCause you talk a lot of shit about the red, black & blue\nAnd how they treat a nigga called Katrina, did you see her\nWhite folks worry 'bout them fuckin misdemeanor\nWhile black people dyin in that God damn arena\nJust because I'm actin nigga never stop rappin\nIt's in my blood homey, I'mma keep the party crackin\nMoney keep stackin 'til they put me in a casket\nWho you think you fuckin wit?

down like the ice cream truck\nThese police, they never light me up\nI'm that nigga, baby, hype me up\nFuckin' up at work, they never write me up\nThey always hold me down and raise me up\nAnd all these women wanna glaze me up\nNever turnt down, I'm turnt up\nYou heard me, bitch, I said, \"I'm turnt up\"\nAlways on ten, always too loud\nAlways too hard for this boujee ass crowd\nEven these haters, they love my style\nSo, I don't know what you talkin' about\n\n[Chorus: Ice Cube]\nSorry, y'all, I ain't got no haters\nAll I got is motherfuckin' players\nWe get money in motherfuckin'

don't shop for bargains, fuck a pre-sale\nToo much game tryna sell some\nYou know you can't hate on a real one\nToo $hort, I ain't no nice dude\nI'm like Ice Cube, run up in your wife fool\nO.G., enjoyin' my life\nStill gettin' money when I'm on the mic\nThirty years later still spittin' flows\nGettin' paid to call these bitches hoes\nI get love wherever I go\nAnd I'm always tryna get some more\nBeeeotch\n\n[Chorus: Ice Cube]\nSorry, y'all, I ain't got no haters\nAll I got is motherfuckin' players\nWe get money in motherfuckin' layers\nSorry, y'all, I ain't got no haters\nSorry, y'all, I ain't got no haters\nAll I got is maids and waiters\nAll I got is suits and gators\nY'all niggas lost and I'm Las Vegas\n\n[Verse 3: Ice Cube]\nJackpot, think I'm in the crack spot? You a crackpot\nI'm a slip knot and I'ma get hot\nAnd I'ma stay hot so take a backseat, nigga, Maybach\nBoy, do what I say, nigga, robot\nYou kinda hit and miss, I'm the sure shot\nNever sold out, niggas bought out\nYou won't survive the fallout when I go all out\nMichael ball out but never touch no balls\nI ain't a athlete, I can't take no loss\nAll I know is champagne in my eyes\nAll this

breaking laws, swimming through the water like Jaws\nGumby's pause, and take they drawers, no balls\nGod damn it, niggers' take my planet for granted, I can't stand it\nCatch a flight across the Atlantic\nStep off the plane, nothing but expense of the game\nBitch, I'm rich, you know my name, show me the cane\nNow are you sure, one hundred percent pure\nCause if it's not, believe me the shit's getting hot\nI've got a plot to make your whole family deaf dumb and blind\n(Tell em one more time), the world is mine\n\n[Hook] [x4]\n\n[Bridge] [x2]\nThe world is mine, nigga, back up\nI've got to get mine before I act up\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt's a quarter to eight, I'm not finished my plate\nI've got a phone call to make, my niggers' tell me it's fake\nOh, what a mistake, here's what I want you to break\nTie his feet with some weight, throw his ass in a lake\nAnd then set up a date between me and his mate\nTell her lobster and steak, and, bitch, don't be late\nOh, the pussy was great, I'm still sealing your fate\nCause you can't imitate, the nigga you love to hate\n\n[Hook] [x4]\n\n[Verse 3: Cube](Mack-10)\nCan I grin, show my fin, I'm down with Mack 10\nDub C, K Dee, and Kausion\nIt don't

lick, west side is the clique\n(Can't get enough of this gangster shit)\nYou want to check our caj\u00f3ns, we've got the Fed's up on us\nWe've got to roll on Daytona's because we know that they want us\nAnd if they catch us in rap, it's a reasonable doubt\nMy niggers' pointing me out, my momma screams and she shouts\nBut we've got enough green from our triple beam\nTo hire the prosecution and the dream team\nThis world ain't nothing but a dollar sign\nI'm a partner in crime, the world is mine\n\n[Hook] [x4]\n\n[Bridge: Mack 10]\nYeah, you punk ass niggas know the side, so check it\nWhen you

now I'm in the rap game\nAnd I don't hang out as much, bang out dope cuts\nStanding on stage and I'm grabbing my nuts\nBut when it comes to getting in a circle\nI'm hitting sevens turning broke niggas purple\nLooking for Little Joe and the dumb nigga scream and choke\nWhen deuce-deuce hit the floor yo\nNow which of ya wanna fade the twenty?\nI'm turnin your fat pockets skinny\nAh yeah I'm shaking the ivory\nAnd boom it's like they die for me\nFool you can get loud, get mad, hit the joint\nBut don't forget my point\nThere it is yo\nI put my Nike on the bet so it won't slide\nMoney gone cause I'm never hitting deuce-five\nI'm never hitting four-trey no way\nYou wanna leave but come on ho stay\nNigga fever that\u2019ll work\nPoppa needs brand-new shoes and a sweatshirt\nFool you can't even fuck with that\nAnd now that I'm winning I gots to get my gat\nCause I see your homies starting to look\nAnd broke motherfuckers they make the best crooks\nAnd I'm feeling like a baller\nBucking fools now the circles getting smaller\nNow you wanna go and scheme\nPunk niggas like you just love to triple-team\nSo I pick up my money and start walking\nCause now I let the gat start talking\nNow since

ain't nothing but a menace\nWhen we get the motherfucking dog in us\nPlaying them old beats\nI'm pouring out some of my beer for my homies\nReady to peel your cap\nYou can't believe \"Faces of Death\" on wax\nSome say the Mob ain't positive\nMan fuck that shit cause I gots to live\nHow I live and you could either give a fuck punk\nYo or get your ass bucked\nSome rappers are heaven-sent\nBut Self-Destruction don't pay the fucking rent\nSo you can either sell dope or get your ass a job\nI'd rather roll it wit the Lench Mob\n\n[Hook]\nLench Mob! Lench Mob! Lench Mob!\nFor lynching any sucker (x4)\n(The Lench Mob is taking the 9 to ya mind all the motherfucking time!)\n(Yeah, motherfucker!)\n(Do it!)\n\n[Verse 2]\nTo be down with the Mob is simple\nMind your own you want a spot find your own\nAnd take mine if you're badder than the strong man\nI do the right thing I do the wrong thing\nDo anything cause I ain't faking the scene\nIt's all about how much bacon you bring\nAnd if you see something from the gat I will stuff it\nYo you ain't seen nothing\nCause if you testify you're living blind\nCause in the city you live and let die\nRolling with the fools One Time can't beat\nOn my knees in the street interlock my hands and feet\nHe said \"I know you\" I said \"you might\nMy name is Ice Cube I did a song you didn't like\"\nSo he soaked me up like Bounty\nHad to do a week in the county\nA piece of cake it was just like a party\nCause in the county you know everybody\nNo I didn't kill or steal or rob\nLocked up for what cause I'm rollin' wit the Lench Mob\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nIf you know a female that's rollin' with the Lench Mob\nWatch your step cause the gat is kept\nIn the purse like my homegirl Yo-Yo\nYou gotta be down and you can't be a ho no\nCause if you are I'll be the first one to bust you out\nAfter my crew I'll be the first one to rush you out\nGet the picture or bitch\nYou'll get the eighty-six\nIf she wanna try and mix\nBusiness and pleasure make up your own mind\nYou gotta be a ho on your own time\nDon't sleep cause even on a solo creep\nYo the Mob is still deep\nAnd we'll play ya just like a nit-wit\nYou thought you got with the crew you can't get with\nSo get the noose ready for the lynching\nNow 235 is what I'm benching\nBut nowadays it's still not enough\nI got something guaranteed to stop the bum rush\nGive me the gat, step back, and watch me do the job\nRolling with the motherfucking Lench Mob\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro]\nAyo, fuck that man\nI'm not going back to jail\nFuck that, Ice Cube\nMan, I'm rollin' wit the Lench Mob", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1cb382d2d9fb4a9bfa94e3074c1aa220.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Ice Cube", "raw": {"annotation_count": 9, "api_path": "/songs/22942",

motherfucking dog in us\nPlaying them old beats\nI'm pouring out some of my beer for my homies\nReady to peel your cap\nYou can't believe \"Faces of Death\" on wax\nSome say the Mob ain't positive\nMan fuck that shit cause I gots to live\nHow I live and you could either give a fuck punk\nYo or get your ass bucked\nSome rappers are heaven-sent\nBut Self-Destruction don't pay the fucking

superstar?\nDon't they know who we are\nWe going all the way baby\nWe going win this war\n\n[Hook : Michael Jackson]\n\nNothing you can say, nothing you can do\nWe be balling you, we be balling you\nNo one to defeat, you'll see what we can do\nWe be balling you, we be balling you\n\nSo hard to defeat, we love just to compete\nWe be balling you, we be balling you\nHate to make you plead, we'll bring you to your knees\nWe be balling you, we be balling you\n\n[Ice Cube - Talking]\n\nShake them off, shake them off, take them off\nFor the real, for the real, we rock them in\nShake them off, shake them off, take them off\nFor the real, for the real, we rock them in\n\n[Outro]\n\nWe be balling, we be balling\nWe be balling, we be balling\nWe be balling, we be Balling\nWe be balling",
