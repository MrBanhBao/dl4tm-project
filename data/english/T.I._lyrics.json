long time ago\nI knew a bad bitch, but she was kind of slow\nStill gave it up when it's a few of us\nShe let me finger-fuck her on the school bus\nWe used to cut school with her and run train\nShe wanted to hang with us, we wanted one thang\nJust penetratin' that throat, dawg\nShe choked on it like smoke, dawg\nBut whenever I fucked up my re-up\nIn a dice game I go see her\nShe'll give me enough to buy a quarter ounce\nAnd then blow a blunt of that reefer\nShe used to buy a nigga new sneakers\nPay the bill on my beeper\nJust so she can page to put a \"69\"\nAnd I know it time to go freak her\nThen one day I just asked her\n\"Why you always give your ass up?\nI mean, damn, these hoes get paid\nAll you do is get laid\u2014this shit don't add up.\"\nShe said, \"Tip, all I wanna do is feel love\nEven if I know it ain't real love\nEven if I know a nigga only finna hit it\nAnd then never call back, I still fuck.\"\nAnd that's fucked up, she's so trill\nI need somethin', she go steal\nWhen the trap hot and police ride\nNigga, guess where we go chill?\nFor 'bout four years she held dope\nAnd my four pounds 'til it goes down\nI remember shawty, she stayed down\nI won't say her name, \u2018cause she married now\n\n[Hook: Kris Stephens]\nWhen the lights go out\nAnd I'm in my bed\nI think of all the madness in my head\nAll of the things that I did back then\nWhen I'm in my bed\nI think of all the memories I've had\nAll of the things I did back then\n\n[Verse 2: B.o.B]\nShe would always turn heads when she'd fall through\nShe would always make moves how a boss do\nAnd she never gave any nigga time of day\nBut she the chick all the niggas tried to talk to\nBut when it came to me, she had a thing for me\nWhen we kicked it she roll up the weed for me\nAnd we'd both cut class post up in the cut steady\nWatchin' just to see if the police comin'\nWe got close over time, her and I\nRight around the time that I first got signed\nCome to think about it I was 'bout 17\nI ain't even have a license, couldn't even drive\nI was goin' back and forth with each flight\nAnother show after show, each night\nShe became so suspicious of these other bitches\nShe'd go through my phone and we'd fight\nTalk about torn between the two\nWasn't really much more that we could do\nWasn't really much space for us\nBut she stayed down with every tour she seen me do\nBut I guess one night I had a few\nHuh, one night I had a few\nYeah, this little chick that caught my eye\nI told her: \"Hurry up, meet me at the room!\"\nAnd no, I didn't have a contraceptive\nWhat my common sense neglected\nAnd two months later, next thing I know\nI got a text that said \"I'm pregnant\"\nAnd you can almost bet she kept it\nAnd that's the reason why you left me\nOn top of all that, it wasn't even mine\nI went and got paternity tested\u2014damn!\n\n[Hook: Kris Stephens]\nWhen the lights go out\nAnd I'm in my bed\nI think of all the madness in my head\nAll of the things that I did back then\nWhen I'm in my bed\nI think of all the memories I've had\nAll of the things I did back then\n\n[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]\nWait, hold up, is that you?\nWith them big ol' thighs after school?\nJay 305 had gave me high five\nWhen I said I\u2019m in hot pursuit\nYou said I won\u2019t ride until Kendrick drive\nA new Monte Carlo that cruise\nAnd that shot my pride, I tried to improv\nBut no freestyle I never do\nYou lookin' for the nigga with the tallest 'fetti\nYou overlookin' every nigga that ain\u2019t quite ready\nTo make it rain on you, like I'm about to break a levee\nHold up, that pussy petty\nYeah, your nails did, your hair did\nYour cell phone is selfish\nIt only got numbers that come with a Hummer\nHer new prima donna I smelt it\nTried to make you mine, ho!\nTried to make some time, ho!\nBut I ain\u2019t got the time or the patience\nTo stop and wait in line, ho!\nHer dreams holds Versace\nShe fall for Armani\nOnly deal with rich niggas; fuck you and Mick Romney!\nI\u2019m grown now, I\u2019m on my own now\nI\u2019m po-o-o-oppin'\nChange my phone now when I get home now\nI got o-o-o-options\nFast forward, wait, is that you?\nWith them big ol' thighs after school?\nAnd your three kids and three baby daddies\nAnd car note that\u2019s overdue?

stage.\n\nAround Thanksgiving 2010, just a few weeks before No Mercy was officially released, a version of this song surfaced on the Internet that featured a different Eminem verse and lacked a bridge from T.I., though it\u2019s presumably only a demo.\n\nThis track is produced by Dr. Luke, a renown contributor to T.I.\u2019s other music.\n\nThat is all she wrote folks."}, "comment_count": 1,

say\nMy philosophy profit off of my properties\nGet it, flip it, we got to be rich, that broke shit is obsolete\nPossibly off of my rocker, watch how you watching me\nSophisticated, psychotic, fly as a pilot\nOfficially silent, all you wish you could get I got it\nUnlimited titanium nigga, what's in yo' wallet?\nOut of gladiator college, I made it summa cum laude\nWhere you clowns couldn't have got a cap and gown if you bought it\nI parley with Saudis, buying crude oil and diamonds\nHustle January, July, fly to Dubai\nA broke nigga telling me 'bout how I'm dividing the pies\nLike a blind nigga telling me it's an eye for an eye\nBullheaded and stubborn, I be that way 'til I die\nBut find a nigga with more hustle than me I dare you to try\nAnd according to the hand on my Audemar\nIt's my time to shine, so fuck y'all\n\n[Chorus: Stacy Barthe]\nWhat should I be sorry for?\nWho should I be sorry to?\nWhat should I be sorry for?\nWho should I be sorry to?\nThe fact is you can't please everybody\nYou can't please everybody\nWhat should I be sorry for?\nWho should I be sorry to?\n\n[Verse 2: T.I.]\nI grew up in the gutter, life a motherfucker\nI guess that's why I don't trust a motherfucker\nSeen a nigga snitch on they mom, shoot at they brother\nGo to prison in love with a bitch and a nigga fuck her\nI seen real G's destroyed by real suckers\nInnocent ladies raped and defenseless babies abducted\nSuch a horrible truth, but you see it over and over\nIt's nothing, you numb to it and your heart grow colder\nPacify your pain with a chain and a Rover\nFuck it, justify your action with stacking your dough up\nYou show up with a brick of cocaine and baking soda\nJust enough for me to blow up, nigga hold up\nSwitch the flow up, 'cause these niggas be snitchin' so much\nI promise all they missing's a badge, coffee, and donut\nGo to jail so what, never see my integrity perish\nThat ain't the Harris' way, study my pedigree\nPromise I'm one of the only ones who keep it 100\nProbably why I think they all out to get me, you can't convince me\nLarge money and fame will plant seeds of envy\nTo make my partners resent me enough to come and get me\nCatch me slippin' and hit me, just like they did 50\nCause I'm in the position that he think he should be given\nListen, dawg, the fact of the matter is\nI'm on a narrow path and we all can't travel\n\n[Chorus: Stacy Barthe]\nWhat should I be sorry for?\nWho should I be sorry to?\nWhat should I be sorry for?\nWho should I be sorry to?\nThe fact is you can't please everybody\nYou can't please everybody\nWhat should I be sorry for?\nWho should I be sorry to?\n\n[Verse 3: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nWhat it ain't? What it is? Even if you gotta live\nI learned that apartment is way more exciting than a big ass house on a hill\nI used to be a way better writer and a rapper\nWhen I used to want a black Karmann Ghia\nNow a nigga speeding in a Porsche\nFeeling like I'm going off a course\nCut these fuck niggas off\nNegative in my life, scream that 'til I'm hoarse\nDuck these get the fuck off me projectiles, bitch he ain't really got a choice\nI'm living my life live yours\nI don't even like rapping fast, but that's how the world come to me\nTalk to me sideways nigga that's your ass\nSlow it down, this that shit that'll make you call your momma\nSay, \"Hey, I'm sorry for begging for all them clothes you couldn't afford\"\nAnd this the type of shit that'll make you call your rap partner\nAnd say, \"I'm sorry I'm awkward, my fault for fuckin' up the tours\"\nI hated all the attention so I ran from it (ran from it)\nFuck it if we did, but I hope we ain't lose no fans from it (fans from it)\nI'm a grown-ass kid, you know ain't never cared about no damn money\nWhy do we try so hard to be stars, just to dodge comments?\nAnd this that shit that'll make you call your baby mama\nWhen you gone on half a pill, don't know why but that's how it is\nThen you take a flight back to the crib, y'all make love like college kids\nAnd you say all the shit you gon' do better, we can try this shit again\n'Round the time the dope wear off, you feel stupid, she feel lost\nThat's that dopamine, I mean dope, I mean you think Cupid done worn off\nWaiting in the hallway with her arms crossed\nBaby boy face full of applesauce\nMaybe should have stayed but it ain't yo fault\nToo much pressure, I peel off, I'm sorry\nWas young and had to choose between you\nAnd what the rest of the world might offer me, shit, what would you do?\nWell I'd probably do it differently if second the chance\nOnly if some cool ass older man would've let me know in advance\nThere's this quarry, that is dug so deep in a father's chest\nWhen he feel that he's broken up his nest\nAnd he figured shit he was just doing the best that he could\nWhich end up being the worst that he could\nAnd all some pussy nigga on the Internet can say is that verse ain't good\nIt's boring? Boring? Really?\nWhen I'm disgusted with this world and I can hardly breathe and\nTold so many lies, don't know what to believe\nI discussed it with this girl, and this is what she said\nShe said, \"Lay down baby, baby, rest your weary head up\"\nA lovely distraction but my mind don't wanna rest\nBut my body disagree so I laid up on her breasts, yes\n\"Ooooh, you so fucking fine\"\nI woke up the next morning with new purpose on my mind\nOoooh, who pulls your ponytail?\nWho knows your body well huh?\n\n[Outro: Stacy Barthe]\nWhat should I be sorry for?\nWho should I be sorry to?"}}, {"title": "Dead and Gone", "album": "Paper Trail", "year": "2008-09-29", "lyrics": "[Intro: T.I.]\nAyy, let me kick it to you right quick, man\nNot on some gangsta shit\nMan, on some real shit\nAnybody done been through the same thing\nI'm sure you feel the same way\nBig Phil, this for you, pimpin'\n\n[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & T.I.]\nOhh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)\nJust tryin' to find my way back home (back home)\nThe old me is dead and gone, dead and gone\nAnd ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)\nJust tryin' to find my way back home (back home)\nThe old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey\n\n[Verse 1: T.I.]\nEver had one of them days wish you woulda stayed home\nRun into a group of niggas who gettin' they hate on?\nYou walk by, they get wrong\nYou reply, then shit get blown\nWay outta proportion, way past discussion\nJust you against them, pick one, then rush him\nFigure you get jumped, hell, that's nothin'\nThey don't wanna stop there, now they bustin'\nNow you gushin', ambulance rushin' you\nTo the hospital with a bad concussion\nPlus you hit four times, plus it hit yo' spine\nParalyzed waist-down, now you're wheelchair-bound\nNever mind that now, you lucky to be alive\nJust think, it all started, you fussin' with three guys\nNow your pride in the way, but your pride is the way\nYou could fuck around, get shot, die any day\nNiggas die everyday, all over bullshit\nDope money, dice game, ordinary hood shit\nCould this be \u2018cause of hip hop music?\nOr did the ones with the good sense not use it?\nUsually niggas don't know what to do when\nTheir back against the wall, so they just start shootin'\nFor red or for blue or for blow, I guess\nFrom Bankhead up to yo projects\n\n[Pre-Chorus: T.I.]\nNo more stress, now I'm straight\nNow I get it, now I take\nTime to think before I make\nMistakes just for my family's sake\nThat part of me left yesterday\nThe heart of me is strong today\nNo regrets, I'm blessed to say\nThe old me dead and gone away\n\n[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & T.I.]\nOhh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)\nJust tryin' to find my way back home (back home)\nThe old me is dead and gone, dead and gone\nAnd ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)\nJust tryin' to find my way back home (back home)\nThe old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey\n\n[Verse 2: T.I.]\nI ain't never been scared, I lived through tragic\nSituation coulda been dead lookin' back at it\nMost of that shit didn't even have to happen\nBut you don't think about it when you out there trappin'\nIn apartments, hangin', smokin' and rappin'\nNiggas start shit, next thing you know we cappin'\nGet locked up, then didn't even get mad\nNow think about, damn, what a life I had!\nMost of that shit, look back, just laugh\nSome shit, still look back, get sad\nMaybe my homeboy still be around\nHad I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time\nI won that fight, I lost that war\nI can still see my nigga walkin' out that door\nWho'da thought I'd never see Philant no more?\nGot enough dead homies, I don't want no more\nCost a nigga his jaw, cost me more\nI'da took that ass-whoopin' now for sure\nNow think before I risk my life\nTake them chances to get my stripe\nA nigga put his hands on me, alright\nOtherwise, stand there, talk shit all night\n\u2018Cause I hit you, you sue me\nI shoot you, get locked up, who?

thing\nI'm sure you feel the same way\nBig Phil, this for you, pimpin'\n\n[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & T.I.]\nOhh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)\nJust tryin' to find my way back home (back home)\nThe old me is dead and gone, dead and gone\nAnd ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)\nJust tryin' to find my way back home (back home)\nThe old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey\n\n[Verse 1: T.I.]\nEver had one of them days wish you woulda stayed home\nRun into a group of niggas who gettin' they hate on?\nYou walk by, they get wrong\nYou reply, then shit get blown\nWay outta proportion, way past discussion\nJust you against them, pick one, then rush him\nFigure you get jumped, hell, that's nothin'\nThey don't wanna stop there, now they bustin'\nNow you gushin', ambulance rushin' you\nTo the hospital with a bad concussion\nPlus you hit four times, plus it hit yo' spine\nParalyzed waist-down, now you're wheelchair-bound\nNever mind that now, you lucky to be alive\nJust think, it all started, you fussin' with three guys\nNow your pride in the way, but your pride is the way\nYou could fuck around, get shot, die any day\nNiggas die everyday, all over bullshit\nDope money, dice game, ordinary hood shit\nCould this be \u2018cause of hip hop music?\nOr did the ones with the good sense not use it?\nUsually niggas don't know what to do when\nTheir back against the wall, so they just start shootin'\nFor red or for blue or for blow, I guess\nFrom Bankhead up to yo projects\n\n[Pre-Chorus: T.I.]\nNo more stress, now I'm straight\nNow I get it, now I take\nTime to think before I make\nMistakes just for my family's sake\nThat part of me left yesterday\nThe heart of me is strong today\nNo regrets, I'm blessed to say\nThe old me dead and gone away\n\n[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & T.I.]\nOhh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)\nJust tryin' to find my way back home (back home)\nThe old me is dead and gone, dead and gone\nAnd ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)\nJust tryin' to find my way back home (back home)\nThe old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey\n\n[Verse 2: T.I.]\nI ain't never been scared, I lived through tragic\nSituation coulda been dead lookin' back at it\nMost of that shit didn't even have to happen\nBut you don't think about it when you out there trappin'\nIn apartments, hangin', smokin' and rappin'\nNiggas start shit, next thing you know we cappin'\nGet locked up, then didn't even get mad\nNow think about, damn, what a life I had!\nMost of that shit, look back, just laugh\nSome shit, still look back, get sad\nMaybe my homeboy still be around\nHad I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time\nI won that fight, I lost that war\nI can still see my nigga walkin' out that door\nWho'da thought I'd never see Philant no more?\nGot enough dead homies, I don't want no more\nCost a nigga his jaw, cost me more\nI'da took that ass-whoopin'

you truly do adore 'em\nLike dedicate songs, write poems\nBut they be on that bullshit and you try to ignore 'em\nBut you feel like they feel like you ain\u2019t right for 'em\nTherefore your heart\u2019s torn\nBetween bein' with 'em forever, leavin' 'em never\nBut it seem like you arguin', fightin' over whatever\nMaybe we can leave, find someone better\nEven though you know you\u2019ve never known none better\nMy heart say \"nah, she can\u2019t leave, won't let her\"\nBeen head over heels since the very day I met her\nFell so deep in love I ain\u2019t been able to get up\nSometimes I want some peace of mind and she won\u2019t shut up\nLove her to death, don\u2019t know whether to kiss her or kill her\n\n[Hook: P!nk]\nShould\u2019ve known it\nFrom the start it was already over\nWe were just too dumb to notice\nAnd we'd pray but\nEven love couldn\u2019t save us\nWe'd wake up\nOn a bed of guns and roses\nAnd we don\u2019t know which one to choose\nWhen either way, we\u2019re gonna lose\nStill we'd pray but\nEven love couldn\u2019t save us\nWe'd wake up\nOn a bed of guns and roses\n\n[Verse 2: T.I.]\nI guess I\u2019d rather suffer with her than be miserable without her\nI buy a lot of Prada, Gucci and Balenciaga\nTo keep her content, and keep down the nonsense\nBut every corner we turn around's a conflict\nMostly dumb shit, like who she run with\nWhere the fuck you been? Your pants \u2013 they don\u2019t fit\nReally, honestly speaking, some things I don\u2019t get\nNo matter how much she try she can\u2019t make it make more sense\nTherefore, here we go again\nScreamin', yellin' at the top of our lungs, she goin' in\nSaying the kind of shit I be like \"if you was a man\nI would go in your shit, for real, no shit\"\nBut I love her so much that I can\u2019t forget\nThat the feel of a kiss, it could heal when I\u2019m sick\nStill, I don\u2019t like to feel like this\nIf I didn\u2019t miss her, I would try to get her killed right quick\n\n[Hook: P!nk]\nShould\u2019ve known it\nFrom the start it was already over\nWe were just too dumb to notice\nAnd we'd pray but\nEven love couldn\u2019t save us\nWe'd wake up\nOn a bed of guns and roses\nAnd we don\u2019t know which one to choose\nWhen either way, we\u2019re gonna lose\nStill we'd pray but\nEven love couldn\u2019t save us\nWe'd wake up\nOn a bed of guns and roses\n\n[Bridge: P!nk]\nEvery time we say our goodbyes\nA little piece of my heart breaks off inside\nI don\u2019t really ever know why\nIf I could live without you I\u2019d try\n\n[Hook: P!nk]\nShould\u2019ve known it\nFrom the start it was already over\nWe were just too dumb to notice\nAnd we'd pray but\nEven love couldn\u2019t save us\nWe'd wake up\nOn a bed of guns and roses\nAnd we don\u2019t know which one to choose\nWhen either way, we\u2019re gonna lose\nStill we'd pray but\nEven love couldn\u2019t save us\nWe'd wake up\nOn a bed of guns and roses"}}, {"title": "Niggas In Paris (Remix)", "album": "Back 2 The Throne", "year": "2011-10-15", "lyrics": "[Intro 1: Blades of Glory sample]\nWe're going to skate to one song...one song only\nBall so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me\n\n[Intro 2: T.I.]\nAye man I don't know what been happening\nI guess y'all must have caught amnesia in my absence\nI ain't been gone that long, have I?\nWell, just for y'all reminder\nHow about the crown meet the throne right here\nLet's get it\n\n[Verse 1: T.I. & JAY-Z]\nCall me T.I. -- no CPR, I'm killing shit\nEven in prison I'm still the shit\nBetter recognize King in the building bitch\nAct like you know you serious, I (ball so hard)\nMy ankle hurt, don't buy a car if I ain't the first\nIn the country with a 1, 2, 3 bitch\nYou watch me while I painted her, I (Ball so hard)\nThey hate to see me on the stage Jay-Z, Kanye with me\nYou know I (ball so hard), TIP is scary\nMerci beaucoup in Paris\nParlez vous francais I say, Menage a trois today I say\nI (ball so hard), hard out the park\nMaybach chauffeured, I ain't got to park\nSo Ross, so official dawg\nThem lame can't do nothing with you dawg\nShe all on me, better get your broad\nDon't like that, blow your whistle dawg, I (ball so hard)\nNo referee throw no flag, ain't no techs for me\nI keep them suckas upset with me, them racks back on deck you best believe that I\n\n[Hook]\nBall so hard mothafuckas want to fine me\n(That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray)\n\n[Verse 2: Jay-Z]\nSo I ball so hard mothafuckas want to fine me, first niggas got to find me\nWhat's 50 grand to a mothafucka like me, can you please remind me?\n(Ball so hard) This shit crazy, y'all don't know that don't shit phase me\nThe Nets could go 0 for 82 and I look at you like this shit gravy\n(Ball so hard) This shit weird, we ain't even supposed to be here\n(Ball so hard) Since we here, it's only right that we'd be fair\nPsycho: I'm liable to go Michael, take your pick\nJackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6\n(Ball so hard) Got a broke clock, Rolleys that don't tick tock\nAudemars that's losing time, hidden behind all these big rocks\n(Ball so hard) I'm shocked too, I'm supposed to be locked up too\nIf you escape what I've escaped, you'd be in Paris getting fucked up too\n(Ball so hard) Let\u2019s get faded, Le Meurice for like 6 days\nGold bottles, scold models, spillin\u2019 Ace on my sick J\u2019s\n(Ball so hard) Bitch behave, just might let you meet 'Ye\nChi town's D.

I go to jail if I want that lil bitch\nThey kept me with my strap on my own, that lil bitch\nI don't answer no questions, want speak with my lawyer\nTell your boss I said where my phone call, that's it\nA lot of nigga shit, talkin' you don't ever get paid\nRemember me, I've been bout it, dealin' out the 10th grade\nRidin' round in my homeboy Buick\nWith a tool in the unit\nWe'd go to school, eat lunch\nCut school, get back to it, nigga\nListen nigga, this the Bankroll Mob\nIf you can't go hard then you can't come here\nLet me make somethin' clear\nIf you lookin' for a sucker well it ain't

The song throws a couple subtle jabs towards Atlanta Rapper Shawty Lo (of D4L) at the height of their minor beef. T.I. responds to Shawty Lo\u2019s attacks with something approaching a minor irritation. Considering he was facing up to 25 years in prison at the time, it is easy to see why T.I. wasn\u2019t concerned with a street beef\n\nThe album was due to drop on Sept. 30, 2008; the early leak of this single to Streetcred.com and radio DJs, as well as the instantaneous street buzz, compelled Atlantic Records to move the album release up to August 12, where it made its debut at #1 on the billboard chart and was eventually certified double platinum\n\nThe track was a top 20 rotation on several rap stations nationwide, as well as a top 20 digital download single on Itunes.

about coming to terms with his inevitable court trial on federal weapons charges. The song throws a couple subtle jabs towards Atlanta Rapper Shawty Lo (of D4L) at the height of their minor beef. T.I. responds to Shawty Lo\u2019s attacks with something approaching a minor irritation. Considering he was facing up to 25 years in prison at the time, it is easy to see why T.I. wasn\u2019t concerned with a street beef\n\nThe album was due to drop on Sept. 30, 2008; the early leak of this single to Streetcred.com and radio DJs, as well as the instantaneous street buzz, compelled Atlantic Records to move the album release up to August 12, where it made its debut at #1 on the billboard chart and was eventually certified double platinum\n\nThe track was a top 20 rotation on several rap stations nationwide, as well as a top 20 digital download single on Itunes. In addition, the video was nominated for an MTV video music award in 2008\n\nRC"}, "comment_count": 3, "community": true, "custom_preview": null, "has_voters": true, "id": 3490212, "pinned": false,

to you\n\n[Chorus]\nGo and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat\nHey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?\nHey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?\nHey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?\nIn a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack\nHey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?\nHey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?\nHey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that\u2026\u00a0aye-aye\n\n[Verse 1]\nCan't help but notice how you glowing, I can see in yo' face\nNow, I just wonder if he know he close to being replaced\nSwear I treat you like a queen you put me in his place\nSo you can give back his ring and the key to his place\nTell the nigga one thing, that you need your space\nSelling niggas one thing, you don't need to chase\nI wanna kiss you everywhere between your knees and waist\nHear the sounds that you making, get your knees to shake\nHolla at me in the A, you feel you need to escape\nI got a mansion and a gate, you with me and you safe\nA Benz, a Phantom and a truck with 23's the case\n600 G's in the safe, how much cheese it take?\nThis a chance you need to take, ain't no need to wait\nSay the word, we can leave today, this song's special\nAnd it feel like fate, hate to make a mistake\nHow the same thing making you sad making you stay?\n\n[Chorus]\nGo and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat\nHey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?\nHey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?\nHey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?\nIn a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack\nHey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?\nHey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?\nHey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that\u2026\u00a0aye-aye\n\n[Verse 2]\nCan he touch it like that, and make it feel like this?\nHow I left and came back and it's still like this?\nDo he hit it from the back and make you feel it in your chest?\nTake advantage of what you're concealing in your dress?\nWhat, he think he too fresh to show that you the best?\nCompliment you on your intellect and treat you with respect?\nGive you sex 'til you sweat, tongue kissing on your neck?\nIt's been awhile since she got it like this, I bet\nI can tell you ain't just another bitch I met\nAin't nobody got me open like this, not yet\nYou confused, ain't decided which way you should go yet\nSo how you keep saying no with your panties so wet?\n\n[Chorus]\nGo and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat\nHey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?\nHey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?\nHey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?\nIn a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack\nHey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?\nHey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?\nHey-hey why you wanna go and do

my windshield, keep \u2018em in a clear view\nCheers to my partners who got it, we finally did it\nAnd here\u2019s to the ones with potential to go and get it\nWe survived yesterday, foreign ride connoisseurs\nPopping fly today, tomorrow ain\u2019t promised to us\nGrind hard for dirty money but our heart\u2019s pure\nSteady mobbing on these suckers, man they\u2019re so funny to us\nBroke niggas all smiles when they run into us\nGet by theyself, they talking tough but don\u2019t do nothing to us\nCall themselves paper chasing, when wealth be running to us\nYou violate the Puppet

same\nCan\u2019t complain, I\u2019m highly favored, my flavor\u2019s god given\nSo used to hate appreciation is a odd feeling\nStill I stay focused on the millions, trying to dodge prison\nPraying as

wildside\nWelcome to our lives\nSlangin' keys, spraying K's\nEvery day we getting paid\nTo walk on the wildside\nWelcome to our lives\n\n[Verse 1: T.I.]\nCome take a little walk with me through my neighborhood and come spend a day in my trap\nGet your paper right and that yay some good but just keep a tool in your lap\nMy lil patna holding that work, nigga want weight then keep around back\nBetter not violate on my turf, nigga you's in danger to die like that\nAin't no investigation, no statements and no witnesses, we ain't seen shit\nPull up after dark with that jewelry on to come see a bitch, that way he get it\nWe on dark road with no street lights, that pistol play after fist fights\nAnd them geek monsters walk all night with they crack pipes tryna get right\nMidnight we shoot dice, the whole house smelling like cooked crack\nYou beat me, and you talk shit, you get shot bitch, and I took that\nHoodrats on deck, that loud is all I blow\nThis shit to you might sound wild, but this life is all I know\n\n[Hook: T.I.]\nSmoking weed, riding chrome\nOnly thing I've ever known\nIs walk on the wildside\nWelcome to our lives\nSlangin' keys, spraying K's\nEvery day we getting paid\nTo walk on the wildside\nWelcome to our lives\n\n[Verse 2: T.I.]\nCan you picture me back in '93 bumpin' Dr. Dre while I hit some weed?\nCut school, made ten G; thirteen, trying to get keys\nAt fifteen, I was full-grown, get wrong, get bust on\nMy uncle gave me a bunch of work and that shit was gone by the next morning\nYoung wild nigga runnin' with me, homicide wasn't nothing to us\nDead body wasn't nothin' to see, that pistol play was just fun to us\nI was 19 with two felonies, one of my best friend had a life sentence\nHow my uncle Fred was just like me and had a bunch of partners no longer living\nAll about that cocaine dealing, no education, no pot to piss in\nOld school, on chrome wheel, window tinted, pistol hidden\nThat's the shit that I come from; in my heart, fear ain't none\nStand tall, I can't run from that wildside, that I walk on\n\n[Hook: T.I.]\nSmoking weed, riding chrome\nOnly thing I've ever known\nIs walk on the wildside\nWelcome to our lives\nSlangin' keys, spraying K's\nEvery day we getting paid\nTo walk on the wildside\nWelcome to our lives\n\n[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]\nUh, yeah\nAll I ever did was put on, all my old friends tryna get on\nShorty fell out, making diss songs, never talk down when I get home\nAin't the type of nigga you can shit on; hundred spokes, brick, chrome\nGod body, big bone, that's hard body, Jim Jones\nNiggas know the sound of how we switch on him, finna wild out on a Tip song\nBetter make a toast, nigga, Tip home, first get the bread, then get going\nFrom the land of the lead where they spit chrome where most kids never get to live long\nGet their pistols, get pissed on, pistol-whipped and stripped, homie\nLeft for a minute and they switched on me, caught them talking down, tryna bitch on me\nAnd they snitch on me, ain't got shit on me so my guess is death is what they wish on me\nSo I'm blowing on them candles, closed lids and dark eyes\nCause hate's never part time when you on that wildside\n\n[Hook: T.I.]\nSmoking weed, riding chrome\nOnly thing I've ever known\nIs walk on the wildside\nWelcome to our lives\nSlangin' keys, spraying K's\nEvery day we getting paid\nTo walk on the

somewhere man\nYeah, we hear it so much we probably numb to it by now\nAfter all, it\u2019s the American way right?\n\n[Hook: Skyler Grey]\nHome of the brave and free\nFree just to murder me\nLand of the beautiful\nCursed by the hate we throw\nIs this the new national anthem?\nIs this the new national anthem?\n\n[Interlude: T.I.]\nIt's America, land of the handgun\nHome of the shotgun\nYou're dead if you ain't got one\nIt was like this before I got here, baby I ain't do it!\nI ain't start it, I'm just a part of it\nTurn it!\n\n[Verse 1: T.I.]\nYou say this the home of the brave I guess\nI say this the home of the K\u2019s and the vets\nAll alone with the J\u2019s smoking yay cause he stressed\nOn chrome with a Tek taught to spray for respect\nI learned from the best used to stay in the \u201cjects\u201d\nBought work from the vets burning rubber in the 'Vettes\nThis as good as it gets used to play with the rats\nThen I got older and learned stay away from the rats\nGod blessed this nigga, to hustle up and make eight figures\nTurned from a goon to a great young nigga\nNo complaining just doing what it take young nigga\nI was raised in a decade of hate young nigga\nAlways dodging polices because they hate young niggas\nAnd we hate them too, 38 in him shoe\nAll the changes the system will take him through\nHe ain\u2019t a killer but he will if you make him do it\nHomicide he\u2019ll ride, they\u2019ll put him on trial\nLet him have a life sentence then do it with a smile\nAnd he only 19, he ain\u2019t even had a child\nAs a child, told his mama he\u2019ll be gone for a while\nAnd she cried, still they just put him inside\nNow she all on her own because her other son died\nListen to the politician as he lied and he lied\nHe a snake in a suit, trying to hide in disguise\n\n[Hook: Skyler Grey]\nHome of the brave and free\nFree just to murder me\nLand of the beautiful\nCursed by the hate we throw\nIs this the new national anthem?\nIs this the new national

That make sense?\nTell me why 9 ounces of crack will get you more time than a rape right now?\nTell me why them crazy white boys can tote a gun but I can\u2019t right now?\nYeah I had felonies, I done did dirt in the streets\nBut I ain\u2019t ever gave it to anybody that didn\u2019t deserve it\nYou know what I mean?\nI ain\u2019t ever ran in no public place with no pistol shooting no innocent people\nI ain\u2019t never ran in no school, killing no kids\nMan this is the result of you refusing to deal with the issues at hand\nWe are a product of the environment you placed us in\nWe ain't do

that\u2019s the way we\u2019re going to get ahead\nSitting around waiting on government to do something for us\nAin't never gonna happen partner, they don\u2019t give a fuck about us\nBut don\u2019t

partners looking at me to see if my eyes open\nCause I've been dranking and I've been smoking\nFlying down 285 but I'm focused\n454 SS, I race Porsches\nWhite leather seats, as fresh as Air Forces\nDoing 'bout a hundred but the track still bumping\nNumber 8 on N.W.A, \"Straight Outta Compton\"\nPull up at your apartment sitting on 20 somethings\nAnd the dope boys hollering \"What's happening?\" kid running in\nThe cliques start dancing and the broads start choosing\nAnd the cars been parked but the rims keep moving\nSign pictures, buy an onion of good and throw the deuces\nCause

of Hennessy and Belvedere's what we dranking\nPimp squad send for broads, what the hell you niggas thinking?\nYoung nigga spending weekends on the islands in the fall\n24 inch rim shining when I'm riding cause I'm balling\nI'm calling out shots like a pool shark\nMy tools spark in the dark when I fool marks\nY'all fools hearts in the wrong place at the wrong time, I got a strong mind\nTo grab my chrome nine and shoot at your ass for a long time\nBut I'mma get that ass hauled off, fuck around with the clique\nThey'll be looking for your dick with a stick, nigga y'all soft\nSo y'all lost,

right now\nI'd probably still be trapping if I wasn't rapping right now\nBragging about pistols at the house, guess who's strapped right now\nKeep on talking folk, I'll lay you on your back right

on\n\n[Hook]\nMoney, hoes, cars and clothes\nThat's how all my niggas roll\nBlowing dro on 24's\nThat's how all my niggas roll\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm in a drop-top Chevy with the roof wide open\nMy partners looking at me to see if my eyes open\nCause I've been dranking and I've been smoking\nFlying down 285 but I'm focused\n454 SS, I race Porsches\nWhite leather seats, as fresh as Air Forces\nDoing 'bout a hundred but the track still bumping\nNumber 8 on N.W.A, \"Straight Outta Compton\"\nPull up at your apartment sitting on 20 somethings\nAnd the dope boys hollering \"What's happening?\" kid running in\nThe cliques start dancing and the broads start choosing\nAnd the cars been parked but the rims keep moving\nSign pictures, buy an onion of good and throw the deuces\nCause I ain't Hollywood, I come from the hood, I'm used to it\nIf your rear view shaking and your seats vibrating\n24 inch Dayton's got the Chevrolet skatin' makin'\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nI make a million and I'm satisfied, I'll get the rest\nUnderaged civilian in the tigthest ride, I want the best\nI refuse to get a 9 to 5, I'mma flip my keys\nBeen paying my dues since '89, tryna get my cheese\nDiamonds gleam when I'm on the scene, they know it's me\nAin't no dream or no fantasy bitch, it's T-I-P\nBroad busting, like a baby do a binky\nFive karat DVS's on my mothafuckin' pinkie\nHalf of Hennessy and Belvedere's what we dranking\nPimp squad send for broads, what the hell you niggas thinking?\nYoung nigga spending weekends on the islands in the fall\n24 inch rim shining when I'm riding cause I'm balling\nI'm calling out shots like a pool shark\nMy tools spark in the dark when I fool marks\nY'all fools hearts in the wrong place at the wrong time, I got a strong mind\nTo grab my chrome nine and shoot at your ass for a long time\nBut I'mma get that ass hauled off, fuck around with the clique\nThey'll be looking for your dick with a stick, nigga y'all soft\nSo y'all lost, I'mma ball out at all costs, spit game to a dame\nMake her ride on this thang 'til she falls off and sucks balls off, I got the\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm not boucing little shorty, I'm relaxing right now\nI'd probably still be trapping if I wasn't rapping right now\nBragging about pistols at the house, guess who's strapped right now\nKeep on talking folk, I'll lay you on your back right now\nWant to act right now, get smacked right now\nI'm a buck mothafucka, I don't know how to back down\nClown down here fakin', frontin', talking \u2018bout what you making: nothin\u2019\nI'm 21 and 10 years deep, that shit to me ain't nothing\nI'm raised by the niggas getting head from the jays\nLose your leg when I spray, end up dead from the K\nStay ready for the raid, paid heavy from the yay'\nI told my class to kiss my ass, I make 11 everyday\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "Wonderful Life", "album": "Trouble Man: Heavy Is the Head", "year": "2012-12-18", "lyrics": "[Intro: Akon]\n1, 2, 3 -

looking in yo daughter\u2019s eyes\nKickin it with your sons, trippin, never realize\nHow good you got it, been so wrapped up in yo losses\nYou couldn\u2019t see the profits, could still be in the projects\nInstead releasing projects just poppin when niggas floppin\nSo you went back to prison TIP, it could've been a coffin\nNow since we talkin, you been trippin ever since I died\nAppreciate you missin me but G, you still alive\nI\u2019m lookin down at you, and sendin smiles to you\nI checked the wedding out, oh tell Tamika hi would you?\nTold you she would get you, that\u2019s good cuz shawty ride with you\nKids getting big, seen King riding a bicycle\nSee Niq Niq drive a car, see Bubba big as you\nI see Domani rappin, and he\u2019s spittin too\nLittle Deyjah beautiful, and Major supercool\nMy life is over with dawg, your life is good to you\n\n[Hook: Akon]\nAnd you can tell everybody, this is your song\nAnd you can tell everybody, this is your song\nI hope you don\u2019t

that you would listen to\nI never knew the time that I ain\u2019t get to spend with you\nWould ever result in you making yourself miserable\nYou gotta let it go, it\u2019s painful, I already know\nThe past is the past, just learn from the grown\nSo you got crystal wit you? And your sister Precious too\nI\u2019m proud of you, did better than I expected you to\nAlthough I knew you was special when you was smaller\nThat\u2019s why I was so much harder on you, knew you were smarter\nNot much convo to offer, I wasn\u2019t much of a talker\nGreat to see you doin better than me, even as a father\nTaking care of yo mama, overcoming the drama\nYour life is wonderful son, don\u2019t let em take it from you\nKeep living it to the fullest, treasure it, it\u2019s a blessing\nBe thankful for all this beauty, when it\u2019s over with forget it\n\n[Hook: Akon]\n\n[Verse 3]\nDamn...\nWhat up, Phil?

And this pain I feel it never goes away\nDoes it? This load I carry get no lighter\nI grew up all on my own with a broken heart and a broken home\nTaught me everything I\u2019ve known, owe you everything I own\nI must admit you raised a warrior, my life could be a story book\nHope you proud of me, didn\u2019t graduate from college but\nThanks for listening to me, so long, had this bottled up\nTil we meet in person let\u2019s keep speaking through my verses for life\n\n[Hook: Akon]\n\n[Outro: Akon]\nThis is your song...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6c270013a37f81fa5c7f0606f8824d12.300x300x1.png", "artist": "T.I.", "raw": {"annotation_count": 22, "api_path": "/songs/103547", "apple_music_id": "1437479268", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/103547/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "The first verse of the song is T.I\u2019s best friend, Philant who was shot dead, speaking down from heaven to T.I.

(Smellin' the gas)\nI said I got a ID, I got glaucoma (I got ID)\nHe said, \"We ain't in Cali nigga, get out, put your hands up\"\nRunnin' real hard shook the taser (shook the taser)\nRunnin' real hard shook the taser (shook the taser)\nI told him can we split it, we gon' shake 'em\nNigga hit my phone when you made it (brrp)\nOut of here, PJ to Jamaica\nNaw I ain't tell ya wrong, get the paper\nBeen fightin' too long against haters\nMy attitude, yeah I'm going for the shaders\n\n[Verse 2: Rara]\nLive from the cracks of the concrete\n12 try to take a nigga off the street\nMake the gun sound off for Mike Brown\nTake a nigga life when you face down\nHoodie gang strong like Trayvon\nGun by the window like Detroit Red\nBring that shit by the neck of my woods\nAnd bet a nigga ass end up dead\nPig in a blanket, fuck was you thinkin'?\nFree that nigga Boosie, runnin' at the police\nLeft him with a slow leak, right outside VC\nTryna keep a Phantom like DC\nHangout the G like free Meek\nKill a nigga reachin' for a cell phone\nHurt to tell his mama he ain't comin' home\nThat's why I stay strapped all summer long\nAnd you know it\n\n[Chorus: Quavo]\nBlack man, drop top\nThere go the cops\nThere go the cops\nThere go the cops\nIs it because of my people?\nIs it because of my sneakers?\nIs it because of my jersey?\nIt is because that you nervous? (damn)\n\n[Verse 3: Meek Mill]\nBlack man\nRunning from the law like Pac-Man\nTry and throw the RAW all in the trash can\nGot smoked by a cop on the dash cam\nMug shot on the news, he a mad man\nWhen all he did was hustle to run the cash in\nHe feedin' kids in jail if he wasn't crackin'\nToo many felonies on my jacket\nAll of my brothers turn to assassins\nWe seen too many brothers get put in caskets\nToo many young baby mothers and baby daddies\nIn the graveyard back then\nI went from sittin' on clubs to the cashmere\nYou shoulda seen how I flossed on 'em last year\nTwo Maybachs and I had a bad year\nYoung nigga countin' money like a cashier\nWhite man wanna pay me like I'm U-N-O\nNiggas wanna see me at my funeral\nNeither of my own homie wanna do me though\nLayin' on my dog crib like I'm Snoopy though\nThat's my nigga, I ain't even wanna do it though\nIf I don't do it, shit I know he gon' do me though\nCause he broke and he trippin' 'bout stupid hoes\nBut I'm a Don just like motherfuckin' Julio\nBlack man\n\n[Chorus: Quavo]\nBlack man, drop top\nThere go the cops\nThere go the cops\nThere go the cops\nIs it because of my people?\nIs it because of my sneakers?\nIs it because of my jersey?\nIt is because that I'm perfect?\n\n[Verse 4: T.I.]\nPolice see I got my hands up\nStill wanna kill me, they don't understand us\nThey be lookin' for a reason just to shoot me\nAnd wanna do me how they do us in the movies\nOr how they do it out in Baton Rouge\nOr Ferguson, or Florida, or Baltimore, they make excuses\nLike I did cause I thought he had a pistol\nOr I did it cause I thought he was a Muslim\nMy message to America, felon or death here\nThe liquor we die, we just substances left here\nFirst you put us in a small hood\nAnd then you beat us and you treat us like it's all good\nAnd then shoot us and you screw us economically, mentally\nKillin' nigga, no penalty, they can do that shit legally\nBet I can make that ass think 'fore you shoot\nYou kill me, man there gon' be more of some riotin' and lootin'\nWe say black lives matter, you say all lives\nBut y'all ain't the ones gettin' hogtied\nPersecuted, executed, one day it gon' be time for retribution\nHope you don't ever see your son in an institution\nI know karma is constant and God ain't no nonsense\nYou doin' wrong just to run shit\nOne day the time gon' run out for the dumb shit\nAin't no deception, tryna get in Heaven\nYou gettin' nailed, bet it's on your Mary\nAnd you know what you did for who how much you really care\nAnd what you really felt, he gon' deny the opportunity to unify\nWith people who look similar to you and I\nCause he don't wanna have a\n\n[Chorus: Quavo]\nBlack man, drop top\nThere go the cops\nThere go the cops\nThere go the cops\nIs it because of my people?\nIs it because of my sneakers?\nIs it because of my jersey?\nIt is because that you nervous?\nBlack man, drop top\nThere go the cops\nThere go the cops\nThere go the cops\nIs it

"lyrics": "[Intro]\nHate the price of fame 'coz it cost too much (yeah boy)\nAnd you lame niggas talk too much (yeah)\nI'm ready for whatever, somebody better tell 'em (yeah boy)\nI said I'm ready for whatever, hey hey\n\n[Verse 1]\nEven though my head in the clouds, I'm planted on the pavement\nHow I walk around, people starin' at amazement\nAnd I play a lot of game on where I be and I ain't playin with it\nThey so judgmental, maybe they don't understand\nIf your life was in jeopardy e'ryday, is you tellin me\nYou wouldn't need weaponry just because of your felony?\nConsider this at least, I got e'rybody sweatin me\nOn the streets is people who won't rest unless I rest in peace\nKilled my folk a year ago, still in my sleep they threaten me\nParanoia stressin me, ain't nobody protectin me\nI'm dealin with the pressure from my partner dyin next to me\nNo one's arrested, they comin for me eventually\nThis was all the things I was goin through mentally\nThis could be the reason I ignored the penitentiary\nNot mentioning New Orlean niggas comin in the city\nKillin all summer long, ain't nobody payin attention\n\n[Bridge]\nNow, is it that hard to understand if you listen?\nEither die or go to jail, that's a hell of a decision\nBut I'm wrong and I know it, my excuses aren't important\nI'm just tryna let you know that I ain't think I had a choice, for real\n\n[Hook]\nI had straps in my ride, gotta go to prison\nYou waiting on me to die, you gon' be waiting for a minute\nReady for whatever, somebody better tell 'em\nI be here when the smoke clears and everythin settles, for real\nCan't afford the price of fame 'coz it cost too much\nPlus these sucka niggas lame and they talk too much\nReady for whatever, somebody better tell 'em\nI be here when the smoke clears and everythin settles, for real\n\n[Post-Hook]\nFor real, for real, ay, for real\nI say, when e'rything settles, for real\nAy, for real, ay, for real\nI say, when e'rything settles for real\n\n[Interlude (over Post-Hook)]\nYeah, I know what you thinking\n\"First Michael Vick, now this, huh?\"\nNaw, not exactly\nI tell you how this shit went down for real, dog\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm a man, I ain't perfect, I admit it, I'm guilty\nBut understand, feel me, I was ridin filthy\n'Coz niggas out there plottin, to rob me and kill me\n500 thousand every year spent on security\nAnd my future was bright, but now it's gettin blurry\n'Coz niggas in a hurry to find me and bury me\nBut surely, God'll deliver me up out it\nI'm a fighter to the heart, I forever be about it\nI'm a father to my sons, asset to my community\nLook at all that I done, my good weigh the negativity\nMentally, I was focused on not lettin history\nRepeat itself, that\u2019s why heat was kept in the vicinity\nYes, officially, I broke the law but not maliciously\nThrough all of the publicity, was anyone considerin\nMy position and the logic hid in my decision?\nBut they caught me with it, now I'm off to prison, period\n\n[Bridge]\nBut is it that hard to understand if you listen?\nEither die or go to jail, that's a hell of a decision\nBut I'm wrong and I know it my excuses ain't important\nI'm just tryna let you know that I ain't think I had a choice, for real\n\n[Hook]\nI had straps in my ride, gotta go to prison\nYou waiting on me to die, you gon' be waiting for a minute\nReady for whatever, somebody better tell 'em\nI be here when the smoke clears and everythin settles, for real\nCan't afford the price of fame 'coz it cost too much\nPlus these sucka niggas lame and they talk too much\nReady for whatever, somebody better tell 'em\nI be here when the smoke clears and everythin settles, for real\n\n[Post-Hook]\nFor real, for real, ay, for real\nI say, when e'rything settles, for real\nAy, for real, ay, for real\nI say, when e'rything settles for real\n\n[Outro (Spoken)]\nAy, I said listen, homeboy. You can talk all you want, mayne, you know what I'm saying? Everybody talk to the King, you know what I'm sayin? Everybody's entitled to an opinion, you know what I'm sayin? They like yesterdays, everybody got one\nBut the fact of the matter remains: if you ain't walk a mile in my shoes and you ain't lived a day in my life, you ain't survive the shit I done survived, you ain't had to deal with the shit I had to deal with, homeboy\u2014you can't muhfuckin' judge me, partner\nI mean, look at folk like Sean Taylor. You know what they said?\nThey said, had he had a strap, he'da lived today. You know what I'm sayin?\nNow, true enough, I was dead wrong, I broke the law, I deserve to be punished. I understand that, aight? Cool. But listen, man, I got a house full of kids, a mama, and an old lady, whose life is my responsibility. You dig that?\nNow, for all of y'all who think I was just ridin' around on some dumb shit: you know I'm smarter than you man! You know I'm smarter than you dawg! Ay, if you think I was just being stupid, shawty, I got some muhfuckin' oceanfront property in Idaho for sale, homie. If you believe that, I got a bridge in Brooklyn I wanna sell you, partner\nAy, man, real talk: In order to understand my train of thoughts, you have to put yourself in my position. You can't expect me to think like you, 'cause my life ain't like yours, you know what I'm sayin?\nIf you don't understand that, you don't understand English.

ready for whatever, hey hey\n\n[Verse 1]\nEven though my head in the clouds, I'm planted on the pavement\nHow I walk around, people starin' at amazement\nAnd I play a lot of game on where I be and I ain't playin with it\nThey so judgmental, maybe they don't understand\nIf your life was in jeopardy e'ryday, is you tellin me\nYou wouldn't need weaponry just because of your felony?\nConsider this at least, I got e'rybody sweatin me\nOn the streets is people who won't rest unless I rest in peace\nKilled my folk a year ago, still in my sleep they threaten me\nParanoia stressin me, ain't nobody protectin me\nI'm dealin with the pressure from my partner dyin next to me\nNo one's arrested, they comin for me eventually\nThis was all the things I was goin through mentally\nThis could be the reason I ignored the penitentiary\nNot mentioning New Orlean niggas comin in the city\nKillin all summer long, ain't nobody payin attention\n\n[Bridge]\nNow, is it that hard to understand if you listen?\nEither die or go to jail, that's a hell of a decision\nBut I'm wrong and I know it, my excuses aren't important\nI'm just tryna let you know that I ain't think I had a choice, for real\n\n[Hook]\nI had straps in my ride, gotta go to prison\nYou waiting on me to die, you gon' be waiting for a minute\nReady for whatever, somebody better tell 'em\nI be here when the smoke clears and everythin settles, for real\nCan't afford the price of fame 'coz it cost too much\nPlus these sucka niggas lame and they talk too much\nReady for whatever, somebody better tell 'em\nI be here when the smoke clears and everythin settles, for real\n\n[Post-Hook]\nFor real, for real, ay, for real\nI say, when e'rything settles, for real\nAy, for real, ay, for real\nI say, when e'rything settles for real\n\n[Interlude (over Post-Hook)]\nYeah, I know what you thinking\n\"First Michael Vick, now this, huh?\"\nNaw, not exactly\nI tell you how this shit went down for real, dog\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm a man, I ain't perfect, I admit it, I'm guilty\nBut understand, feel me, I was ridin filthy\n'Coz niggas out there plottin, to rob me and kill me\n500 thousand every year spent on security\nAnd my future was bright, but now it's gettin blurry\n'Coz niggas in a hurry to find me and bury me\nBut surely, God'll deliver me up out it\nI'm a fighter to the heart, I forever be about it\nI'm a father to my sons, asset to my community\nLook at all that I done, my good weigh the negativity\nMentally, I was focused on not lettin history\nRepeat itself, that\u2019s why heat was kept in the vicinity\nYes, officially, I broke the law but not maliciously\nThrough all of the publicity, was anyone considerin\nMy position and the logic hid in my decision?\nBut they caught me with it, now I'm off to prison, period\n\n[Bridge]\nBut is it that hard to understand if you listen?\nEither die or go to jail, that's a hell of a decision\nBut I'm wrong and I know it my excuses ain't important\nI'm just tryna let you know that I ain't think I had a choice, for real\n\n[Hook]\nI had straps in my ride, gotta go to prison\nYou waiting on me to die, you gon' be waiting for a minute\nReady for whatever, somebody better tell 'em\nI be here when the smoke clears and everythin settles, for real\nCan't afford the price of fame 'coz it cost too much\nPlus these sucka niggas lame and they talk too much\nReady for whatever, somebody better tell 'em\nI be here when the smoke clears and everythin settles, for real\n\n[Post-Hook]\nFor real, for real, ay, for real\nI say, when e'rything settles, for real\nAy, for real, ay, for real\nI say, when e'rything settles for real\n\n[Outro (Spoken)]\nAy, I said listen, homeboy. You can talk all you want, mayne, you know what I'm saying? Everybody talk to the King, you know what I'm sayin? Everybody's entitled to an opinion, you know what I'm sayin? They like yesterdays, everybody got one\nBut the fact of the matter remains: if you ain't walk a mile in my shoes and you ain't lived a day in my life, you ain't survive the shit I done survived, you ain't had to deal with the shit I had to deal with, homeboy\u2014you can't muhfuckin' judge me, partner\nI mean, look at folk like Sean Taylor. You know what they said?\nThey said, had he had a strap, he'da lived today. You know what I'm sayin?\nNow, true enough, I was dead wrong, I broke the law, I deserve to be punished. I understand that, aight? Cool. But listen, man, I got a house full of kids, a mama, and an old lady, whose life is my responsibility. You dig that?\nNow, for all of y'all who think I was just ridin' around on some dumb shit: you know I'm smarter than you man! You know I'm smarter than you dawg! Ay, if you think I was just being stupid, shawty, I got some muhfuckin' oceanfront property in Idaho for sale, homie. If you believe that, I got a bridge in Brooklyn I wanna sell you, partner\nAy, man, real talk: In order to understand my train of thoughts, you have to put yourself in my position. You can't expect me to think like you, 'cause my life ain't like yours, you know what I'm sayin?\nIf you don't understand that, you don't understand English. I'm done talking"}}, {"title": "Hallelujah", "album": "Trouble Man: Heavy Is the Head", "year": "2012-12-18", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nJesus loves me\nThis I know\nFor the Bible tells me so\n\n[Verse 1: T.I.]\nSometimes I wake up feel like I\u2019m in Forest City, Arkansas\nAlthough I\u2019m free I\u2019m still a prisoner of all I saw\nSometimes I leave this booth at 4 am, and ride down Simpson\nJust prayin homie, and reminiscin\nSometimes my nightmare seems so real, feel like I\u2019m still in prison\nI reach out for Tameeka hand, I\u2019m trippin cuz she missin'\nIt\u2019s pitch black dark, like I\u2019m in solitary\nSo if my freedom was a dream, Lord please prepare me\nIt seems like satan want my soul and he refuse to share me\nMy former friends talk about me like I\u2019m dead and buried\nBastards want me in the casket for my head cold\nTrouble in my soul, the devil got a hold\nDid everything to me but kill me, like he did to Job\nHe took my diamonds, took my rhymes, took my fame and gold\nHe took my business interest, he took my wife and kids\nBut he can\u2019t take nothing God can\u2019t give me back again\n\n[Hook]\nHallelujah, hallelujah\nHallelujah, hallelujah\nHallelujah, hallelujah\nHallelujah, hallelujah\n\n[Verse 2: T.I.]\nI went to jail, stood tall, then I fell again\nIt seems like I\u2019m Jonah and right back in that whale again\nI felt the panic when they locked me in that cell again\nI had to pray and meditate, control my breath again\nLike Lazarus I\u2019ve risen from a bed of death again\nThe Lord is with me, I could stand against a thousand men\nI read the songs of David, prayed to be like Solomon\nGod\u2019s wisdom walkin all amongst these hollow men\nI\u2019m a king, I dare to lead when they just follow men\nI see a better way, I\u2019m keeping my eyes on the sparrow\nI\u2019m exiting my Egypt, tell em wave goodbye to pharaoh\nMother told me before she left this earth that I was special\nAnd because I\u2019m special, they gon make me suffer\nLike they crucified Jesus right in front his mother\nSuckas, but he arose on the 3rd day\nTo save, you're here to give favor, let the church say\n\n[Hook]\nHallelujah, hallelujah\nHallelujah, hallelujah\n\n[Outro]\nJesus loves me\nThis I know\nFor the Bible tells me so\nYes, He loves me\nThis I know\nFor the Bible tells me so", "image":

"[Intro]\nJesus loves me\nThis I know\nFor the Bible tells me so\n\n[Verse 1: T.I.]\nSometimes I wake up feel like I\u2019m in Forest City, Arkansas\nAlthough I\u2019m free I\u2019m still a prisoner of all I saw\nSometimes I leave this booth at 4 am, and ride down Simpson\nJust prayin homie, and reminiscin\nSometimes my nightmare seems so real, feel like I\u2019m still in prison\nI reach out for Tameeka hand, I\u2019m trippin cuz she missin'\nIt\u2019s pitch black dark, like I\u2019m in solitary\nSo if my freedom was a dream, Lord please prepare me\nIt seems like satan want my soul and he refuse to share me\nMy former friends talk about me like I\u2019m dead and buried\nBastards want me in the casket for my head cold\nTrouble in my soul, the devil got a hold\nDid everything to me but kill me, like he did to Job\nHe took my diamonds, took my rhymes, took my fame and gold\nHe took my business interest, he took my wife and kids\nBut he can\u2019t take nothing God can\u2019t give me back again\n\n[Hook]\nHallelujah, hallelujah\nHallelujah, hallelujah\nHallelujah, hallelujah\nHallelujah, hallelujah\n\n[Verse 2: T.I.]\nI went to jail, stood tall, then I fell again\nIt seems like I\u2019m Jonah and right back in that whale again\nI felt the panic when they locked me in that cell again\nI had to pray and meditate, control my breath again\nLike Lazarus I\u2019ve risen from a bed of death again\nThe Lord is with me, I could stand against a thousand men\nI read the songs of David, prayed to be like Solomon\nGod\u2019s wisdom walkin all amongst these hollow men\nI\u2019m a king, I dare to lead when they just follow men\nI see a better way, I\u2019m keeping my eyes on the sparrow\nI\u2019m exiting my Egypt, tell em wave goodbye to pharaoh\nMother told me before she left this earth that I was special\nAnd because I\u2019m special, they gon make me suffer\nLike they crucified Jesus right in front his mother\nSuckas, but he arose on the 3rd day\nTo save, you're here to give favor, let the church say\n\n[Hook]\nHallelujah, hallelujah\nHallelujah, hallelujah\n\n[Outro]\nJesus loves me\nThis I know\nFor the Bible tells me so\nYes, He loves me\nThis I know\nFor the Bible tells me so"}}, {"title": "Money Talk", "album": null, "year": "2016-02-16", "lyrics": "[Produced by C4 and KIP]\n\n[Intro]\nHey, you know, a lot of y'all out there man really running y'all

you what you do, take your 2 cents\nKick rocks to a fountain, pitching to make a wish\nShit, if wishes had wings, they\u2019d all make it to heaven\nAnd we\u2019d all be kings\nHahaha, if wishes had wings, they\u2019d all make it to heaven\nAnd we\u2019d all be kings, yeah"}}, {"title": "Big Shit Poppin' (Do It)", "album": "T.I. vs T.I.P.", "year": "2007-05-29", "lyrics": "[Hook]\nHey, hey, what

because she know it ain't a problem to\nYou do somethin' to them and to you I'll bring the drama to\nYou do it for a day or so, we do it for a month or two\nI do it for my partners, go make sure them niggas stuntin' too\nWe do it with them choppers\nAin't no problem, where you runnin' to?\nWe do it for the block, that's why ain't nobody stoppin' me\nI do it for my pop and my cousins too, they watchin' me\nI did it nonstop, now see how these niggas copy me\nI made it from the bottom to the top where I oughta be\nWho do it did good and do it did fresh\nNo matter what I do, you know I do it

these castle walls\nThese castle walls\nIf I should tumble if I should fall\nWould any one hear me screaming behind these castle walls\nThere's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls\n\n[Verse 1: T.I.]\nObserving the estate through the gate from the outside looking in\nBet you would think I got it made, better look again\nI got a butler, got a maid, and a mansion\nThe belief is that I'm living out a millionaire's fantasy\nWith phantoms and ferrari's in the driveway\nBut you see the fame's in exchange for the same man's sanity\nYour vision jaded by the Grammy's on the mantelpiece\nJust switch your camera lenses you would see the agony\nApparently it's damaging the man you see before you\nOn the canvas he may seem alright but all the diasadvantages his family\nEncounters overshadows his extravagance\nWalk in my nines a while I dare you, would it scare you\nWhile it surely seem like King's life ain't glamourous\nAs seen through the eyes of untrained amateurs\nBecause the camera doesn't see beyond the walls of the smiles\nOnly counts until it falls in the pile\n\n[Hook: Christina Aguilera]\nEveryone thinks that I have it all\nBut it's so empty living behind these castle walls\nThese castle walls\nIf I should tumble if I should fall\nWould any one hear me screaming behind these castle walls\nThere's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls\n\n[Verse 2: T.I.]\nHonestly to me, I think I'd lose every benefit of all that I've accomplished\nIf my kids never win at shit\nMe knowing this, why should the verses I have laid\nBe more important to me than the persons I have raised\nI guess I'm saying that to say that opportunity\nBut they just don't equate to all the time they take away\nFrom the kids all the shit I did right is a mistake\nIf deyjah end up a stripper and major slinging yay\nHow could I ever consider myself a great\nIf Messiah ain't paid and Nique Nique ain't straight\nWould your favourite song about the whips, money and shit\nBe relevant if you found out, Domani wasn't rich, nope\nSo me being the G.O.A.T. shouldn't mean more to me\nThan seeing to it King go\nFrom a badass kid to a man with some dough\nOtherwise I may as well have stayed poor\nOtherwise I may well have stayed poor\nSo while they stay focused on me beefin with Flip\nShawty Lo, Gucci or Ludacris\nOr if I'm fucking with a ho\nDid I snitch when I got arrested or will I die over nonesense\nInternally I'm dealing with this conflict\nSo excuse me if I don't get the chance to kiss the hand\nThat slap me in the face, ay I'm just a man\nIf they saying I ain't the best at making hit records\nIt's cause this my life these ain't just rapping\nShit, you think of that deep, did you dawg\nSee you can't see the castle through the walls till it falls\nBitch ain't thinking with the deep, did you dawg\nCause see you can't see the castle through the walls till it falls\n\n[Hook: Christina Aguilera]\nEveryone thinks that I have it all\nBut it's so empty living behind these castle walls\nThese castle walls\nIf I should tumble if I should fall\nWould any one hear me screaming behind these castle walls\nThere's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls\n\n[Bridge: Christina Aguilera]\nNobody knows I'm all alone\nLiving in this castle made of stone\nThey say that money is freedom, but I feel trapped inside it all\nAnd while I sit so high up on a throne\nI wonder how I can feel this low\nOn top of the world it's beautiful\nBut there's no place to fall\n\n[Verse 3: T.I.]\nFor the record ay, I give a damn if I never said shit again\nMy career was meant for me to come and tell it\nHonest interpretation of how affected I'm faced with\nMatters most rappers used to keep locked away in the basement\nBut the day that I walk away I ain't saying that I'm amazing\nDown playing the way I kept fellas from catching cases\nWon't take into consideration how much it mean what I'm saying\nAnd when I say what I mean even when I'm surrounded by the fakest\nFrom one of the greatest sinners, blessed with most of God's graces\nWho made his way amongst the greatest from the grimiest places\nSo next time you rating royalty, I'm always being given to recordings than the level\nOf your loyalty, obvious you've been ignoring me\nWho else you seen make it through the storm, unharmed disjointed\nWhile all the critics was looking

walls\nIf I should tumble if I should fall\nWould any one hear me screaming behind these castle walls\nThere's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls\n\n[Verse 1: T.I.]\nObserving the estate through the gate from the outside looking in\nBet you would think I got it made, better look again\nI got a butler, got a maid, and a mansion\nThe belief is that I'm living out a millionaire's fantasy\nWith phantoms and ferrari's in the driveway\nBut you see the fame's in exchange for the same man's sanity\nYour vision jaded by the Grammy's on the mantelpiece\nJust switch your camera lenses you would see the agony\nApparently it's damaging the man you see before you\nOn the canvas he may seem alright but all the diasadvantages his family\nEncounters overshadows his extravagance\nWalk in my nines a while I dare you, would it scare you\nWhile it surely seem like King's life ain't glamourous\nAs seen through the eyes of untrained amateurs\nBecause the camera doesn't see beyond the walls of the smiles\nOnly counts until it falls in the pile\n\n[Hook: Christina Aguilera]\nEveryone thinks that I have it all\nBut it's so empty living behind these castle walls\nThese castle walls\nIf I should tumble if I should fall\nWould any one hear me screaming behind these castle walls\nThere's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls\n\n[Verse 2: T.I.]\nHonestly to me, I think I'd lose every benefit of all that I've accomplished\nIf my kids never win at shit\nMe knowing this, why should the verses I have laid\nBe more important to me than the persons I have raised\nI guess I'm saying that to say that opportunity\nBut they just don't equate to all the time they take away\nFrom the kids all the shit I did right is a mistake\nIf deyjah end up a stripper and major slinging yay\nHow could I ever consider myself a great\nIf Messiah ain't paid and Nique Nique ain't straight\nWould your favourite song about the whips, money and shit\nBe relevant if you found out, Domani wasn't rich, nope\nSo me being the G.O.A.T. shouldn't mean more to me\nThan seeing to it King go\nFrom a badass kid to a man with some dough\nOtherwise I may as well have stayed poor\nOtherwise I may well have stayed poor\nSo while they stay focused on me beefin with Flip\nShawty Lo, Gucci or Ludacris\nOr if I'm fucking with a ho\nDid I snitch when I got arrested or will I die over nonesense\nInternally I'm dealing with this conflict\nSo excuse me if I don't get the chance to kiss the hand\nThat slap me in the face, ay I'm just a man\nIf they saying I ain't the best at making hit records\nIt's cause this my life these ain't just rapping\nShit, you think of that deep, did you dawg\nSee you can't see the castle through the walls till it falls\nBitch ain't thinking with the deep, did you dawg\nCause see you can't see the castle through the walls till it falls\n\n[Hook: Christina Aguilera]\nEveryone thinks that I have it all\nBut it's so empty living behind these castle walls\nThese castle walls\nIf I should tumble if I should fall\nWould any one hear me screaming behind these castle walls\nThere's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls\n\n[Bridge: Christina Aguilera]\nNobody knows I'm all alone\nLiving in this castle made of stone\nThey say that money is freedom, but I feel trapped inside it all\nAnd while I sit so high up on a throne\nI wonder how I can feel this low\nOn top of the world it's beautiful\nBut there's no place to fall\n\n[Verse 3: T.I.]\nFor the record ay, I give a damn if I never said shit again\nMy career was meant for me to come and tell it\nHonest interpretation of how affected I'm faced with\nMatters most rappers used to keep locked away in the basement\nBut the day that I walk away I ain't saying that I'm amazing\nDown playing the way I kept fellas from catching cases\nWon't take into consideration how much it mean what I'm saying\nAnd when I say what I mean even when I'm surrounded by the fakest\nFrom one of the greatest sinners, blessed with most of God's graces\nWho made his way amongst the greatest from the grimiest places\nSo next time you rating royalty, I'm always being given to recordings than the level\nOf your loyalty, obvious you've been ignoring me\nWho else you seen make it through the storm, unharmed disjointed\nWhile all the critics was looking for Prince Charming\nDisregarded the king of the south raised doubt\nEven though he made a castle out of what used to be a house\nHe did shit that all your favorites rappers only rap about\nBut most of y'all don't see the castle through the walls\nAnd the smiles till it falls in piles so while\n\n[Hook: Christina Aguilera]\nEveryone thinks that I have it all\nBut it's so empty living behind these castle walls\nThese castle walls\nIf I should tumble if I should fall\nWould any one hear me screaming behind these castle walls\nThere's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls"}}, {"title": "Motivation", "album": "Urban Legend",

haters get on yo job, nigga (Motivation)\nNigga, get on yo job, tell'em, haters get on yo job, nigga (Motivation)\nHaters better get on yo job, tell'em, haters get on yo job, nigga (It's motivation)\nSucka nigga, get on yo job, if ya, hatin' get on yo job, nigga\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou can look me in my eyes, see I'm ready for whatever\nAnythang don't kill me, make me better\nI ain't dead nigga, you can take the fame and the chedda\nAnd the game, any deal, I'm still a go-getter\nTake my freedom for the moment but it ain't fo-ever\nI got the spirit of a god, heart of a dope dealer\nI'm a king, seen hangin' with some cold killas\nI ain't never back down or ran from no nigga\nI ain't sat down yet, pimp, standin' gorilla\nEven if I'mma all alone or standin' with four niggas\nTell'em jump, pimpin' it don't get no realer\n5'9\" with the soul of a 6'4\" nigga\nI separated the fakes, paralized from the waist down\nFrom the real stand up guys of the A-Town\nCan't even look me in my eyes, put yo face down\nI'm outta jail nigga, whachu gotta say now?\n\n[Hook]\nMotivation\nNiggas fakin' only gonna inspire (Motivation)\nAll yo hatin' in fuel to my fire (It's motivation)\nNiggas plottin' on the crown salt droppin' (It's motivation)\nHey but I ain't slowin' down and I ain't stoppin' (Motivation)\nNow nigga don't stop my show (Motivation)\nYou ain't know I don't stop, I go (It's motivation)\nSucka niggas can't make me suffer\nJust make me stronger and make me tougher (It's motivation)\n\n[Verse 2]\nTo be locked in a box niggas happy to see\nPut anybody on top, any rapper but T-I-P\nBut back to reality, G-O-D still carrying me, nigga I run this\nSpread yo rumours, kick all yo lil' dumb shit\nTell lies, laugh 'bout the time that I'm gon get\nIf it make you feel better, picture me over and done with\nPunk bitch, come with all the gossip you can come with\nSmall thang to a giant, I can overcome this\nJail, I don' done this, rap I'm just havin' fun with\nI could be a local joker, never have one hit\nNigga, \"New Finish\" alone'll get me dumb rich\nWhile these rappers sellin' records gettin' pennies\nIf Grand Hustle sell any, I'mma get plenty\nIf God with me, who could be against me sucka?\nCan't make me suffer, just make me tougher\n\n[Hook] - repeat\n\nRepeat [Hook]\n\n[Hook] - repeat"}}, {"title": "Live in the Sky", "album": "The Leak", "year":

This TIP, you know?\nI'd like to dedicate this song to anybody who done ever lost somebody\nTo the grave, to the streets, to the jail cell...\nI done been in situations where I done had to cope with all three, you know what I'm sayin?\nI feel the only thing I ain't done yet is die, you know?\nBut it ain't how I live while I'm here, it's how I live when I leave, ya dig?\n\n[Chorus: (Jamie Foxx) & T.I.]\n(Life's ups and downs, they come and go)\nBut when I die, I hope I live in the sky\nAll my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky\nPray to God when I die, that I live in the sky\n(It's true what goes around, comes back you know)\nSo when I die I hope I live in the sky\nAll my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky\nTell God, I wanna fly, and let me live in the sky\n\n[Verse 1: T.I.]\nMy cousin Toot ain't have to die right in front of his son\nAnd his wife, he lost his life struggling over a gun\nGive a damn what he done, that's my muhfuckin' folk\nAnd I love that nigga to death, no muhfuckin' joke\nI can feel my eyes fillin', the Lord is my witness\nIf I catch him, I'ma kill him, I made it my business\nBack in the day, you stayed in my business\nTaught me I ain't have to incorporate yay in my business\nCoincidentally, that's why today you not with me\nMy cousin died over some yay, and I miss him\nPlus he at his family house, let's say she the eyewitness\nBut her boyfriend did the shootin', judge gave a life sentence\nI heard that, now I'm dressed up in all black\nShot up the whole apartments, he still ain't brought back\nThe best friend I had in Tremell, I lost that\nGuess your death was a lesson in life, it taught me that\n\n[Chorus: (Jamie Foxx) & T.I.]\n(Life's ups and downs, they come and go)\nBut when I die, I hope I

live in the sky\nAll my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky\nTell God, I wanna fly, and let me live in the sky\n\n[Verse 2: T.I.]\nYou ever seen a nigga go to jail and sleep 'til day 2?\nWell, that's how sick I was when Jay-Ru\nFound out the hard way, that wasn't powder that they were tootin'\nOverdosed on heron, died at 22\nIf you ain't heard about your daughter, she smile just like you\nSo cute, even resorts to violence like you\nYou know your baby momma loose, but ha, what can you do?\nAnd I got four myself, yuh, it's been a few\nNow everything I do is for King, Messiah, Deyjah, Domani\nTell the Lord they all I've got, so please don't take them from me\nFrom me standin' in the trap, with carryin' this here cap\nLaughin' at the niggas who serve with no strap\nTell them niggas, man, y'all trippin' with no maps\nGet robbed and ask to borrow my pistol ain't gon' happ'\nMe, you, the crew just fell out over dough and a lil crack\nNever could apologize, you died, that's why they say that\n\n[Chorus: (Jamie Foxx) & T.I.]\n(Life's ups and downs, they come and go)\nBut when I die, I hope I live in the sky\nAll my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky\nPray to God when I die, that I live in the sky\n(It's true what goes around, comes back you know)\nSo when I die I hope I live in the sky\nAll my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky\nTell God, I wanna fly, and let me live in the sky\n\n[Verse 3: T.I.]\nI bet you niggas think I'm livin' it up\nTil you see polices laughin' as they pickin' me up\nWent from seeing how many bitches I could fit in the truck\nTo three hots and a cot, is you kiddin' or what?\nFuck how many millions I got, nigga, so what if I'm hot?\nWhen I got prices on my head, Feds rushin' my spot\nA million haters want me dead, forced to carry a gat\n\"But you's a seven-time felon, what you doin' with that?\"\nIt's a Catch-22, either you lose or you lose\nThat's the way the game structured, for real niggas to suffer\nAnd I ain't never been a buster, always stood on my feet\nLike a man prepared to take whatever coming for me\nA pussy nigga or polices with a warrant for me\nI'm a G, prepared to die for what's important to me\nLook anybody in the eye who say he want it wit' me\nPut up the house and bet the odds if it's comin' from me\nOG's say I need to learn to be patient\nYou telling me with these seven years of probation\nPistol charges and a host of other open cases\nIf niggas only knew the kind of time I was facin'\nI try to keep it to myself, but sometimes I couldn't take it\nGot four kids, the smiles on they faces\nMean more to me than my crown and my bracelet\nTake that away from me, and my life is butt naked\n\n[Chorus: (Jamie Foxx) & T.I.]\n(Life's ups and downs, they come and go)\nBut when I die, I hope I live in the sky\nAll my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky\nPray to God when I die, that I live in the sky\n(It's true what goes around, comes back you know)\nSo when I die I hope I live in the sky\nAll my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky\nTell God, I wanna fly, and let me live in the sky\n\n[Outro: T.I. & Jamie Foxx]\nHey man, I'd like to dedicate this song to my cousin Toot\nAlejandro Tremell Morgan, man\nI miss the shit out you, my nigga\nI'd also like to dedicate this to my homeboy Jay-Ru\nJamar Hendrix, what's happenin'?\nAlso my partner Bankhead, Man Lee Horton, what it is, nigga\nP$C for life, and death\nAnd my lil' homeboy Poncho, and my lil' homeboy Rico\nI shed tears writin' this song, homeboy\nThat's real talk man\nAy, I wanna live in the sky\nLet me live in the sky\nPray to God that I live in the sky\nI want to live in the sky\nI want to live in the sky\nI want to live in the sky\nWhy can't we

"[Intro: T.I.]\nWhat's happenin', man? This TIP, you know?\nI'd like to dedicate this song to anybody who done ever lost somebody\nTo the grave, to the streets, to the jail cell...\nI done been in situations where I done had to cope with all three, you know what I'm sayin?\nI feel the only thing I ain't done yet is die, you know?\nBut it ain't how I live while I'm here, it's how I live when I leave, ya dig?\n\n[Chorus: (Jamie Foxx) & T.I.]\n(Life's ups and downs, they come and go)\nBut when I die, I hope I live in the sky\nAll my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky\nPray to God when I die, that I live in the sky\n(It's true what goes around, comes back you know)\nSo when I die I hope I live in the sky\nAll my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky\nTell God, I wanna fly, and let me live in the sky\n\n[Verse 1: T.I.]\nMy cousin Toot ain't have to die right in front of his son\nAnd his wife, he lost his life struggling over a gun\nGive a damn what he done, that's my muhfuckin' folk\nAnd I love that nigga to death, no muhfuckin' joke\nI can feel my eyes fillin', the Lord is my witness\nIf I catch him, I'ma kill him, I made it my business\nBack in the day, you stayed in my business\nTaught me I ain't have to incorporate yay in my business\nCoincidentally, that's why today you not with me\nMy cousin died over some yay, and I miss him\nPlus he at his family house, let's say she the eyewitness\nBut her boyfriend did the shootin', judge gave a life sentence\nI heard that, now I'm dressed up in all black\nShot up the whole apartments, he still ain't brought back\nThe best friend I had in Tremell, I lost that\nGuess your death was a lesson in life, it taught me that\n\n[Chorus: (Jamie Foxx) & T.I.]\n(Life's ups and downs, they come and go)\nBut when I die, I hope I live in the sky\nAll my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky\nPray to God when I die, that I live in the sky\n(It's true what goes around, comes back you know)\nSo when I die I hope I live in the sky\nAll my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky\nTell God, I wanna fly, and let me live in the sky\n\n[Verse 2: T.I.]\nYou ever seen a nigga go to jail and sleep 'til day 2?\nWell, that's how sick I was when Jay-Ru\nFound out the hard way, that wasn't powder that they were tootin'\nOverdosed on heron, died at 22\nIf you ain't heard about your daughter, she smile just like you\nSo cute, even resorts to violence like you\nYou know your baby momma loose, but ha, what can you do?\nAnd I got four myself, yuh, it's been a few\nNow everything I do is for King, Messiah, Deyjah, Domani\nTell the Lord they all I've got, so please don't take them from me\nFrom me standin' in the trap, with carryin' this here cap\nLaughin' at the niggas who serve with no strap\nTell them niggas, man, y'all trippin' with no maps\nGet robbed and ask to borrow my pistol ain't gon' happ'\nMe, you, the crew just fell out over dough and a lil crack\nNever could apologize, you died, that's why they say that\n\n[Chorus: (Jamie Foxx) & T.I.]\n(Life's ups and downs, they come and go)\nBut when I die, I hope I live in the sky\nAll my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky\nPray to God when I die, that I live in the sky\n(It's true what goes around, comes back you know)\nSo when I die I hope I live in the sky\nAll my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky\nTell God, I wanna fly, and let me live in the sky\n\n[Verse 3: T.I.]\nI bet you niggas think I'm livin' it up\nTil you see polices laughin' as they pickin' me up\nWent from seeing how many bitches I could fit in the truck\nTo three hots and a cot, is you kiddin' or what?\nFuck how many millions I got, nigga, so what if I'm hot?\nWhen I got prices on my head, Feds rushin' my spot\nA million haters want me dead, forced to carry a gat\n\"But you's a seven-time felon, what you doin' with that?\"\nIt's a Catch-22, either you lose or you lose\nThat's the way the game structured, for real niggas to suffer\nAnd I ain't never been a buster, always stood on my feet\nLike a man prepared to take whatever coming for me\nA pussy nigga or polices with a warrant for me\nI'm a G, prepared to die for what's important to me\nLook anybody in the eye who say he want it wit' me\nPut up the house and bet the odds if it's comin' from me\nOG's say I need to learn to be patient\nYou telling me with these seven years of probation\nPistol charges and a host of other open cases\nIf niggas only knew the kind of time I was facin'\nI try to keep it to myself, but sometimes I couldn't take it\nGot four kids, the smiles on they faces\nMean more to me than my crown and my bracelet\nTake that away from me, and my life is butt naked\n\n[Chorus: (Jamie Foxx) & T.I.]\n(Life's ups and downs, they come and go)\nBut when I die, I hope I live in the sky\nAll my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky\nPray to God when I die, that I live in the sky\n(It's true what goes around, comes back you know)\nSo when I die I hope I live in the sky\nAll my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky\nTell God, I wanna fly, and let me live in the sky\n\n[Outro: T.I. & Jamie Foxx]\nHey man, I'd like to dedicate this song to my cousin Toot\nAlejandro Tremell Morgan, man\nI miss the shit out you, my nigga\nI'd also like to dedicate this to my homeboy Jay-Ru\nJamar Hendrix, what's happenin'?\nAlso my partner Bankhead, Man Lee Horton, what it is, nigga\nP$C for life, and death\nAnd my lil' homeboy Poncho, and my lil' homeboy Rico\nI shed tears writin' this song, homeboy\nThat's real talk man\nAy, I wanna live in the sky\nLet me live in the sky\nPray to God that I live in the sky\nI want to live in the sky\nI want to live in the sky\nI want to live in the sky\nWhy can't we live in the sky?\nThe sky"}}, {"title": "I'm Back", "album": "No Mercy", "year": "2010-03-08", "lyrics": "[Hook]\nI never let you down, I\u2019ma shine on sight\nKeep your mind on your grind and off

don\u2019t do it like me\nLike a G I hold it down for the town I\u2019m at\nIn a flash like that\nRecognize I'm back!\nStrike a match, catch a fire\n\n[Verse 1]\nAny moment I decide that's enough of all your lies\nBoy, your buzz just died\nStep inside, super-fly, to the shoes in their coupe\nThen exit out with all the bitches like we always do\nMy desire to retire grow with every new crew\nCause these guys, they don't ride like my nigga, you too\nTight jeans, funny haircuts dancing on the screen\nThere's a drought of real niggas in the game, so it seems\nJust pretend to holla, pimping, give the shit a black eye eye\nNext he say he trapping in my head I\u2019m like: \"why?\"\nBe yourself; you ain't got a pimp bone in your body\nI can tell you ain't never bought a key or caught a body\nNigga probably just seen Wayne, Gucci Mane\nMe and Boosie all go to prison\nNow he flipping hoes, every nigga tripping\nListen dude, for you that ain't in the cards\nThank the power's in the guns\nBut overall it's in your heart\nNowadays I don\u2019t know what's up with niggas in the A\nGuess he think he in the game but he really in the way:\nViolating. I was having conversations in the joint\nBut guess who done it? And I promised I would put you on point\nI\u2019m disappointed in you, dogg, you ain't hold it down at all\nBut I ain't going at your jaw, just going to show you how to ball\nStanding tall through the storm, on the yard or in the dorms\nCats in prison who expecting me to represent for them\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nStrike a match, catch a fire, see T.I. add gas\nWhat's a Molotov cocktail that never break a glass\nStill I am, partnas want to come for me you better bring it\nI ain\u2019t mad I forgive them, God I know they ain't mean it\nYeah I seen it all before, hate I'm popping and they ain't\nWrack they brain try to think how to stop it and they can\u2019t\nAin't that lame, but then that hatred manifest to pure malice\nI\u2019m no longer being callous, I\u2019m gonna let you niggas have it\nWon\u2019t be satisfied until somebody dies and I'm patiently waiting on\nMe and the reaper on a first name basis now\nI\u2019m a let you make it now, stay totally out the way for you\nBut know that we could take it any place you wanna take it too\nHating in your blood, Cuz. Yes, it\u2019s just too late for you\nAll I could do is pray for you or organize a wake for you\nYour choice, clearly I ain't hearing your voice\nKeep it up an Imma send you ass to chill wit Aunt

squares I float\nQuarter-million dollar cars everywhere I go\nI know in the lead it may seem he might be\nBut no matter what they doing, they don\u2019t do it like me\nLike a G I hold it down for the town I\u2019m at\nIn a flash like that\nRecognize I'm back!\nStrike a match, catch a fire\n\n[Verse 1]\nAny moment I decide that's enough of all your lies\nBoy, your buzz just died\nStep inside, super-fly, to the shoes in their coupe\nThen exit out with all the bitches like we always do\nMy desire to retire grow with every new crew\nCause these guys, they don't ride like my nigga, you too\nTight jeans, funny haircuts dancing on the screen\nThere's a drought of real niggas in the game, so it seems\nJust pretend to holla, pimping, give the shit a black eye eye\nNext he say he trapping in my head I\u2019m like: \"why?\"\nBe yourself; you ain't got a pimp bone in your body\nI can tell you ain't never bought a key or caught a body\nNigga probably just seen Wayne, Gucci Mane\nMe and Boosie all go to prison\nNow he flipping hoes, every nigga tripping\nListen dude, for you that ain't in the cards\nThank the power's in the guns\nBut overall it's in your heart\nNowadays I don\u2019t know what's up with niggas in the A\nGuess he think he in the game but he really in the way:\nViolating. I was having conversations in the joint\nBut guess who done it? And I promised I would put you on point\nI\u2019m disappointed in you, dogg, you ain't hold it down at all\nBut I ain't going at your jaw, just going to show you how to ball\nStanding tall through the storm, on the yard or in the dorms\nCats in prison who expecting me to represent for them\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nStrike a match, catch a fire, see T.I. add gas\nWhat's a Molotov cocktail that never break a glass\nStill I am, partnas want to come for me you better bring it\nI ain\u2019t mad I forgive them, God I know they ain't mean it\nYeah I seen it all before, hate I'm popping and they ain't\nWrack they brain try to think how to stop it and they can\u2019t\nAin't that lame, but then that hatred manifest to pure malice\nI\u2019m no longer being callous, I\u2019m gonna let you niggas have it\nWon\u2019t be satisfied until somebody dies and I'm patiently waiting on\nMe and the reaper on a first name basis now\nI\u2019m a let you make it now, stay totally out the way for you\nBut know that we could take it any place you wanna take it too\nHating in your blood, Cuz. Yes, it\u2019s just too late for you\nAll I could do is pray for you or organize a wake for you\nYour choice, clearly I ain't hearing your voice\nKeep it up an Imma send you ass to chill wit Aunt Joyce\nHey, you can have the bottom, partner I'm up in the sky box\nI got shit locked down nigga why stop now\nI'm so above you, hover over suckers why drop down\nI\u2019m so profound, it goes down, and I never let you down"}}, {"title": "King", "album": "Paperwork: The Motion Picture", "year": "2014-10-21", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nYou know, may no man, woman, child, nor animal\nWalk a lifetime on God green Earth and not expect to be tested\nJust observe and acknowledge when the occasion is risen to by champions\nYou know what I'm sayin'?\nLet this speak for itself and handle me accordingly\nWhen you see me nigga, it ain't no secret, you know what's happenin'\nNo fake, no flaw, man.

We'll never know\nI'm late for my date with destiny\nLet me go\n\n[Verse 2 : T.I.]\nEverybody's standing and waitin\nChanting, they' hating\nGospels say they should forgive me\nThey'd rather hand me to Satan\nBlatant, displays the day of hypocrisy\nBoy you got to be kidding\nCould it be possibly the second coming of Pac is me?\nRemember that, when he was here?\nAnd when he died you realized you need him here\nGod with me partner, ain't no one for me to fear\nHindsight: 20/20\nFuture not as clear\nBut I'm a rider 'till I die\nPut bullets 'tween my eye\nI just ask that I can make my peace with God and say goodbye\nFuck up the world like Lady Di\nOn the day he died, his wife and sons and daughters know that every day he tried\nTo be a better person, nah, they wanted better verses\nThey could market to the merchants\nBut when they' closed curtains\nYou could be for certain ain't nobody perfect\nBut when you're rich, nobody gives a shit\nNo mercy\n\n[Chorus: The Dream]\nThere's no mercy for me\nNo crying myself to sleep\nNo mercy for me\nNightmares have become my dreams\nNo mercy for me\nGood morning reality\nWill I wake?

tell a bitch again?\nThe bullshit I'm addressin', check, I'm on some next level shit\nNever been fucked in the game; I'm celibate\nRarely out my element, barely out the ghetto, with\nOne foot out and one foot in, intelligent as fellas get\nListen, let's settle this: be clear, I could fall back\nSeven years, still it ain't no one ahead of me\nConsider it a blessin' if you get to stand next to me\nFive-star general, OG veteran\nCaked like Entenmann's, blowin' that celery\nStack that cash like the U.S. Treasury\nEvery single thing I ever did was done heavily\nRap until you're 70, still ain't no catchin' me\nPut it on my pops, Big Phil, Aunt Beverly\nBe standin' on the top still after they bury me\nNose in the air, so stuck up, arrogant\nAin't got long hot songs, best cherish it\nCool, when I drop mine; that's over, finito\nYou payin' for your foul like a free throw: BAOW!\nNow, how could a nigga think that he could see me\nOther than the magazine covers or the TV?\nKnow I sold more mixtapes than your CD\nYou're waitin' on your big break, prayin' you could be me\nYou ain't made it far as D.C., on the low\nI been all around the globe, like a God how they treat me\nBroads hit they knees, eyes closed when they greet me\nMouth wide open, just beggin' me to skeet-skeet\nYou in a deep sleep, stop dreamin'\nI'm six albums in, for ten years, I been firing hot semen\nThe limelight's mine, I'm gleamin', beamin'\nAsk why I say I'm King, bitch, I got my reasons\n\n[Hook]\nWrist so frosty, neck so chilly (bing!)\nAll on my mind is to get more millies (what?)\nNiggas talk shit, that's silly (HA!)\nShawty, he ain't about that really? (nah) Is he?\nNigga, I'm illy! Haha, haha, haha, hey\nAye, I run this city, clearly (BANKHEAD!)\nTell 'em get lost, I'm busy, really? Nigga, I'm illy\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhere niggas get off? Piss off!\nMe and mine ought to take time to pop a lid off\nShit, all over the whereabouts of me, is y'all\nSick in your fuckin' mind? You figuring I'ma fizzle\nNever cooled off, Tip scorchin'\nMinimal injury, though they wishing me maximum misfortune\nNumber one, hands down, flows paint portraits\nEverybody thinks you stink like horse shit\nHouse full of chicks on some Girl Next Door shit\nA king of oneself,  30 mil' out the store quick\nOf course, this case, lost all my endorsements\nTripled up on real estate, still buyin' more shit\nBut Tip bankrupt, according to your sources\nI'm still caked up along with more reinforcements\nTore shit up from the lobby to the rooftops\nOfficially: the hottest nigga rappin' since 2Pac\n'Fore you rap 'bout me, best ask 'bout me\nI'm out my fuckin' mind, need counselin'\nPlease don't doubt me, trust me, drama ain't nothin'\nIt's all fun and games 'til somebody start bustin'\n'Member my discussion when rappers be battlin'\nI find out about it, better get to skedaddlin'\nPack your family bags, move 'em out to Seattle and\nWe ever cross paths, you'll need ambulance and bandages\nLive life glamorous, so extravagant\nMandarin Oriental, worldwide travellin'\nHip-hop champion, for real though\nYou couldn't fuck with me with a Brazil ho, nigga, but still though\n\n[Hook]\nWrist so frosty, neck so chilly (bing!)\nAll on my mind is to get more millies (what?)\nNiggas talk shit, that's silly (HA!)\nShawty, he ain't about that really?

knock off\nViolation, that'll get ya ass knocked off\nTexas Pete nigga get ya ass hot sauce\nEver see me in the club with my shades off\nIt was a cool contest I guess the shades lost\n28-5 yeah that's my cost\nBitch my closet so big I swear I got lost\nWhat? Yeah I think I'm gon' need a map\nWe throw them birdies in the pool make 'em swim a lap\nWhip it counterclockwise, that's the backstroke\nBitch my chain so big look like my back broke\nYeah we 'bout

rocking\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: T.I. & Young Jeezy]\n\n[T.I.]\nI'm talkin' A-Town shit, ex lean pound bit\nChopper, fifty round clip\nKeep it with me, I 'on't slip\nAnyone around Tip bout that drama

that ain't what you want you ain't one of us\nWe broadcast live\n\n[Verse 1]\nFrom a hellhole\nYou sell blow, better get enough to get an elbow\nOr you ain't shit\nYou be the man when you seen bricks\nAnd not before that\nIt ain't gon be no sucker shit, you better know that\nPrepare for the gunplay, you'll encounter it one day\nHappen that kept me with it and I'm back on the frontpage\nJust play this shit how it go, I follow the g-code\nThey so far up on niggas they think u got a cheatcode\nAll I ever wanted was a widebody Benz\nAnd a bad bitch, you ain't got no widebody friends\nAin't never got a little hand 'em out\nLong as I can keep the cheetah on me at the gambling house\n\n[Hook]\nOK we broadcast live from the west side\nWhere the real nigga ride and the rest die\nAyy don't be

father go do some time for they brother\nBoy you get caught with that bundle better not point at another\n'Fore you get hit with a title from which you never recover\nMy uncle mad tell me boy you better be the man\nYou better fight, they whoop your ass then you fight again (damn)\nComing live from the trap spot\nGet everything from a slab to a laptop (cocaine)\nDivide the have from the have-nots\nShould twelve get on your ass, give them nothing but gas\nExpecting nothing but the money, spend it fast as it coming\nIn God We Trust, for everyone else the cash all\n\n[Hook]\nOK we broadcast live from the west side\nWhere the real nigga ride and the rest die\nAyy don't be out here talking bout shit that you don't know about\nYou catch a lick and do your time, you don't

us\n\n[Verse 3]\nNigga we live and direct from the project\nWhere niggas ain't got shit to lose, they ain't got shit\nSo when they get a little cheque, think they hot shit\nA pyrex and nine out of ten apartment\nAnd hot shit half price, nigga hard shit\nAnd thot shit'll turn around every week, but it did so you keep\nIf the neck game ain't good if a lame nigga peep\nAyy we'll turn up through the week but on the weekend!\n\n[Hook]\nOK we broadcast live from the west side\nWhere the real nigga ride and the rest die\nAyy don't be out here talking bout shit that you don't know about\nYou catch a

A-Town, connect!\n(Know the city gon' feel this) Damn right!\nSay Toot, I know you see me\n('Cris!) What up, boy?\nI know both our pops lookin at us\nWayne Bridges, what up? Let's go!\n(Bbeingig Phil, we made this shit happen homie)\nHistory in the makin'! (Momma I did it!)\n\n[Hook: B.o.B.]\nI used to dream (I used to dream) ohh-whoa (ohh!)\nAbout the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)\nBut now I see (now I see) ohh-whoa! (ohh!)\nBecause I'm sittin on top of the world! (the whole world)\nAnd now I see (ay) see (ay) see (ay) see (ay)\nCause I'm sittin on top of the world! (ay, ay, ay, ay)\nAnd now I see (ay) see (ay) see (ay) see (ay)\nCause I'm sittin on top of the world! (ay, ay, yeah, yeah)\n\n[Verse 1: T.I.]\nMan, I remember, 'fore I say that, wait, let me issue this statement\nNo way should reflection be mistaken for glorification\nNow, I remember so vivid, me and my niggas was livin'\nSub-standard condition, still handling business\nStill laughin' and trippin', still having the bitches\nI'm rapping now, reminiscing, and goddamn it, we did it\nFrom trappin', standin' & pitchin' with rich we stand in the kitchen\nSplittin' it eight ways, flip it in eight days\nThought that wild and unruly was just the way to behave\nKept the weight and the yay', but most the paper we made\nIn all dimes, I ain't lyin, the pleasure was all mine\nHad big work to move, but we served the small time\nI always outshined the niggas with small minds\nWho woulda thought we'd be arguably the greatest of all time\n'Round here? we develop such a sound down here\nBeen duplicated often, still, can only be found here\nOnly listen to Gs, that other shit I don't hear\nShit, they so far in the rear, why would I even care?\nI'm too busy a player, steering niggas careers\nBeen talkin 'bout it for years, and now we finally here\n\n[Hook: B.o.B.]\nI used to dream (I used to dream) ohh-whoa (ohh!)\nAbout the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)\nBut now I see (now I see) ohh-whoa!

Jackson, like, \"Wassup, motherfucker?!\"\n\n[Hook: B.o.B.]\nI used to dream (I used to dream) ohh-whoa (ohh!)\nAbout the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)\nBut now I see (now I see) ohh-whoa!

is, \"What up\"\n\nWhat's haapnin'\nAll you haters, can get at me\nCause I hear ya, and am watching\nBut I'm still here, I ain't stoppin'\nSo what up\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhat it is bruh, What it do mane\nStill the man from Japan to the blue flame\nStill hit the door and make it rain with the loose change\nI bet that what he get a show, now that's a damn shame\nI guess that what he hatin' fo', boy you so damn lame\nYour click the same, a just a bunch of walkin' shit stains\nDisgrace the A, you give the city such a bad name\nYou're way back in my rear view mirror, I'm in the fast lane\nBut still I hear ya loud and clear on your lil' song\nGo on get your dissing on while the king gone\nYour self-esteem gone, cause I'm back now\nLet's see if we can teach these niggas how to act now\nYou're kissing ass then, you jumping bad now\nI check your ass then, I shut your ass down\nAnd I deliver front and center never back down\nWho get the last laugh now sucka nigga\n\n[Hook]\nAy, what's Haapnin'\nAll you haters, can get at me\nCause I hear ya, and I'm watching\nBut I'm serious\nHaters, so all I got to say is, \"What up\"\n\nWhat's haapnin'\nAll you haters, can get at me\nCause I hear ya, and am watching\nBut I'm still here, I ain't stoppin'\nSo what up\n\n[Verse 2]\nI got a front street swag and a side street hustle\nCenter Hill, Cedar Ave. that's where I be sucka\nSouth Grand Church Street, the first with the work\nBut we can get into commercial, if you need some, chirp me\nHey, what I care 'bout who you asking saying they ain't heard of me\nI'm certified certainly your videos ain't hurting me\nI still ride with the windows rolled down\nAll around the A-town\nLike it's finna go down\nIf there was ever any questions niggas finna know now\nWon't retire my throne, nor surrender no crown\nI never bow down, and never say \"bye\"\nMs. \"To whom it may concern\" and whosoever may try\nI'm forever west-side and the feather-weight guy\nTell 'em take they best shot\nGo'on, get yourself high\nCause I yelled \"Bankhead\" and you felt left out\nI ain't mentioned your name, is that what all this 'bout?\n\n[Hook]\nAy, what's Haapnin'\nAll you haters, can get at me\nCause I hear ya, and I'm watching\nBut I'm serious\nHaters, so all I got to say is, \"What up\"\n\nWhat's haapnin'\nAll you haters, can get at me\nCause I hear ya, and am watching\nBut I'm still here, I ain't stoppin'\nSo what up\n\n[Verse 3]\nFrom Summer Hill to the hills up in Hollywood\nA house full, getting to it, you know how we do it\nYea we smoke great, and we drink good\nThen we ball hard, just like G's should\nBuy what we want, drive what we want\nG4 up up and away, we go, we fly where we want\nHaters smile like they like it when they really don't\nWish they could just wish me away that what they really want\n\"I really hate his ass\", \"I don't like him either\"\n\"We'll do a song together maybe then we can beat him\"\nSomehow he must be stopped, something must be done\n\"If we can't knock him off, let's just try him when he get caught with guns\"\n\"And if he really done, and we really won\"\n\"Any more ideas, (I got some) suggestions anyone?\"\n\"How 'bout we stay up all night, on the blog sites\"\n\"Spread, vicious lies and nasty rumors we could all write\"\nBut that's all right, let the nerds hate\nCause in my face though, them words getin' ate\nAnd hatin's hard work, when I just bounce back\nThis God work, tell all the haters I'm back!\n\n[Hook]\nAy, what's Haapnin'\nAll you haters, can get at me\nCause I hear ya, and I'm watching\nBut I'm serious\nHaters, so all I got to say is, \"What up\"\n\nWhat's haapnin'\nAll you haters, can get at me\nCause I hear ya, and am watching\nBut I'm still here, I ain't stoppin'\nSo what up"}}, {"title":

but I'mma die for mine\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "Top Back", "album": "King", "year": "2006-03-28", "lyrics": "[Produced by Mannie Fresh]\n\n[Intro]\nCr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me, homie, top shelf you know\nI like my beat down low, down low, down low, down low\nDown low, down low, down low, I like my top let back\nLet back, let back, let back let back, let back\n\n[Hook x2]\nI like my beat down low and my top let back\nCan see me ridin 24's with a chopper in the back\nYou like your Kenwood hot and your top let back\nIf your rims sit high and your windows pitch black\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm the man in my city ain't nobody fucking wit me\nYou can ask the real niggas and all the bad bitches\nI'm a known drug dealer I always have 50's\nAnd the thugs and the killers was all in class wit me\nSS'S on 26's watching some television\nShorty I'm never slipping got the Beretta in vision\nAnd ready to pop the clip in, ready to get to tripping\nReady to show these folks a celebrity pistol whipping\nPimp stole the automobile and the roof for the tag missing\nPolices' try to pursue me it's nothing but gas given\nAddicted to fast living, guess I'm one of my dad's children\nThink I'm bad now, you should've seen me before I had children\nGive dick to your daddy's daughter and dare her to have children\nHope he got some insurance cause death her ass is enduring\nKill her in Mississippi and drive her ass to Missouri\nStill my wet paint drippin' while I'm woodgrain gripping\n\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Verse 2]\nI got this Pimp Squad Click, I know you heard about us\nYoung niggas filthy rich and we ain't worried about much\nOn this Glock I clutch, In God I trust\nIf a fuck nigga start, bet his heart I bust\nGot your partners and the broad in your car fucked up\nWhat, you're under estimation thought a star wouldn't bust\nI got the heart and the guts on this purp I blow\nMove 10 bricks daily trying to twerk 5 mo'\nYa see the Cadillac swerving down Hollywood Road\nOn the fliest Spur in Cali fucking Hollywood Ho's\nOn a pill and half with my partner Young Dro\nBumping Goodie Mob Soul Food number fo'\nOther rappers' old news, told dudes I'ma pro\nWith a loaded fo' fo' and a quarter brick of blow\n(Hey) nigga don't you hit me less you buying 6 or mo\nMy 24 blades glistening and my 808 kicking\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI wear the crown down under man somebody better tell 'em\n'For I spit a hundred rounds and have everybody bailing\nI got some bitches in a Benz and my partners in the Chevy\nAnd now we riding Giovanni's and Asani's on Pirellis\nIf you ever think of trying to run up on me just forget it\nThe clip in the chopper long as ya leg and leave ya shredded\nPistol way in the truck got my knife on tuck\nYou think he ain't getting stuck, you got life fucked up\nA couple stitches in ya hip will have your night fucked up\nWill he live? Will he die? Guess he might luck up\nMeanwhile, I'm racing my Ferrari like a light for a buck\nAgainst Lamborghini Gallardos every time I get a car\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c907455bd8f88666725dd91da4736641.400x400x1.jpg", "artist": "T.I.", "raw": {"annotation_count": 11, "api_path": "/songs/381515", "apple_music_id": "1258976275", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/381515/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "?"}, "embed_content": "<div id='rg_embed_link_381515' class='rg_embed_link' data-song-id='381515'>Read <a href='https://genius.com/Ti-top-back-lyrics'>\u201cTop Back\u201d by T.I.</a> on Genius</div> <script crossorigin src='//genius.com/songs/381515/embed.js'></script>", "featured_video": false, "full_title": "Top Back by\u00a0T.I.", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/c907455bd8f88666725dd91da4736641.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c907455bd8f88666725dd91da4736641.400x400x1.jpg", "id": 381515, "lyrics_owner_id": 8534, "lyrics_state": "complete", "path": "/Ti-top-back-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 2, "recording_location": "P.S.

like my top let back\nLet back, let back, let back let back, let back\n\n[Hook x2]\nI like my beat down low and my top let back\nCan see me ridin 24's with a chopper in the back\nYou like your Kenwood hot and your top let back\nIf your rims sit high and your windows pitch black\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm the man in my city ain't nobody fucking wit me\nYou can ask the real niggas and all the bad bitches\nI'm a known drug dealer I always have 50's\nAnd the thugs and the killers was all in class wit me\nSS'S on 26's watching some television\nShorty I'm never slipping got the Beretta in vision\nAnd ready to pop the clip in, ready to get to tripping\nReady to show these folks a celebrity pistol whipping\nPimp stole the automobile and the roof for the tag missing\nPolices' try to pursue me it's nothing but gas given\nAddicted to fast living, guess I'm one of my dad's children\nThink I'm bad now, you should've seen me before I had children\nGive dick to your daddy's daughter and dare her to have children\nHope he got some insurance cause death her ass is enduring\nKill her in Mississippi and drive her ass to Missouri\nStill my wet paint drippin' while I'm woodgrain gripping\n\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Verse 2]\nI got this Pimp Squad Click, I know you heard about us\nYoung niggas filthy rich and we ain't worried about much\nOn this Glock I clutch, In God I trust\nIf a fuck nigga start, bet his heart I bust\nGot your partners and the broad in your car fucked up\nWhat, you're under estimation thought a star wouldn't bust\nI got the heart and the guts on this purp I blow\nMove 10 bricks daily trying to twerk 5 mo'\nYa see the Cadillac swerving down Hollywood Road\nOn the fliest Spur in Cali fucking Hollywood Ho's\nOn a pill and half with my partner Young Dro\nBumping Goodie Mob Soul Food number fo'\nOther rappers' old news, told dudes I'ma pro\nWith a loaded fo' fo' and a quarter brick of blow\n(Hey) nigga don't you hit me less you buying 6 or mo\nMy 24 blades glistening and my 808 kicking\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI wear the crown down under man somebody better tell 'em\n'For I spit a hundred rounds and have everybody bailing\nI got some bitches in a Benz and my partners in the Chevy\nAnd now we riding Giovanni's and Asani's on Pirellis\nIf you ever think of trying to run up on me just forget it\nThe clip in the chopper long as ya leg and leave ya shredded\nPistol way in the truck got my knife on tuck\nYou think he ain't getting stuck, you got life fucked up\nA couple stitches in ya hip will have your night fucked up\nWill he live? Will he die? Guess he might luck up\nMeanwhile, I'm racing my Ferrari like a light for a buck\nAgainst Lamborghini Gallardos every time I get a car\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "Top Back (Remix)", "album": "King", "year": "2006-12-12", "lyrics": "[Intro: T.I. & Young Jeezy]\nCr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me, homie, top shelf you know\nI like my beat down low, down low, down low, down low\nDown low, down low, down low, I like my top let back\nLet back, let back, let back let back, let back\nChea, you already know what this shit is nigga, remix nigga\nMannie Fresh, T.I.P what up, nigga?

is re-written, preacher be bullshiting\nSo when they speak believe not a thing\n\nBelieve M-L-King had a dream for real\nHe in Heaven, and we be dealing with demons still\nLike an episode of Pinky and the brain for real\nWanna run the world & rule errthing for real\n\nWell god damn (Hol' Up Hol' Up)\n\nWhatchu think will happen when you die ma man,(Die ma man)\nEven better whatchu gon do when they push you in the fire ma man\n\nWell I'm a sinner (true) but not like you\nI ain't been malicious in the shit I do\nWell, I might smoke a  blunt or two (ugh)\nM\u00e9nage every month or two\nSell I dope to get some money, shit I wanna do law\nBut I can't go to school, I ain't go the money to\nRather give me fifty years than a scholarship\nAnything to keep me outta politics\nI believe politicians pull a lot of tricks\nThe war on drugs crack epidemic, all a 'dat\nThe death of Bob Marley & Malcom X\nPac and Biggie too , but I ain't really sure about dat\n\nBelieve Jesus, die for my sins, don't need no fake image for me to hide behind man\nThe KKK and the USA got a thang like Superman got for Lois Lane\n\nUncle Sam lift a lady just address Us\nGrabbing on the pussy yelling \"shawty that thang\"\n\nNow be clear, I ain't tryna this ain't no black thang or white thang\nIt's a dead wrong and right thang\n\nBelieve white supremacy , think i'ont see it\nEverything they tryna bring down on me\nLike the stop and frisk, mass incarceration that perpetuation of recidivism\nThat mean they create a system hard to break\nThat's why millions still behind bars today\nColumbus day you believe a holiday\nWhat about Capone and Doc Holiday\nLucky Luciano, John Gotti day\nBumpy Johnson and Larry Hoover day\nHappy Meech day, Happy Tookie day\nHappy Hitler day, sounds stupid aye?\nThat\u2019s cause hypocrisy more American than democracy\nFar as I can see the Constitution wasn't for folk that look like me and that\u2019s what I believe!\n\n[Chorus ?? (T.I.) ]\nWanna be better but you down at the moment\nGive dat shit to God it'll  be better in the morning\nStill think your skin make you  way more important\nNaaaaahh (Hol' up)\nAll this money but you still can't afford me\nGotta sell your soul just to end up on the Forbes list\nLeader of the generation, I'ma get us all in\nAaaaahhh\n\n[Verse 2: T.I.]\nAll your plans ain't worth for damn\nCause in front of God, you are just a man\nWanna take advantage of a lesser man\nBuild a wall, keeping out the Mexicans\nGo to Standing Rock and wanna poison water, just like Michigan\nNow ain't this a bitch\nIf I learned anything, I've seen any bitch can be president (Hold up)\nI say that nigga hostile, get the yellow flare in they nostril (Hold up)\nGod never said weapons wouldn't form, he just said they wouldn't prosper\n\n[Outro: ?? (T.I)]\nStand for your people , ya\nStand with your brother, its time with your sister, ya\nStand for your people, ya\nWe can't give another fuck\nMessage to Americaaaaa\nSo Disappointing, we all disappointed\nBout to do some more play, Oh u want that OA?\nHow you doing numbers very similar to my case\nNeighborhood like a battlefield , we are not safe\n(I believe we are not safe, I believe we are not safe)\n(I belive dat what I believe dat what I believe we are not safe)\n(I believe we are not safe)\n(I believe dat what I believe we are not safe, dat what i believe, dat what i believe, eyy)"}}, {"title": "Touchdown", "album": "T.I. vs T.I.P.", "year": "2007-07-03", "lyrics": "[Hook: Eminem + (T.I.)]\nWhen we touch down, (in the Midwest we okay\nE'rybody know them southern boys love that bass)\nAtlanta go bananas, Alabama, 'weesiana\nMississippi, Ten-a-keys, every muh'fuckin' state\nWhen we touch down\n(Go right from the plane to the Range)\nWhen we touch down\n(On a private plane, gettin' brains, 'til we)\nTouch down, there ain't no way to keep 'em quiet\nWith T.I. and Shady, baby\nWe 'bout to incite a riot when we touch down\n\n[Verse 1: T.I.]\nWhen we get in town, you know how we gettin' down\nPull up clean, then we hop on out\nSnatch all the freaks, then walk on out\nI'm livin' what they talking 'bout, shinin' if it dark or not\nThat one hundred E-X-double R\nYou'll find that in the parkin' lot\nYou barkin' up the wrong tree, I do this shit for zone three\nFour, five and six as well as one, Atlanta I'm forever, son\nStill be on whatever coke, ridin' blowin' heavy smoke\nAye, Em, you better tell them folk, won't hesitate to let 'em go\nThey know I put that green light on them haters\nKeep on tryin' me, I put that beam right on your tater (pow!)\nNow you don't wanna see T.I.P. outrageous\nTry to keep him in a cage, but somehow he keep escapin'\nThat's why I be on vacation, Virgin Island I be takin'\nPrivate planes out to Spain, I keep on flyin', I ain't fakin'\nThe money ain't a thang, think I'm lyin', you're mistaken\nYou can find long lines of all kinds of bitches waitin'\n\n[Hook: T.I. + (Eminem)]\nWhen we touch down, in the Midwest we okay\nE'rybody know them southern boys love that bass\n(Atlanta go bananas, Alabama, 'weesiana\nMississippi, Ten-a-keys, every muh'fuckin' state\nWhen we touch down)\nGo right from the plane to the Range\n(When we touch down)\nOn a private plane, gettin' brains, 'til we\n(Touch down, there ain't no way to keep 'em quiet\nWith T.I. and Shady, baby\nWe 'bout to incite a riot when we touch down)\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nWelcome to the Midwest, yes, where them Detroit playas ball\nLike you have no idea, the boy is here\nGot the whole place looking like it's candy painted\nAin't it like we left the kids at home\nAnd just let 'em loose with the crayons?\nFuck, I just hit a jogger, people lookin' like Frogger\nThey hoppin' out of the way\nWhenever they see Marshall's car comin'\nThe kids painted my windows with black permanent marker\nAnd let the rest of the car carpet color like swirl pops\nAnd I got the bass thumpin'\nBut I'm bound to bump into somethin'\nKids are flyin' through the air lookin' like they krumpin'\nThe way they tumblin', I gotta do somethin'\nBut as soon as I hit the car wash to get the tar off\nThey just right back at it tomorrow\nThey're like, \"Dad, this is in, so you're with the trends.\"\n\"This is for the pimps\nListening to Mims, nail polish on the rims.\"\nAnd now it's custom chrome, but I gotta go do a show\nSo go on with your bad self, just have it back to normal\n\n[Hook: Eminem + (T.I.)]\nWhen I touch down, (in the Midwest we okay\nE'rybody know them southern boys love that bass)\nAtlanta go bananas, Alabama, 'weesiana\nMississippi, Ten-a-keys, every muh'fuckin' state\nWhen we touch down\n(Go right from the plane to the Range)\nWhen we touch down\n(On a private plane, gettin' brains, 'til we)\nTouch down, there ain't no way to keep 'em quiet\nWith T.I. and Shady, baby\nWe 'bout to incite a riot when we touch down\n\n[Verse 3: T.I.]\nFrom my arrival, until my departure\nGuarantee I put this d-i-c-k in somebody daughter\nAye, I still have my way with the ladies way cross the water\nFlew to Paris from Haiti, did some shit that I thought of\nIt's ironic that the shit that we poppin' makes us psychotic\nThen treaten corporate America\nThat's why they runnin' from me\nHow could they be so ignorant?\nLook what hip-hop done brung us!\nIt's allowed us to run a business, legitimated our moneys\nGot us out of the ghettos and relocated our mommies\nI made it all the way here, ain't no way you takin' it from me\nSo excuse me, Oprah, honey, I'm sorry, really I promise\nBut niggas, bitches and hoes do exist, I'm just bein' honest\nFor that am I being punished?

them southern boys love that bass)\nAtlanta go bananas, Alabama, 'weesiana\nMississippi, Ten-a-keys, every muh'fuckin' state\nWhen we touch down\n(Go right from the plane to the Range)\nWhen we touch down\n(On a private plane, gettin' brains, 'til we)\nTouch down, there ain't no way to keep 'em quiet\nWith T.I. and Shady, baby\nWe 'bout to incite a riot when we touch down\n\n[Verse 1: T.I.]\nWhen we get in town, you know how we gettin' down\nPull up clean, then we hop on out\nSnatch all the freaks, then walk on out\nI'm livin' what they talking 'bout, shinin' if it dark or not\nThat one hundred E-X-double R\nYou'll find that in the parkin' lot\nYou barkin' up the wrong tree, I do this shit for zone three\nFour, five and six as well as one, Atlanta I'm forever, son\nStill be on whatever coke, ridin' blowin' heavy smoke\nAye, Em, you better tell them folk, won't hesitate to let 'em go\nThey know I put that green light on them haters\nKeep on tryin' me, I put that beam right on your tater (pow!)\nNow you don't wanna see T.I.P. outrageous\nTry to keep him in a cage, but somehow he keep escapin'\nThat's why I be on vacation, Virgin Island I be takin'\nPrivate planes out to Spain, I keep on flyin', I ain't fakin'\nThe money ain't a thang, think I'm lyin', you're mistaken\nYou can find long lines of all kinds of bitches waitin'\n\n[Hook: T.I. + (Eminem)]\nWhen we touch down, in the Midwest we okay\nE'rybody know them southern boys love that bass\n(Atlanta go bananas, Alabama, 'weesiana\nMississippi, Ten-a-keys, every muh'fuckin' state\nWhen we touch down)\nGo right

when we touch down)\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nWelcome to the Midwest, yes, where them Detroit playas ball\nLike you have no idea, the boy is here\nGot the whole place looking like it's candy painted\nAin't it like we left the kids at home\nAnd just let 'em loose with the crayons?\nFuck, I just hit a jogger, people lookin' like Frogger\nThey hoppin' out of the way\nWhenever they see Marshall's car comin'\nThe kids painted my windows with black permanent marker\nAnd let the rest of the car carpet color like swirl pops\nAnd I got the bass thumpin'\nBut I'm bound to bump into somethin'\nKids are flyin' through the air lookin' like they krumpin'\nThe way they tumblin', I gotta do somethin'\nBut as soon as I hit the car wash to get the tar off\nThey just right back at it tomorrow\nThey're like, \"Dad, this is in, so you're with the trends.\"\n\"This is for the pimps\nListening to Mims, nail polish on the rims.\"\nAnd now it's custom chrome, but I gotta go do a show\nSo go on with your bad self, just have it back to normal\n\n[Hook: Eminem + (T.I.)]\nWhen I touch down, (in the Midwest we okay\nE'rybody know them southern boys love that bass)\nAtlanta go

this d-i-c-k in somebody daughter\nAye, I still have my way with the ladies way cross the water\nFlew to Paris from Haiti, did some shit that I thought of\nIt's ironic that the shit that we poppin' makes us psychotic\nThen treaten corporate America\nThat's why they runnin' from me\nHow could they be so ignorant?\nLook what hip-hop done brung us!\nIt's allowed us to run a business, legitimated our moneys\nGot us out of the ghettos and relocated our mommies\nI made it all the way here, ain't no way you takin' it from me\nSo excuse me, Oprah, honey, I'm sorry, really I promise\nBut niggas, bitches and hoes do exist, I'm just bein' honest\nFor that am I being punished? Why is you so astonished?\nNow, I ain't got a degree, just intelligence in abundance\nSo you ain't gotta like me, I know billions of folks who love me\nYou can tell how they yellin' and screamin' and waiting for me\n\n[Hook: T.I. + (Eminem)]\nWhen we touch down, in the Midwest we okay\nE'rybody know them southern boys love that bass\n(Atlanta go bananas, Alabama, 'weesiana\nMississippi, Ten-a-keys, every muh'fuckin' state\nWhen we touch down)\nGo right from the plane to the Range\n(When we touch down)\nOn a private plane, gettin' brains, 'til we\n(Touch down, there ain't no way to keep 'em quiet\nWith T.I. and Shady, baby\nWe 'bout to incite a riot when we touch down)"}}, {"title": "Porn Star", "album": "Paper Trail", "year": "2008-09-29", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nAy, Ay, Ay, Ay\nDamn shawty, look at you\nI'm saying man, is it just me\nOr do you have too much ass in them jeans?\nCome here\n\n[Verse 1]\nAy, I been watching you awhile now\nAnd I just wanna find a way to make you smile now\nWhy you blushing?\nForget about them other guys now\nI know you ain't going try and tell me that you shy now\nI realize that your beauty could intimidate\nThem suckers you ain't got no business wit'em anyway\nWit such a pretty face, big booty, little waist line\nI wanna grind from behind to the baseline\nHave a great time, pour yourself a shot girl\nChase it with a lime, now you feeling like a hot girl\nI know you probably use to dealing with them wannabes\nBut honestly I gotta say I'm who they wanna be\nI promise all I wanna see is you up under me\nAnd we can disappear whenever, when you wanna leave?\nI can guarantee the ride of your life\nAny fantasies on your mind we can try'em tonight\n\n[Hook]\nWe're sittin here\n(I'm lookin at you like damn)\nWe're sippin on Patr\u00e3n, something's on my mind\n(You wanna leave wit me tonight?)\nIt's been Killing me all night long and I wonder\n(Listen shawty let me tell you what I'm thinkin bout)\nOh girl, I wonder\n(For real, shawty let me tell you what I'm thinkin bout)\nIt's the end of the night\nI thinkin your might, wanna leave the bar\nPark the car, turn into porn star\n\n[Verse 2]\nYes, I love to hear about your interest\nI gotta say your intellect got me impressed\nSee your panties through your dress like a silhouette\nPatr\u00e3n got me thinkin sex, is you feeling that?\nNo disrespect though, a simple yes/no\nHey let yourself let go, shawty let's go\nPull up to the crib, get you through the threshold\nKiss you from your pretty lips to your red toes\nTime tickin it's the end of the night\nAnd you can leave wit your friend if you like\nBut I'm saying though\nWe can ride out, back to my house\nI wanna see you satisfied inside out\nOnce I'm in you ain't gonna want me to slide out\nYou tell your girlfriends they gonna wanna try it out\nA little more of this will loosen you up\nWhat we can't do in the club, we can do in the truck\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nHey would ya, stay?\nCould ya play wit it with your tongue just a little?\nYou're such a sexy individual, physical and mental\nAnd if you sentimental\nShouldn't the rules bend a little\nLet me start at the top, stop in the middle\nUse a popsicle make shiver, giggle when it tickle\nI can talk to you dirty if you like that\nI finish once, hit a blunt, start right back\nI know you told me you a good girl\nBut shawty you a grown woman not a little girl\nYou can blame it on the Patr\u00e3n or the champagne\nBut sometimes being bad can be a good thing, ya now\n\n[Hook - Repeat 2x]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cfd0caa9a36fd23db9dec05ae1a43aed.953x953x1.jpg", "artist": "T.I.", "raw": {"annotation_count": 6, "api_path": "/songs/58844", "apple_music_id": "1260881184", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/58844/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "9th track of T.I. sixth album.

ass in them jeans?\nCome here\n\n[Verse 1]\nAy, I been watching you awhile now\nAnd I just wanna find a way to make you smile now\nWhy you blushing?\nForget about them other guys now\nI know you ain't going try and tell me that you shy now\nI realize that your beauty could intimidate\nThem suckers you ain't got no business wit'em anyway\nWit such a pretty face, big booty, little waist line\nI wanna grind from behind to the baseline\nHave a great time, pour yourself a shot girl\nChase it with a lime, now you feeling like a hot girl\nI know you probably use to dealing with them wannabes\nBut honestly I gotta say I'm who they wanna be\nI promise all I wanna see is you up under me\nAnd we can disappear whenever, when you wanna leave?\nI can guarantee the ride of your life\nAny fantasies on your mind we can try'em tonight\n\n[Hook]\nWe're sittin here\n(I'm lookin at you like damn)\nWe're sippin on Patr\u00e3n, something's on my mind\n(You wanna leave wit me tonight?)\nIt's been Killing me all night long and I wonder\n(Listen shawty let me tell you what I'm thinkin bout)\nOh girl, I wonder\n(For real, shawty let me tell you what I'm thinkin bout)\nIt's the end of the night\nI thinkin your might, wanna leave the bar\nPark the car, turn into porn star\n\n[Verse 2]\nYes, I love to hear about your interest\nI gotta say your intellect got me impressed\nSee your panties through your dress like a silhouette\nPatr\u00e3n got me thinkin sex, is you feeling that?\nNo disrespect though, a simple yes/no\nHey let yourself let go, shawty let's go\nPull up to the crib, get you through the threshold\nKiss you from your pretty lips to your red toes\nTime tickin it's the end of the night\nAnd you can leave wit your friend if you like\nBut I'm saying though\nWe can ride out, back to my house\nI wanna see you satisfied inside out\nOnce I'm in you ain't gonna want me to slide out\nYou tell your girlfriends they gonna wanna try it out\nA little more of this will loosen you up\nWhat we can't do in the club, we can do in the truck\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nHey would ya, stay?\nCould ya play wit it with your tongue just a little?\nYou're such a sexy individual, physical and mental\nAnd if you sentimental\nShouldn't the rules bend a little\nLet me start at the top, stop in the middle\nUse a popsicle make shiver, giggle when it tickle\nI can talk to you dirty if you like that\nI finish once, hit a blunt, start right back\nI know you told me you a good girl\nBut shawty you a grown woman not a little girl\nYou can blame it on the Patr\u00e3n or the champagne\nBut sometimes being bad can be a good thing, ya now\n\n[Hook - Repeat 2x]"}}, {"title": "The Introduction", "album": "Trouble Man: Heavy Is the Head", "year": "2012-12-18", "lyrics": "[Produced by K Tracks, Tommy \"TBHITS\" Brown, and Travis Sayles]\n\n[Intro]\nI come apart baby, but now I'm fine\nI'm checkin' trouble sugar, moving down the line\nI come apart baby, but that's ok cuz\nTrouble man, don't get in my way\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm just a hood nigga I ain't never had shit\nJust a bad attitude and a bad bitch\nDuffle bag full of tools and a half brick\n30, 40, 50 grand in the mattress\nLiving on the edge just a habit dawg\nI'm fucked up in the head I don't have it all\nBall like a dog push it to the limit\n'Bout my business tryna keep from letting pussy niggas in it\nMy priorities is follow, God first then the fam'\nThen the hustle, then the money, failure ain't in the plan\nSatan on my heel he don't want me to advance\nI tell him go to hell sucka catch me if you can\nShit I am who I am, fresh up out of apologies\nSometimes I ain't get in trouble, trouble got in me\nGuess it follows me but I stays on my hustle man\nStill the motherfuckin' man you can call me (Trouble Man)\n\n[Hook x2]\nTrouble man, always in trouble man\nGrand hustle man, I'm the motherfuckin' man\nTrouble Man, stays in some trouble man\nBank rolls, rubber band, you can call me (Trouble Man)\n\n[Verse 2]\nDrugs and rock 'n' roll, ho you know how I roll\nJust left the crossroads, my soul, unsold\nRefrigerated console, the curtains on my car door\nRaw ho, caviar, sushi and escargot\nEverywhere I go fresh to death and clean as a bar of soap\nGetting blowed like trumpets in the wind in Chicago\nGod knows I'm hot as El Diablo\nWrist rockier than Colorado walk road\nAlso my flows I'm taking back although\nMy art's so Leonardo Da Vinci, Picasso\nThe rain gone come down on your head like tarp holes\nI guess these other rappers that's cool as far as soft goes\nSorry Charlie party's over shawty shop closed\nKing home, bank roll on King Kong\nGot these suckas in my scope with the beam on\nPrayin' for my downfall you can dream on\nMake sure I'm back in the Maybach gettin my lean on\nTrouble ain't changed me, role model ain't me\nDon't be angry now if I'm on the same street\nMake a u-turn haven't you learned I'm, Trouble Man\n\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Verse 3]\nWeight on my shoulders, chose to squat with it\nReal niggas say I kick it the same way Pac did it\nTell all them sucka nigga what the bizz is\nUpset cuz they can't do they thang like he did here\nShit, another year another bid done\nNo chump change big bank millions\nYa, my money old but I'm still young\nThem nigga lookin' for some drama I'm a give 'em some\nNo more beef a pimp will say goodbye to red meat\nBut cross a nigga path and you're dead meat\nRemain on my gang time, after time\n'97 college basshead, 99 dime\n'98 have provisions on 285 flyin\nSkip where you meet KP and L.A Reid got signed\nCut to the present and the rap game mine\nSome things never change it remains I'm (Trouble Man)\n\n[Hook x2]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6c270013a37f81fa5c7f0606f8824d12.300x300x1.png", "artist": "T.I.", "raw":

Sayles]\n\n[Intro]\nI come apart baby, but now I'm fine\nI'm checkin' trouble sugar, moving down the line\nI come apart baby, but that's ok cuz\nTrouble man, don't get in my way\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm just a hood nigga I ain't never had shit\nJust a bad attitude and a bad bitch\nDuffle bag full of tools and a half brick\n30, 40, 50 grand in the mattress\nLiving on the edge just a habit dawg\nI'm fucked up in the head I don't have it all\nBall like a dog push it to the limit\n'Bout my business tryna keep from letting pussy niggas in it\nMy priorities is follow, God first then the fam'\nThen the hustle, then the money, failure ain't in the plan\nSatan on my heel he don't want me to advance\nI tell him go to hell sucka catch me if you can\nShit I am who I am, fresh up out of apologies\nSometimes I ain't get in trouble, trouble got in me\nGuess it follows me but I stays on my hustle man\nStill the motherfuckin' man you can call me (Trouble Man)\n\n[Hook x2]\nTrouble man, always in trouble man\nGrand hustle man, I'm the motherfuckin' man\nTrouble Man, stays in some trouble man\nBank rolls, rubber band, you can call me (Trouble Man)\n\n[Verse 2]\nDrugs and rock 'n' roll, ho you know how I roll\nJust left the crossroads, my soul, unsold\nRefrigerated console, the curtains on my car door\nRaw ho, caviar, sushi and escargot\nEverywhere I go fresh to death and clean as a bar of soap\nGetting blowed like trumpets in the wind in Chicago\nGod knows I'm hot as El Diablo\nWrist rockier than Colorado walk road\nAlso my flows I'm taking back although\nMy art's so Leonardo Da Vinci, Picasso\nThe rain gone come down on your head like tarp holes\nI guess these other rappers that's cool as far as soft goes\nSorry Charlie party's over shawty shop closed\nKing home, bank roll on King Kong\nGot these suckas in my scope with the beam on\nPrayin' for my downfall you can dream on\nMake sure I'm back in the Maybach gettin my lean on\nTrouble ain't changed me, role model ain't me\nDon't be angry now if I'm on the same street\nMake a u-turn haven't you learned I'm, Trouble Man\n\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Verse 3]\nWeight on my shoulders, chose to squat with it\nReal niggas say I kick it the same way Pac did it\nTell all them sucka nigga what the bizz is\nUpset cuz they can't do they thang like he did here\nShit, another year another bid done\nNo chump change big bank millions\nYa, my money old but I'm still young\nThem nigga lookin' for some drama I'm a give 'em some\nNo more beef a pimp will say goodbye to red meat\nBut cross a nigga path and you're dead meat\nRemain on my gang time, after time\n'97 college basshead, 99 dime\n'98 have provisions on 285 flyin\nSkip where you meet KP and L.A Reid got signed\nCut to the present and the rap game mine\nSome things never change it remains I'm (Trouble Man)\n\n[Hook x2]"}}, {"title": "Warzone", "album": "Us or Else: Letter to the System", "year": "2016-09-08", "lyrics": "[Chorus]\nCan't you see

I'll wait, I'll wait\nHeard it from buddy who took for the fall for Watergate\nThe war on drugs was just a war on us\nGive us all these guns, give us all this dust\nChange all them laws, lock all of us up\nWent from Freeway Ricky, on to BMF (free Meech)\nThen hip hop came, that's when we got rich\nCause white kids gravitated to it like all us did\nAnd that's when they got slick\nInvented the technology to take our shit\nDiluted all of the artistry\nPardon me, somebody tell me what happened to Alton\nSterling, killed Philando right in front of the girl\nAnd the world saw\nEverybody's reaction was, \"Hell naw\"\nThis modern day slavery, the prison publicly traded\nAnd the jig's up\nThe Constitution and Emancipation Proclamation's just a fuckin' piece of paper\n\n[Chorus]\nCan't you see we livin' in a war zone?\nGuess you don't notice when you livin' in it\nLike every weekend it's a man down\nAin't got no pity for the innocent so I'ma represent it\nDedicated, tell 'em,\"Hands up, can't breathe\nHands up, can't breathe\nHands up, can't breathe\"\nHands up, can't you see we livin' in a war zone?\n\n[Outro]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/16f7960118cd6a9d64d17f95c9c1f173.600x600x1.jpg", "artist": "T.I.", "raw": {"annotation_count": 18, "api_path": "/songs/2848541", "apple_music_id": "1187114570", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/2848541/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "From his upcoming EP Us or Else, T.I. releases a tracked titled, War Zone, which speaks on social injustice regarding police brutality, the morally corrupt actions of policemen continuously getting paid leave after killing Black lives such as Eric Garner, and Philando Castile.\n\nThroughout the video shows a conjectural depiction of the idea of if the racial roles Blacks and Whites were reversed.

to keep him handy\nAnd don't hand him to nobody, nobody except family\nAnd keep him cocked and loaded and don't expose him to no body\nUnless somebody, who want him in his body\nTo love and cherish and from this trigger to a barrel\nFrom the bottom of your heart\n'til death do you fuckin' part\nDo you understand to live, to lie by him\nIs to share your soul, Lord knows, you gone die by him\nI know you heard gun stories about John Wayne and Billy the Kid\nShit, all them motherfuckers dead\nAnd did you know that every other bitch from the Wild, Wild West\nEnd up dying from hollow points to

casket\nNigga this the murder campy\nNiggas is murder happy\n12 years old, I jumped off the pot\nI started selling rock right after I got shot\nI had to hold my weight down\nPussy nigga stand up or

niggas\nThey can't stand up for what they motherfuckin' said\nNaw, I ain't say that, he said that\nStand up if you got somethin' to say, my nigga\nStand up for what you said, my nigga\nTell them niggas bring it to the square, nigga\n\n[Chorus: T.I. & Lil Jon]\nStand up\nIf you don't like what I'm saying then buck\nSwing when you see me we can throw them hands sucker\nStand up\nIf you didn't notice nigga, I don't give a fuck\nIf I said it then I meant it and what fuck nigga\nStand up\nYou don't want to see the triggerman bust\nHit you and your mans up, make it hard for niggas to\nStand up\nTell your crew they don't want it with us dude\nAnd if them motherfuckers do, bust a motherfucking move\nStand up\n\n[Verse 1: T.I.]\nYou got a alligator mouth and a hummingbird ass\nYour mouth writing checks that your ass can't cash\n145 and I'm out of your weight class\nWant to survive, you better scramble like eggs and break fast\nCause I know how to handle your fake ass\nI'm a ride on you and hide you in yesterday's trash\nPull up in the Chevy's spraying rounds through the glass\nSee you laying face down in the grass and I'll laugh\nHa, cause that's the end of the saga\nThe end of my problems, nigga mash the Impala\nGo lay up with a model and watch the news tomorrow\nAnd that's the end checkmate, game over, I'll holler\nPimp, telling you partner, you don't know what you're doing\nOr recognize the trouble you getting in to and you're ruin\nAnd dig this man\nI spent my childhood in a wild hood\nAnd all that gangster shit you talking, yeah, it sound good\nBut make it understood\nYou gone have to show me, I'm a O.G\nYou want to overthrow me\n\n[Chorus: T.I. & Lil Jon]\nStand up\nIf you don't like what I'm saying then buck\nSwing when you see me we can throw them hands sucker\nStand up\nIf you didn't notice nigga, I don't give a fuck\nIf I said it then I meant it and what fuck nigga\nStand up\nYou don't want to see the triggerman bust\nHit you and your mans up, make it hard for niggas to\nStand up\nTell your crew they don't want it with us dude\nAnd if them motherfuckers do, bust a motherfucking move\nStand up\n\n[Verse 2: Trick Daddy]\nDearly beloved, we're gathered here today\nTo marry this young nigga in his own special thug way\nDo you promise to love and respect all of the real niggas\nAnd when a problem come, learn to deal with 'em\nDo you swear to turn this chopper\nOn any motherfucker in your path, or the bitch that's trying to stop ya\nOr do you promise to keep him handy\nAnd don't hand him to nobody, nobody except family\nAnd keep him cocked and loaded and don't expose him to no body\nUnless somebody, who want him in his body\nTo love and cherish and from this trigger to a barrel\nFrom the bottom of your heart\n'til death do you fuckin' part\nDo you understand to live, to lie by him\nIs to share your soul, Lord knows, you gone die by him\nI know you heard gun stories about John Wayne and Billy the Kid\nShit, all them motherfuckers dead\nAnd did you know that every other bitch from the Wild, Wild West\nEnd up dying from hollow points to they fuckin' chest\nCause they ain\u2019t never seen a Carbine, a Mini 14, or a Tommy Gun\nWith a hundred round fuckin' drum\n\n[Chorus: T.I. & Lil Jon]\nStand up\nIf you don't like what I'm saying then buck\nSwing when you see me we can throw them hands sucker\nStand up\nIf you didn't notice nigga, I don't give a fuck\nIf I said it then I meant it and what fuck nigga\nStand up\nYou don't want to see the triggerman bust\nHit you and your mans up, make it hard for niggas to\nStand up\nTell your crew they don't want it with us dude\nAnd if them motherfuckers do, bust a motherfucking move\nStand up\n\n[Verse 3: Lil' Wayne]\nShit, I'm talking about riding out tonight\nOnly way I die first, got to kill me in this verse\nWeezy F middle finger to life\nSo nothing seem critical in the hood I'm typical\nYet I'm feeling good and spiritual\nHealing hoods with this shit up out my kitchen\nI'm pitching that it's really good\nSmoking, drinking, I'm like a fish\nAnd I'll probably shit on ya bitch\nProbably piss on her lips and she probably give you a kiss\nNasty, Holly Grove classic\nPolly wood a nigga probably robbed the same bastard\nAsk him\nWe don't give a fuck about a casket\nNigga this the murder campy\nNiggas is murder happy\n12 years old, I jumped off the pot\nI started selling rock right after I got shot\nI had to hold my weight down\nPussy nigga stand up or lay down\n\n[Chorus: T.I. & Lil Jon]\nStand up\nIf you don't like what I'm saying then buck\nSwing when you see me we can throw them hands sucker\nStand up\nIf you didn't notice nigga, I don't give a fuck\nIf I said it then I meant it and what fuck nigga\nStand up\nYou don't want to see the triggerman bust\nHit you and your mans up, make it hard for niggas to\nStand up\nTell your crew they don't want it with us dude\nAnd if them motherfuckers do, bust a motherfucking

me you don't want me up in ya crib with a ski mask on duck tapin' ya kids\nYou can pray all you want but I don't forgive\nYa shoulda been doin' that before ya did whatcha did\nI ain't gotta spell it out pimp you know what it is\nI'll rest you case for ya real man you know what it is\nPlus I got a hundred goons with me, dressed in black\nFifty at the front door, fifty at the back\nHalf got K's,

thoughts in his lap\nAnd dump 50 more on him and tell him to hold that\nLights out, no hasta ma\u00f1ana, hasta la vista, sayonara\nY t\u00fa no tomorrow, no remorse and no sorrow\nAnd the next one a

wiz by, he'll probably feel a little breeze\nDrop to ya knees, see the big barrel of the chrome\nFifth triple grip handles in the squeeze\nI keep a couple of those for the niggas who talk shit\nWhen I go to Jacob and cop that ring\nIf you try to see me I'mma cock that thang\nAnd I'mma pop that thang, and the shots gon' sting (really?)\nThe nigga ride inside the truck with me (and) for the most part the nigga stuck with me\nAnd tell you somethin' if you really were smart and you knew\nBetter people probably tell ya don't fuck with me\nFront if want motherfucka you can catch it\nSmile on my face even though I got a ratchet\nPop off (police) pull me over believe I got a compartment if I gotta stash it\nMust I just remind y'all niggas when I come through\nKnow that I'mma find y'all niggas, take two (break through)\nBust so many shots gun powder probably blind y'all niggas now (Okay, okay let's go)\nSee you don't know really wanna feel that Mossberg blow (naw)\nClap up a nigga then I cap up a nigga\nWhen I finish it'll turn into an absurd show (listen)\nThen you better observe yo\nFeel the sizzle from the bullet of the Glock burn slow (ssss)\nShit'll probably twist you up just a little and have your body leanin' lookin' like a quarter past four\nStay down betta (lay down)\nCheckin' for a nigga, come and put your body in the dirt\nI don't play bitch, you really need to go the other way\nIf you ain't know I got it under my shirt\n\n[Hook: T.I.]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2f70d0ed3d87a3cc476cfb530ff86686.600x600x1.jpg", "artist": "T.I.", "raw": {"annotation_count": 22,

shirt\nBetta tell 'em I ain't playin'\nBecause it's all fun and games until somebody get hurt\nAin't a damn thang change\nI still keep that thang right up under my shirt\nRun up on him where he hang and BANG!\nCause it's all fun and games until somebody get hurt\nBoy you finna get hurt, murked, put him in the dirt\nBoy you betta catch me first\nBoy you finna get hurt, murked, put him in the dirt\nBoy you betta catch me first\nBoy you finna get hurt, murked, put him in the dirt\nBoy you betta catch me first\nBoy you finna get hurt, murked, put him in the dirt\nBoy you betta catch me first\n\n[Verse 1: T.I.]\nAlota pussy niggas talk like broads love runnin' they mouth\nThat is til I run in they house\nPut the gun in they mouth, tell 'em \"Nigga talk shit now\"\nYou'd think they know the gun go BOW!\nI ain't scared of the law\nNaw I'm about to go to war what it is nigga win lose or draw\nI'll never get caught murkin' y'all cuz it ain't what you do\nThe question is: Who saw?\nShawty I'm way too raw\nCatch me any day you want you could think I'm a play if you want\nBut the fact still remain if I got a AK and you don't\nWell then playa you gone\nDon't get me wrong there's some niggas wanna kill me too (Well where they at?)\nBut this ain't bout shit cause it's well known where I'm at\nThey could catch me in the booth right now if you really like that\nNaw nigga let they ho get him in the whole shit, the 44 spit they holla \"Oh shit!\"\nProtectin' her and you both hit\nYou betta check ya girl cause you be so sick\nIf the choppa leave you with no dick\nOr a plastic bag holdin' yo' shit\nLeave 6 in you, a couple more in ya bitch\nAnd I don't miss cause I'm focused nigga\n\n[Hook: T.I.]\n\n[Verse 2: Alfa Mega]\n(I got you Tip)\n(I'm finna ride homie)\nFuck niggas might talk loud, act real, but they don't really want this here\nPussy niggas betta act right, lay low, we know where ya family live\nTrust me you don't want me up in ya crib with a ski mask on duck tapin' ya kids\nYou can pray all you want but I don't forgive\nYa shoulda been doin' that before ya did whatcha did\nI ain't gotta spell it out pimp you know what it is\nI'll rest you case for ya real man you know what it is\nPlus I got a hundred goons with me, dressed in black\nFifty at the front door, fifty at the back\nHalf got K's, half got Macs\nBring 'em out, bring em out, show me where he at\nWe can do him right here, we could catch him in trap\nRun up on his 'lac put a hole in his hat\nWith his brain on the dash, and his thoughts in his lap\nAnd dump 50 more on him and tell him to hold that\nLights out, no hasta ma\u00f1ana, hasta la vista, sayonara\nY t\u00fa no tomorrow, no remorse and no sorrow\nAnd the next one a y'all niggas try me like that\nI swear to God man I'm really gon' snap\n\n[Hook: T.I.]\n\n[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]\nRight now I'mma give you somethin' that a make a nigga beg \"Please\"\nWhen a bullet wiz by, he'll probably feel a little breeze\nDrop to ya knees, see the big barrel of the chrome\nFifth triple grip handles in the squeeze\nI keep a couple of those for the niggas who talk shit\nWhen I go to Jacob and cop that ring\nIf you try to see me I'mma cock that thang\nAnd I'mma pop that thang, and the shots gon' sting (really?)\nThe nigga ride inside the truck with me (and) for the most part the nigga stuck with me\nAnd tell you somethin' if you really were smart and you knew\nBetter people probably tell ya don't fuck with me\nFront if want motherfucka you can catch it\nSmile on my face even though I got a ratchet\nPop off (police) pull me over believe I got a compartment if I gotta stash it\nMust I just remind y'all niggas when I come through\nKnow that I'mma find y'all niggas, take two (break through)\nBust so many shots gun powder probably blind y'all niggas now (Okay, okay let's go)\nSee you don't know really wanna feel that Mossberg blow (naw)\nClap up a nigga then I cap up a nigga\nWhen I finish it'll turn into an absurd show (listen)\nThen you better observe yo\nFeel the sizzle from the bullet of the Glock burn slow (ssss)\nShit'll probably twist you up just a little and have your body leanin' lookin' like a quarter past four\nStay down betta (lay down)\nCheckin' for a nigga, come and put your body in the dirt\nI don't play bitch, you really need to go the other way\nIf you ain't know I got it under my shirt\n\n[Hook: T.I.]"}}, {"title": "I'll Show You", "album": "Fuck Da City Up", "year": "2012-01-01", "lyrics": "[Verse 1: T.I.]\nK-I-N-G\nSolomon, Henry\nRidin' in the Bentley\nThey wanna send me,

road\nReal talk from the heart what I'm known for\nSkinny jeans, I don't do those\nI'm the starter sub-par oughta shoot for\nFully automatic chopper, you could shoot though\nNow I'm movin' five mil' when I shoot dough\nAudemar, Hublot\nOne point five on the two-do'\nOld hustle, new flow\nOld money, new ho\nSuckers prayin' I'ma chill, but I'm too cold\nLong as I'm around, fuck they need you for?\nRidin' in the Chevy totin' three bricks\nSince nobody wanna make G shit\n\n[Hook: Watch The Duck]\nThis is for the gangsters, for the pimps and hoes\nThis is for the dope boy trappers sellin' halves and hoes\n(Since nobody wanna make G shit)\nThey want G shit, give it to 'em, give it to 'em now\nThey want G shit, give it to 'em, I'm the one to give it to 'em\n\n[Verse 2: T.I.]\nIf you don't know me let me tell you somethin', shawty\nStill got them choppers, make you run from it\nCamouflage, dog tag\nGot 'em followin', when you see me better haul ass\nKeep it G at all costs, what you call that?\nCrack rock, hip hop, I done all that\nCertified trap nigga, sucker, fall back\nA broke nigga he may entertain all that\nAll left field, keep it true, nigga\nSave the flash in the dance for a new nigga\nKeep speakin' for the ones who ain't got a voice\nKill 'em dead only when they leave no other choice\nHow I see it, if you ain't down to die 'bout it\nDon't waste my time, slime, why the fuck we talking about it?\nStill ridin' in the Chevy totin' three bricks\nSince nobody wanna make G shit\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Jeezy]\nNow what the fuck is an ounce? We smokin' bout an LB\nWe don't even do the nine, sell it by the whole ki\nAnd I'ma take this shit to trial, they got nothin' on me\nThey be on the Champagne, bitch, I'm 'bout to OD\nI got a bag full of birds and motherfuckers gettin' bought\nBars on the trap doors got it looking like a vault\nUsed to hit the highway over twenty of them things\nYoung nigga hit the club with the twenty of them chains\nWhen Jay was beefin' with Nas, I was sellin' cocaine\nWhen Game was beefin' with 50, I was doin' the same thing\nI was at the hospital, nigga, Meechy got shot\nFuck you niggas talking 'bout?

what's a pussy popper, want a demonstration\nBut I ain't waitin' til the second date, I'm so impatient\nRelieve'em of they aggravation, take'em rollerskatin'\nOn them Dayton's, tell'em \"Baby, stick

the weekend\nAyy, yeehaw\nI can make any bitch leave her man, just for the weekend\nShe don't really know it's goin' down tonight (Down tonight)\nUp in the city goin' down tonight\nAll lights, our mission, they gone tonight\nShe like, \"Shit, it's goin' down tonight\"\nI'm in my P1, doors up, I'm goin' places\nShe know that I'm goin' places (Goin' places)\nSeein' different faces\nBlue hundreds, big faces\nTonight (tonight), yeehaw\n\n[Verse 1: T.I.]\nGot it crackin' out in California\nWhat I'm blowin' on strong, bottle of ammonia\n\"Keep your fuckin' phone on\" what I tell my bitch\nShe don't answer, my mentality is hit a dancer\nFuck it, shit\nI got no time for the fuck shit, I'm gettin' money or die\nGet the fuck on with distractions, I'm way too dope not to have it\nRather say \"bye\" and stay fly than stay apart and me die\nSome shit it just ain't no teachin', either you with it or not\nIf you gon' measure my bad more than you measure my good\nJust think it could've been worse, I could be dead in the hood\nInstead I'm out here with Swift, poppin' bottles and shit\nTell me how we gettin' it, it feels like the '90s again, damn\n\n[Chorus: Young Thug]\nAyy (It's goin' down)\nIt's goin' down every weekend, yeah\nMalibu, top gone, everything for the weekend\nYeehaw, ayy\nSummertime, bathin' suit, jump in the pool for the weekend\nAyy, yeehaw\nI can make any bitch leave her man, just for the weekend\nShe don't really know it's goin' down tonight (Down tonight)\nUp in the city goin' down tonight\nAll lights, our mission, they gone tonight\nShe like, \"Shit, it's

yeehaw\n\n[Verse 2: Young Thug]\nThat Bentley truck'll get your dick sucked\nI know you want that, but first you gotta run your chips up, ooh\nI let lil' mama slurp on dick until her hiccup (Slurp)\nTold her, \"Keep that Rollie on\" until her fuckin' wrist cut (Ay, keep that Rollie on)\nAyy, okie pokie, woah (Okie pokie)\nI think my gators got a scoliosis, woah\nMade it out the hood, ain't win no trophy, but I got gold\nThe obstacle is get this money up and, and go\nOr you gon' end up stuck 'round here, drinkin' beer\nListen to my music, I can put somethin' in your ear\nPussy nigga play I bop-brrrat-bop-bop their beard\nYour mama seen you get bop-brrrat-bop-bopped, then she teared\nI pulled up to the party and walked in like, ayy\nI don't want no problems, I just wanna say...\n\n[Chorus: Young Thug]\nIt's goin' down every weekend, yeah\nMalibu, top gone, everything for the weekend\nYeehaw, ayy\nSummertime, bathin' suit, jump in the pool for the weekend\nAyy,

we never seen a bad day (yeah, yeah, yeah)\nWhen you see a Sunday\nDressed like we fresh off the front page (Yeah, yeah, yeah)\nCatch us every weekend (Weekend)\nAnd we gon' do more ballin' than sleepin'\nWe gon' be stayin' up, drinking all night\nGotcha pourin' shots out the bottle, getting high with a model\nAin't no body die, we'll be alright\nNigga, fuck the drugs and the liquor, we get high on the lifestyle\nI said fuck the drugs and the liquor, we get high on the lifestyle\n\n[Outro: T.I.]\nThe Dime Trap\nPlainly put, it's like a TED talk for hustlers\nThe evolution of Trap Muzik\nNow, Trap Muzik is just, you know, a dope boy's philosophy\nA former trap nigga's experiences and adventures\nSet to music, but not just, when he cracking a key\nOr when he cooking the work or when he sell it and get busted\nWe know all that, what happen when he go on vacation\nYou know, how is that, what happen when he fall in love?\nOr have his first child\nAll we want to cover all those bases\n'Cause dope boys go through many, many things\nJust because it's trap music, don't mean it got to be one-dimensional\nDiversified vibes"}}, {"title": "The Worst (Remix)", "album": null, "year":

trap\nI said fuck school, it holdin' me back\nI wanna bankroll, chasin' after that\n\n[Hook: Pharrell]\n\n[Verse 3: T.I.]\nLook at me, at 17, livin' on my own, peddlin'\nQuarter ki, now and then sellin' weed\nTotin' tools, caughtt my first felony\nThat's one of many, that were to follow\nDrinkin' Henney up out the bottle\nTote a choppa I think I'm bein' followed\nFamily don't think I'll live to see tomorrow\nPlenty have a story like mine\nKnow many of you had a little nine\nKnow many of you did a little dirt\nToo many of us did a little time\nWake up, 10 years of your life passed\nWhen you get your cake up\nDon't it seem lil' odd when the Feds on your ass passin' out?\n\n[Hook: Pharrell]\n\n[Bridge: Pharrell & T.I.]\nIf you think that you high, baby look above you\nIt's drones in the sky, there's nothing you could do\nSo left, two, three snap\nRight two, three snap\nDon't get serious now it's too late for that\nCause they got\nTime on my side, lil .45 in my jeans\nOpen fire if you seem to be blocking my dreams, yessir\n\n[Hook: Pharrell]"}}, {"title": "The Way We Ride", "album": "Trouble Man: Heavy Is the Head", "year": "2012-12-18", "lyrics": "[Hook]\nSwinging through with

the ceiling\nJust Blaze!\nTip, you ready?\nAight, homeboi\nHere we go\n\nI'm done playing with y'all fuck niggas\nI can't catch all of you but I can make an example out of a couple of you\nEverybody know, real niggas gon' relate to this shit right here, you understand that?\nGrand Hustle, nigga\nEverybody who down with me already know they down with me, so I ain't worried about it\nP$C, pimpin'\nAnybody who know somebody who spit that shit behind they back (What the fuck you said, nigga?)\nBut won't say the same thing when they get in they motherfuckin' face (Yeah, that's what the fuck I thought)\nTell them niggas, I'm talkin' to you , nigga\nDo something about it!\n\n[Hook]\nI'm talkin to you\nSucker nigga you can stunt all ya wanta stunt\nI know you won't bust a gun (Yeah I'm talkin to you)\nFuck nigga you can hate all you wanna hate\nI know you a fake-make no mistake I'm talkin to you\nYouz a lame uz a shame to the game\nI say it you know what ya name is (I'm talkin to you)\nWe can shoot it out whenever you wanna\nWhatever you wanna do boi I'm talkin to you\n\n[Verse One: T.I.]\nAy I'm the best you ever heard about, fresher than you heard about\nYeah I'm strapped now pussy nigga this ain't just word of mouth\nFor niggas wit dirty mouths, I got a lotta clean pistols to wash 'em out\nI'm really finna give yo ass some hotter shit to talk about\nThe goons hit the room now you askin what's this all about\nFo' you know it ya noggins split ya bottom teeth is fallin out\nGot a problem wit patna -I see him in the city and call him out\nIt wasn't for the chopper ain't shit I'm gettin all of mine\nPop 'em drop 'em call the plan a wake he out forever more\nI give it to you straight nigga I don't need a metaphor\nHow many different ways is it to say I'm getting cheddar more\nThan a nigga twice as old way mo' popular and even selling more\nMan I could send you to my pops, maybe he could tell ya better boy\nPatient in the afterlife I'll waste ya in the after life\nEven after my life haters be after my life\nCuz I'mma do in 06 what took 'em half of they life, man I'm talkin to you\n\n[Hook]\nI'm talkin to you\nSucker nigga you can stunt all ya wanta

.44 on the seat\nWith a quarter O of blow, gettin' loaded wit C\nNo tag, no license, trunk loaded with D\nRiding Fulton Indy, where we normally be\nThey pull us over, you think I'm stopping, you must be fucking with me\nIf they don't want to die tonight, they best stop fucking with me\nI'mma pull over in bowen home my cousin and B\nAnd they gon' hide me in they home while they looking for me\n\n[Verse 2: Big Kuntry King]\nHey, we the neighborhood superstars\nCouple Chevys, pulling hard\nThousand dollars worth of dimes in the trap with rockstars\nWe putting fear in cowards' hearts when they see us on the block\nSwerving in the deuce and quarter, busting shots just because\nThe hell I care about getting caught, I'm making bail by twelve o'clock\nBack in the spot with the same bomb-serving drops\nI pull a ho in Bangkok, dropped her off at Tip's spot\nI'm burning rubber, fuck the cops, another day on my block\n\n[Hook x2: T.I.]\n\n[Verse 3: Mac Boney]\nI'm Cadillac daddy, pulled up on some hoes from old Natty\nI said I'm Pimp Squad, ho, what's happening\nWestside get them panties, snap\nShe asked me, can I do the Laffy Taffy?\nI said I do to make the pussy happy\nLet's get a room over on Virginia\nStep inside a suite and then continue\nYou're in for a little fender bender\nBaby, just remember, make it quick\nThese niggas kind of know me, I'm the shit\n\n[Verse 4: C-Rod]\nI'm in a bubble kush Chevy, well at least that's what it smells like\nHit the gas, blue fire blowing out the tailpipe\nTailpipe, that's all these hoes wanna lick for the night\nI treat 'em like Tina, beat that pussy and you call me Ike\nThat's right, monster ride sitting on the twenty-eights\nIt sound like a stadium, you would've thought the Braves played\nThe engine running like Vick, with the Falcons on the hood\nMr., Mr. Westside, yeah you know they in my hood\n\n[Hook x2: T.I.]\n\n[Verse 5: AK]\nAin't no telling where I'm going, 'less I'm stepping out\nSippin on the high life, windows up, in the clouds\nOpen up the console, that's where I got my gun\nRight next to that, get that bag and roll another one\nI got the vitamins, make a freak fuck all night\nHoes know, killers on the Westside earn stripes\nMake that money turn bright, just look at my piece and my grill\nSwerving off Church Street, the pimp God gave me skills\n\n[Verse 6: Young Dro]\nI was born up in Bankhead, y'all remember me\nWay back in '83, T.I. stayed up the street from me\nJust cause I'm from Bankhead, niggas having beef with me\nHalf never seen a G in a cap in my Beamer V\nTen screens falling, my Chevy watching Lean On Me\nRiding down Simpson, 'bout to waste my purple lean on me\nPurple linen clean on me, the whole zone three on me\nWaffle House Charger, yellow-black, I got a bee on

apart from all these frauds\nThey see me get appalled, you know why?\n\n[Hook: Victoria Monet]\nI'm about my issue babe\nAnd you can tell by my name, yeah\nI'm about my issue babe\nWhatever stands in my way, yeah\nOoh, la da da, da da da, la da da da da da da\nOoh, la da da, da da da, la da da da da da da\n\n[Verse 1: T.I.]\nEvery time I take\nPenitentiary chance all I take\nGod with me I'ma find my way\nNigga they ain't even fuck around nowaday\nFeds came in the house, say they found my yay\nA couple handguns and a new SK\nBag full of weed and some Grand Marnier\nBut fuck it though, I gotta keep my grandma straight\nCatch a case, getaway by the grace of God\nStanding on the corner slanging slabs of hard\nJust a young soldier no camouflage\nMan them niggas ain't tough they're just playing hard\nI pull a fuck nigga card on GP\nBetween 'em make 11 mill and peewee\nWe spray your block, turn around, pull up, repeat\nAnd let everybody look at it on TV\nMan I'm certified and I'm gangster\nGetting on the rock like my banker\nI'm in the gated mansion, no neighbor\nNew Italian suits on my hangers\nI got Cuban links and diamond rings\nSolitaires and shiny things\nAye fuck how tough you tryin' to seem\nCome try the king, cause I'm about my\n\n[Hook: Victoria Monet]\nI'm about my issue babe\nAnd you can tell by my name, yeah\nI'm about my issue babe\nWhatever stands in my way, yeah\nOoh, la da da, da da da, la da da da da da da\nOoh, la da da, da da da, la da da da da da da\n\n[Verse 2: T.I.]\nHave you ever heard\nThe point blank blast of a Mossberg?\nWhole block never mind like you've not heard\nLil' nigga keep it moving like they not scared\nAnd out here, it's do or die\nKill after kill in the coupe so fly\nMan the niggas over there tried to shoot your guy\nMan the fully automatic .22 go by like damn\nAnd as fly as I am\nIt's hard for you to tell how high I am\nOh my God damn\nYou see it don't believe it still\nAnd all I ever had\nWas a Glock 23 and an extra mag\nPresidential weed and a extra bag\nTwo or three bad bitches on the jet to France\nWe set to land and I get to the plan\nHow to violate your little sexy ass\nThen get in the Jag, the little Vette crash\nJust ride this till you get to splash\nYou a wild girl, go cowgirl\nKeep the noise down, you loud girl\nTurn down, don't know how girl\nNo white girl cause\n\n[Hook: Victoria Monet]\nI'm about my issue babe\nAnd you can tell by my name, yeah\nI'm about my issue babe\nWhatever stands in my way, yeah\nOoh, la da da, da da da, la da da da da da da\nOoh, la da da, da da da, la da da da da da da\n\n[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle]\nCouldn't listen to niggas they said I dream too much\nHeart fucked up, guess I seen too much\nNumb to it now, bring a gun to it now\nWhen this shit pop I'ma run to it now\nNiggas talk loud but they dumb to announce\nRead he got away so he tryna play it down\nWhen they kick down your door and they run through your house\nCuffs on your wrists and they cussin' you out\nIt'll make sense then\nTelling you that they got your prints then\nWhat's the reward for your risk then?\nNiggas game goofy, this just in\nTime after time\nKnow we need a light nigga, blind lead the blind\nWhy do we ride?\nGrind to provide nigga, not just to shine\nBlood in my eyes\nStress on my mind, let a fly nigga fly\n9 on my side\nGod I'm your child but times are so wild\nPlaying with me\nI'ma draw down and I'ma show out\nIf it gotta go down\nI'm prepared to go now cause\n\n[Hook: Victoria Monet]\nI'm about my issue babe\nAnd you can tell by my name, yeah\nI'm about my issue babe\nWhatever stands in my way, yeah\nOoh, la da da, da da da, la da da da da da da\nOoh, la da da, da da da, la da da da da da da"}}, {"title": "Harry Potter (Remix)", "album": "Fuck Da City Up",

until you dry'em and distribute to the block\nI'm motivated by big faces, I need guack\nMy only fear is God Almighty and snake cops\nSome of my niggas hustlin' and some of 'em knocked\nHow many quit the game and the other was in the box FLYA\n\n[Hook: Yung Booke & T.I.]\nMan, I can't even fit this money in a rubberband\nRight hand get tied I just whip it wit my other hand\nIf I can't make that

don't sell it\nAy, ay, what I blow'll make a plane go\nThem bitches say \"You got some money but you lame\"\nWe blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass\nAnd we blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass\nAnd we blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass\nAnd we blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass\n\n[Verse 1: T.I.]\nMan you so lame, just lookin' at you, nigga\nWhile I'm in here no bitch'll give her pussy to you, nigga, no\nUh-uh, she say \"Not even with a bank roll\"\nCause the king gettin' money when the bank's closed\nYeah, she in her heels on her knees though\nYeah, her nigga call, she don't leave though\nNope, I beat that pussy like she stole somethin'\nUh-huh, then tell that ho get up and roll somethin'\nWe pourin' up, blowin' gas, weed noisy\nShe on that molly, won't stop talkin' and annoyin' me\nI'm like, \"Why don't you suck a nigga's dick or somethin'?\nOr take it from behind while you eat a bitch or somethin'\"\nI like my bitches doubled up like my white cup\nI like my pint sealed up, drank poured up\nYup, and you know you don't wanna catch it\nYou don't wanna see my niggas actin' ratchet with the ratchet\n\n[Hook: T.I.]\nI'm the truth, tell it, loud weed yellin'\nGet it by the pound, we just smoke it, we don't sell it\nAy, ay, what I blow'll make a plane go\nThem bitches say \"You got some money but you lame\"\nWe blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass\nAnd we blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass\nAnd we blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass\nAnd we blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass\n\n[Verse 2: Boosie Badazz]\nI'm a jet fuel smoker, crazy like the Joker\nSuck it 'fore you fuck it is exactly what I told her\nTen bottles, two models, kush sack, it's a jet ride\nGo and get my gangsta ass bitch off the west side\nBaby daddy face lookin' long, better change that, nigga\nMake a nigga drop some change on your lame ass\nBob Marley smoke, spendin' hundred after hundred\nJumped down her throat and in her stomach, now she runnin'\nMe and my henchmen, we be gunnin' for the money, blowin' jet fuel\nWe don't pay for pussy cause we fuck more than we rest, dude\nI bet you that your main bitch'll bless boo\nAnd every ho with her when they see me gon' break their neck too\nRich dick in her, I done gave the bitch life support\nHigh in the pussy same way that I was high in court\nFlip it, slap it, rub it down, finish, give it back up\nWash the dick off while she roll the kush sack up\n\n[Hook: T.I.]\nI'm the truth, tell it, loud weed yellin'\nGet it by the pound, we just smoke it, we don't sell it\nAy, ay, what I blow'll make a plane go\nThem bitches say \"You got some money but you lame\"\nWe blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass\nAnd we blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass\nAnd we blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass\nAnd we blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass\n\n[Verse 3: T.I.]\nBetter kush if them bitches wanna blow, of the blow\nFor the hoes who be playin' with their nose, now you know\nThat the king all about the dollar bills, quarter mil'\nIn the bag, slappin' bitches on their ass with dollar bills\nAy, you don't like it, ho? You ain't gotta chill then\nLeave the lavish match and go back to where you live then\nNope, but you don't wanna do that\nHow this ho blowin' on me, where her trumpet or her flute at?\nI brought a pound and she blew that, see he brought two back\nDrunk up a pint of lean, ain't sleepin', now who can do that?\nShe dippin' all that molly, steady askin' where the food at\nYou don't believe me? Ask my nigga Jeezy, he can true that\nI beat that pussy, blew that, man I ain't gon' finesse it\nMan you know what I'm smokin', shawty you ain't gotta check it\nYou can smell it, this shit I'm blowin' straight up out of D4\nI ain't talkin' but it's loud when the weed blow\nYup, like I'm fresh up on the runway\nWheels up, weed loud like gunplay (pow, pow, pow)\nOn them sucka niggas with their lame ass\nYou bustas blowin' train smoke, we blowin' plane gas\n\n[Hook: T.I.]\nI'm the truth, tell it, loud weed yellin'\nGet it by the pound, we just smoke it, we don't sell it\nAy, ay, what I blow'll make a plane go\nThem bitches say \"You got some money but you lame\"\nWe blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass\nAnd we blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass\nAnd we blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass\nAnd we blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass\n\n[Outro: T.I.]\nWhat you mean, why should you?\nI think a more appropriate question would be why not\nI mean, look around you\nExceptions to circumstances require exceptions to be made\nWould you not consider this exceptional?\nAny sane woman would\nBut it's not so much who I am as what I am\nA stand up guy, man of respect\nThis life of value, you can't just go purchase and put it on, baby\nAnybody say they can, they just puttin' on\nAye, you need to check their certification\nI keep my paperwork"}}], "artist": "T.I."}
