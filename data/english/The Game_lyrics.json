wings)\nReal nigga shit\nOther night at your crib, it was like me, Black, 40, OB\nWe just sittin' there, talkin' 'bout life\nPlayed some beats, but I forgot to tell you one thing\n\n[Verse 1: Game]\nNiggas called me to set you up\nWant me to come and wet you up\nCause you a out of town nigga like Biggie\nHeard about the shit with Diddy\nSo I came through to vest you up\nAnd I got a vest for 40, a vest for Hush\nA vest for every nigga with an owl on his chest and what\nI got L.A. unified\nYou better off committin' suicide, teachers ain't testin' us\nSee, I know how it feel to be platinum-plus\nNiggas is jealous of you, so they try to wrap you up\nTax you up, but it's OVO/Blood Money\nNigga catch these bullets like he catch the bus\nDawg, fame is a motherfucker\nDo a nigga four favors when you can\u2019t do the fifth\nHow soon they forget?\nRun up on you at your granny house, give you nine like Fif'\nHow a nigga s'posed to love you niggas?\nHeart beatin' fast when I dap and when I hug you niggas\nDre told me not to trust you niggas\nYour energy off, you're finicky, I rush you niggas\nJust walkin' 'round the crib like, \"Why a nigga can\u2019t live?\"\nGet this money, fuck these bitches though\nThinkin' 'bout the beef like:\n\"We can pass these mothafuckin' straps like a physical\"\nThis my city, nigga, everybody know it\nRidin' 'round town, just me and my Four Pound\nTucked in my Tom Fords, hopin' I ain't gotta show it\nL.A. niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit\nNiggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard\nLike the Lil Wayne and Baby shit, 40, I'm fucked up\n\n[Hook: Drake + Game]\nY'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit\nY'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit\nY'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do with me\nAll I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hundred\nL.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hundred\nL.A., all I ever asked is one hundred\nL.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hundred\nAll I ever asked is one hundred\n\n[Verse 2: Drake]\nThank me later, thanks for nothin', thanks for bluffin'\nThank you so, so much for wearin' your true colors\nTo every single fuckin' function\nHad niggas tell me to my face how we were family\nAnd how they love me while they were skimmin' off the budget\nNow, when I see 'em, they're the ones that's actin' funny\nPeople been reachin' out to me\nAnd I'm on some straight unresponsive shit\nI would have so many friends\nIf I didn't have money, respect and accomplishments\nI would have so many friends\nIf I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments\nI would have all of your fans\nIf I didn't go pop and I stayed on some conscious shit\nI would have so many more friends\nIf I lost my success and my confidence\nI'm in the club every time that they play the competition\nIf they even play the competition and I seen the response they get\nYeah, nobody's even hearin' it, on top of the pyramid\nMight go to Jamaica, disappear again\nMy circle got so small that it's a period, sayin' to myself...\n\n[Hook: Drake + Game]\nY'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit\nY'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit\nY'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do with me\nAll I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hundred\nL.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hundred\nL.A., all I ever asked is one hundred\nL.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hundred\nAll I ever asked is one hundred\n\n[Verse 3: Game]\nMiss 4 Cent, that was my real nigga\nHeld a nigga down since he was a lil' nigga\nIf he was still alive, he would kill niggas\nHe was Lil Snupe, I was Meek Mill\nNiggas know how it feel when you missin' your nigga though\nCan't think, so you roll up that indigo\nStressin' while drivin' down Figuero'\nBlowin' kush clouds until his ghost is in my Ghost, damn\nMake a real nigga wanna give his life to God like, \"Here it go\"\nScreamin' Frog name at the clouds, they don't hear me though\nGuess they too busy with 2Pac and Biggie though\nYou niggas don't feel me though\nThat was on Suge's watch, I'll take Suge's watch\nYou dissin' Drizzy, that's cool, but don't come to my city though\nNot even to H-Town\nSo underground that I gotta be a trill nigga\nStrapped up from the waist down\nThat's word to Pimp C, J Prince is my real nigga\nShit was so simple when Henchman was out\nHe had a young nigga right there with Meech\nSo happy when Bleu Davinci got out\nWe came up on these California streets\nL.A. niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit\nNiggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard\nLike the Lil Wayne and Baby shit\nGot a nigga confused, but why a nigga gotta choose?\nDon't even matter, dawg, cause I'm a always be a real nigga\nAlways be a real nigga\nI never learned how to be nothin' but a real nigga\n\n[Hook: Drake + Game]\nY'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit\nY'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit\nY'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do with me\nAll I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hundred\nL.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hundred\nL.A., all I ever asked is one hundred\nL.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hundred\nAll I ever asked

Cardo]\n\n[Intro: Game]\n(Johnny Juliano)\n(Cardo got wings)\nReal nigga shit\nOther night at your crib, it was like me, Black, 40, OB\nWe just sittin' there, talkin' 'bout life\nPlayed some beats, but I forgot to tell you one thing\n\n[Verse 1: Game]\nNiggas called me to set you up\nWant me to come and wet you up\nCause you a out of town nigga like Biggie\nHeard about the shit with Diddy\nSo I came through to vest you up\nAnd I got a vest for 40, a vest for Hush\nA vest for every nigga with an owl on his chest and what\nI got L.A. unified\nYou better off committin' suicide, teachers ain't testin' us\nSee, I know how it feel to be platinum-plus\nNiggas is jealous of you, so they try to wrap you up\nTax you up, but it's OVO/Blood Money\nNigga catch these bullets like he catch the bus\nDawg, fame is a motherfucker\nDo a nigga four favors when you can\u2019t do the fifth\nHow soon they forget?\nRun up on you at your granny house, give you nine like Fif'\nHow a nigga s'posed to love you niggas?\nHeart beatin' fast when I dap and when I hug you niggas\nDre told me not to trust you niggas\nYour energy off, you're finicky, I rush you niggas\nJust walkin' 'round the crib like, \"Why a nigga can\u2019t live?\"\nGet this money, fuck these bitches though\nThinkin' 'bout the beef like:\n\"We can pass these mothafuckin' straps like a physical\"\nThis my city, nigga, everybody know it\nRidin' 'round town, just me and my Four Pound\nTucked in my Tom Fords, hopin' I ain't gotta show it\nL.A. niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit\nNiggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard\nLike the Lil Wayne and Baby shit, 40, I'm fucked up\n\n[Hook: Drake + Game]\nY'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit\nY'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit\nY'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do with me\nAll I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hundred\nL.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hundred\nL.A., all I ever asked is one hundred\nL.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hundred\nAll I ever asked is one hundred\n\n[Verse 2: Drake]\nThank me later, thanks for nothin', thanks for bluffin'\nThank you so, so much for wearin' your true colors\nTo every single fuckin' function\nHad niggas tell me to my face how we were family\nAnd how they love me while they were skimmin' off the budget\nNow, when I see 'em, they're the ones that's actin' funny\nPeople been reachin' out to me\nAnd I'm on some straight unresponsive shit\nI would have so many friends\nIf I didn't have money, respect and accomplishments\nI would have so many friends\nIf I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments\nI would have all of your fans\nIf I didn't go pop and I stayed on some conscious shit\nI would have so many more friends\nIf I lost my success and my confidence\nI'm in the club every time that they play the competition\nIf they even play the competition and I seen the response they get\nYeah, nobody's even hearin' it, on top of the pyramid\nMight go to Jamaica, disappear again\nMy circle got so small that it's a period, sayin' to myself...\n\n[Hook: Drake + Game]\nY'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit\nY'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit\nY'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do with me\nAll I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hundred\nL.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hundred\nL.A., all I ever asked is one hundred\nL.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hundred\nAll I ever asked is one hundred\n\n[Verse 3: Game]\nMiss 4 Cent, that was my real nigga\nHeld a nigga down since he was a lil' nigga\nIf he was still alive, he would kill niggas\nHe was Lil Snupe, I was Meek Mill\nNiggas know how it feel when you missin' your nigga though\nCan't think, so you roll up that indigo\nStressin' while drivin' down Figuero'\nBlowin' kush clouds until his ghost is in my Ghost, damn\nMake a real nigga wanna give his life to God like, \"Here it go\"\nScreamin' Frog name at the clouds, they don't hear me though\nGuess they too busy with 2Pac and Biggie though\nYou niggas don't feel me though\nThat was on Suge's watch, I'll take Suge's watch\nYou dissin' Drizzy, that's cool, but don't come to my city though\nNot even to H-Town\nSo underground that I gotta be a trill nigga\nStrapped up from the waist down\nThat's word to Pimp C, J Prince is my real nigga\nShit was so simple when Henchman was out\nHe had a young nigga right there with Meech\nSo happy when Bleu Davinci got out\nWe came up on these California streets\nL.A. niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit\nNiggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard\nLike the Lil Wayne and Baby shit\nGot a nigga confused, but why a nigga gotta choose?\nDon't even matter, dawg, cause I'm a always be a real nigga\nAlways be a real nigga\nI never learned how to be nothin' but a real nigga\n\n[Hook: Drake + Game]\nY'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit\nY'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit\nY'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do with me\nAll I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hundred\nL.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hundred\nL.A., all I ever asked is one hundred\nL.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hundred\nAll I ever asked is one hundred"}}, {"title": "Ali Bomaye", "album": "Jesus Piece", "year": "2012-12-11", "lyrics": "[Intro: Game]\nGet my people out them chains, nigga\nI

martian)\n\n[Verse 1: The Game]\nBlood gang kill 'em all, Odd Future Wolf Gang\nKidnap a vampire, drain all his fuckin veins\nWolf Grey Jordans, use his intestines for the strings\nSnatch up Rihanna and throw her in front of a fuckin' train\nSniff a fucking unemployment line of cocaine\nTie Lil B up to a full tank of propane\nSwag, now watch him cook...and just stand there and look\nHave a bonfire with old Harry Potter books\nMartians vs. Goblins, goons vs. the crooks\nAnd since me and Tune had Viacom shook\nI shoulda got a real-ass pirate to do the hook\nMaybe Jack Sparrow maybe Peter Pan's nemesis\nMy power's limitless like Blanka on Sega Genesis\nSuperhero, mad that Marvel overlooked me\nCause Spiderman and Hulk straight pussy\n\n[Hook: Lil Wayne]\nBitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)\nBitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)\nBitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)\nWe are not the same, I am a Martian\n\n[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]\nA year ago, I was poor, somewhat\nNow my future's brighter than Christopher's new haircut\nBruno Mars is still sucking dick and fucking male butts\nIn the same closet that Tyler Perry gets clothes from\nI suck? Where the fuckin Ring Pops?\nYou got a better chance of getting a copy of Detox\nWolf Gang, we rock, crack rock and that shit was expected\nLike Jayceon whenever he name-drop (Fuck you, Tyler)\nJesus, motherfucking Theresa\nThis nigga Game got Wolf Haley for this feature\nMy team is running shit like we have full-cleat Adidas\nGetting chased by the polices on a full bred Cheetah\nBishop Eddie caught me tryna escape\nBag full of drag and a Nicki Minaj mixtape\nDragging all you fags to the back of the log cabin\nFall back like Lebron's hairline against the Mavericks, he lost\n\n[Hook: Lil Wayne]\nBitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)\nBitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)\nBitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)\nWe are not the same, I am a Martian\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\n(Chuck, fuck wit' me) I do\nCause Lil Tunechi always bless me (achoo)\nHe killed me on my own track, so what?

It enhances human metabolism, increases respiration rate, and raises blood pressure. It has a very high visibility, which is why stop signs, stop lights, and fire equipments are usually painted red. It also represents one third of California's gang population. Needless to say, please dress accordingly while visiting the Los Angeles area. Also, tuck your jewellry, and keep your hands inside your vehicle. Thank you!

angels in the city\n\n[Verse 1: The Game]\nTell them mothafuckas I'm forever paid\nCalifornia king, wrestle gators in the Everglades\nDrive up out that mothafuckin' swamp in the Escalade\nSo before you put that red rag in your pocket\nI wanna see your fuckin' r\u00e9sum\u00e9\nStarted off on Ground Zero, then I start to levitate\nRip rappers a new asshole \u2013 I never hesitate\nDre Beats on, smokin' that chronic just to meditate\nI'ma give 'em hurricanes until another levee break\nYou niggas is featherweights, I'm Aftermath's heavyweight\nNow Dre's weapon of mass destruction is 'bout to detonate\nWhen a nigga Wack found me, shit, I was sellin' weight\nNow a nigga's sellin' millions, now it's time to celebrate\nPerformin' in front of millions, nigga, every race\n64 in the '64, now watch the Chevy scrape\nFourth album, no five mics? Then let 'em hate!\nBut I'm not stoppin' till I'm the fuckin' king in every state\n\n[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]\nRecognize my life, ridicule my fight\nGive me fuel for the fire burnin' when I yearn these lights\nIn the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write\nGet familiar with Cartwright, \u2018cause I want that shot\nI'm a raging bull when the needle drops\nFor the record, I'ma wreck it, even if my record don't pop\nI'ma tie a knot on a downtown buildin'\nLet it tow behind me, tell 'em they can find me\nIn the dark with the ghetto children\nLook at my heart, nigga, fuck your feelings, this is me\n\n[Verse 2: The Game]\nI'm sick of mothafuckas talkin' about \"the West died\"\nCan't you hear my heart beatin'? That's the motherfuckin' Westside\nYou test me, you test God, I'm His son\nIt say in Psalms, you come at me\nThen I can split you with this Tommy gun\nYou won't have no time to run\nI'm from the Compton slums, and that's how the West ride\nI'm from the city where two of the best died\nRest in peace to both of 'em, spit like I'm the ghost of 'em\nDamn, I said I spit like I'm the ghost of 'em\nName your top 10, I'm harder than the most of 'em\nMatter of fact, shorten your list, nigga, top 5\nGame, Biggie, Hov\u2026 probably Pac, Nas\nNo particular order, bet a mill' that I slaughter\nServe niggas, give a fuck what you ordered\nHow dare you niggas pop fly, when I'm the nigga?\nSold 5 mill' out the gate, and numbers do not lie\n\n[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]\nRecognize my life, ridicule my fight\nGive me fuel for the fire burnin' when I yearn these lights\nIn the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write\nGet familiar with Cartwright, \u2018cause I want that shot\nI'm a raging bull when the needle drops\nFor the record, I'ma wreck it, even if my record don't pop\nI'ma tie a knot on a downtown buildin'\nLet it tow behind me, tell 'em they can find me\nIn the dark with the ghetto children\nLook at my heart, nigga, fuck your feelings, this is me\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nI gave you The Documentary, shit was a classic\nGave you Doctor's Advocate, you ripped it out the package\nCame with LAX, since critics said it was average\nI was stressed the fuck out, torn between Aftermath and\nGeffen, Interscope, now I got you in the scope\nSpill the red ink on the paper, it's like my pen is broke\nAnd this is what you all been waitin' for\nI'm the lost angel knockin' on Satan's door\nWhat the fuck y'all take me for?\nI love you \u2018cause you hate me more\nI'm Kobe on the Lakers floor, except I give you 84\nShake you like Haiti's floor\nWalk up on you, like, \"What's goin' on, baby boy?\"\nShots in that Mercedes door\nEither I'm crazy or the black Slim Shady or\nCould that be the reason that Baby said he would pay me more?\nBut I still owe Jimmy one more album\nThe best the West has ever seen, no disrespect to Calvin\n\n[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]\nRecognize my life, ridicule my fight\nGive me fuel for the fire burnin' when I yearn these lights\nIn the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write\nGet familiar with Cartwright, \u2018cause I want that shot\nI'm a raging bull when the needle drops\nFor the record, I'ma wreck it, even if my record don't pop\nI'ma tie a knot on a downtown buildin'\nLet it tow behind me, tell 'em they can find me\nIn the dark with the ghetto children\nLook at my heart, nigga, fuck your feelings, this is me\n\n[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]\nKendrick, and I wear pendant on my shoulder\nSoldier, like a lieutenant\nAnd the coupe tinted, got pulled over\nJohnny always lock a nigga down, knowin' damn well\nWe don't wanna see the box like Manny Pacquiao\nLittle nigga Mayweather size\nRide like Pac in his prime; Thug Life is now on radar\n'Til the federal come through and raid ours\nReminiscin' when the L.A. Raiders\nWas in my home, snapback fitted on my uncle's dome\nAnd I don't condone dickridin'\nI'm addicted to Westsidin'\nLivin' in a city where the skinny niggas die\nAnd the semi bullets fly, but it turned me to a lion\nTryin'\u2026 and I mean that shit\nGame came through, put the city on his back\nI was in the city with a nigga, had seen that shit\n\"Compton!\" \u2013 a nigga gotta scream that shit\nNever went commercial, never TV-screened that shit\nCan't block or screen that shit\nNow everybody sing that shit!\n\n[Outro]\nRed is a very emotionally and intense color. It enhances human metabolism, increases respiration rate, and raises blood pressure. It has a very high visibility, which is why stop signs, stop lights, and fire equipments are usually painted red. It also represents one third of California's gang population. Needless to say, please dress accordingly while visiting the Los Angeles area. Also, tuck your jewellry, and keep your hands inside your vehicle. Thank you!

Cent]\nComing up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl\nConfusion occurs coming up in the cold world\nDaddy ain't around, probably out committing felonies\nMy favorite rapper used to sing, \"Check check out my melody\"\nI wanna live good so, shit, I sell dope\nFor a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes\nNana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat\nIf I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope\nTossed and turned in my sleep that night\nWoke up the next morning, niggas had stole my bike\nDifferent day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood\nI'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent + The Game]\nHate it or love it, the underdog's on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop\nGo 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P\nAnd I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me\nHate it or love it, the underdog's on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop\nGo 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P\nAnd I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me\n\n[Verse 2: The Game]\n(G-G-G-G-G-Unit!) On the grill of my lowrider\nGuns on both sides, right above the gold wires\nI'll fo'-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song\nAnd really do it, that's the true meaning of a ghostwriter\nTen G's will take your daughter out her Air Forces\nBelieve you me, homie, I know all about losses\nI'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious\nOne phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy\nI stay strapped, like car seats\nBeen bangin' since my lil nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys\nThat's ten years, I told Pooh in ninety-five\nI'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's\nTold Banks when I met him I'ma ride\nAnd if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide\nI ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died\nNow I'm going back to Cali\nWith my Jacob on, see how time fly?\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent + The Game]\nHate it or love it, the underdog's on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop\nGo 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P\nAnd I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me\nHate it or love it, the underdog's on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop\nGo 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P\nAnd I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me\n\n[Bridge: 50 Cent]\nFrom the beginning to the end\nLosers lose, winners win\nThis is real, we ain't got to pretend\nThe cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain\nEnough of me, nigga, now listen to Game\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nUsed to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench\nNow I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense\nMy moms happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent\nAnd she got a red bow on that brand new Benz\nWaiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range\nThinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes\nWhen there's kids starvin'\nPac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage\nI wanna know what's going on, like I hear Marvin\nNo schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins\nWhenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted\nI think: What if Marie Baker got that abortion? I love you, ma\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent + The Game]\nHate it or love it, the underdog's on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop\nGo 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P\nAnd I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me\nHate it or love it, the underdog's on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop\nGo 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P\nAnd I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me"}}, {"title": "Celebration", "album": "Jesus Piece", "year": "2012-09-02", "lyrics": "[Produced by SAP]\n\n[Bridge: Tyga, Lil Wayne & (Chris Brown)]\nGet high, get high, get high, get high,

dogs, barkin' and shit\n(Don't shoot, don't shoot!)\nFuck you, nigga!\n\n[Hook: Lil Wayne]\nAnd I'm grindin' till I'm tired\n\u2018Cause they said: \"You ain't grindin' till you tired.\"\nSo I'm grindin' with my eyes wide\nLookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night\nDear Lord, you done took so many of my people\nI'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life\nLike what the hell am I doin' right? My life\n\n[Verse 1: The Game]\nTake me away from the hood, like a state penitentiary\nTake me away from the hood, in a casket or a Bentley\nTake me away, like I overdosed on cocaine\nOr take me away, like a bullet from Kurt Cobain\nSuicide, I'm from a windy city, like Do or Die\nFrom a block close to where Biggie was crucified\nThat was Brooklyn's Jesus, shot for no fuckin' reason\nAnd you wonder why Kanye wears Jesus pieces?\n\u2018Cause that's Jesus, people \u2013 and Game, he's the equal\nHated on so much, Passion of Christ need a sequel\nYeah, like Roc-a-Fella needed Siegel\nLike I needed my father, but he needed a needle\nI need some meditation so I can lead my people\nThey askin', \"Why, why did John Lennon leave The Beatles?\"\nAnd why every hood nigga feed off evil?\nAnswer my question 'fore this bullet leave this Desert Eagle\n\n[Hook: Lil Wayne]\nAnd I'm grindin' till I'm tired\n\u2018Cause they said: \"You ain't grindin' till you tired.\"\nSo I'm grindin' with my eyes wide\nLookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night\nDear Lord, you done took so many of my people\nI'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life\nLike what the hell am I doin' right?

I earned 'em\nAnd I ain't no preacher, but here's my Erick Sermon\nSo eat this black music and tell me how it taste now\nAnd fuck Jesse Jackson, \u2018cause it ain't about race now\nSometimes I think about my life, with my face down\nThen I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile\nDamn, I know his mama proud; and since you helped me sell my dream, we can share my mama now\nAnd like M.J.B. no more drama now\nLivin' the good life, me and Common on common ground\nI spit crack, and niggas could drive it out of town\nGot a Chris Paul mindstate, I'm never out of bounds\nMy life used to be empty like a Glock without a round\nNow my life full like a chopper with a thousand rounds\n\n[Hook: Lil Wayne]\nAnd I'm grindin' till I'm tired\n\u2018Cause they said: \"You ain't grindin' till you tired.\"\nSo I'm grindin' with my eyes wide\nLookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night\nDear Lord, you done took so many of my people\nI'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life\nLike what the hell am I doin' right? My life\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nWalk through the gates of hell, see my Impala parked in front\nWith the high beams on, me and the devil sharin' chronic blunts\nListenin' to the Chronic album, playin' backwards\nShootin' at pictures of Don Imus for target practice\nMy mind fucked up, so I cover it with a Raider hood\nI'm from the city that made you motherfuckers afraid of Suge\nMade my grandmother pray for good\nIt never made her happy, but I bet that new Mercedes could\nAin't no bars, but niggas can't escape the hood\nAnd it took so many of my niggas that I should hate the hood\nBut it's real niggas like me that make the hood\nRidin' slow in that Phantom just the way I should\nWith the top back, in my Sox hat\nI'm paid in full, the nigga Alpo couldn't stop that\nEven if they brought the nigga Pac back\nI'd still keep this motherfucker cocked back\n\n[Hook: Lil Wayne]\nAnd I'm grindin' till I'm tired\n\u2018Cause they said: \"You ain't grindin' till you tired.\"\nSo I'm grindin' with my eyes wide\nLookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night\nDear Lord, you done took so many of my people\nI'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life\nLike what the hell am I doin' right?

me in my sleep, you bitch-ass nigga?\n2Pac, Biggie \u2013 shut the fuck up!\nFuckin' dogs, barkin' and shit\n(Don't shoot, don't shoot!)\nFuck you, nigga!\n\n[Hook: Lil Wayne]\nAnd I'm grindin' till I'm tired\n\u2018Cause they said: \"You ain't grindin' till you tired.\"\nSo I'm grindin' with my eyes wide\nLookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night\nDear Lord, you done took so many of my people\nI'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life\nLike what the hell am I doin' right? My life\n\n[Verse 1: The Game]\nTake me away from the hood, like a state penitentiary\nTake me away from the hood, in a casket or a Bentley\nTake me away, like I overdosed on cocaine\nOr take me away, like a bullet from Kurt Cobain\nSuicide, I'm from a windy city, like Do or Die\nFrom a block close to where Biggie was crucified\nThat was Brooklyn's Jesus, shot for no fuckin' reason\nAnd you wonder why Kanye wears Jesus pieces?\n\u2018Cause that's Jesus, people \u2013 and Game, he's the equal\nHated on so much, Passion of Christ need a sequel\nYeah, like Roc-a-Fella needed Siegel\nLike I needed my father, but he needed a needle\nI need some meditation so I can lead my people\nThey askin', \"Why, why did John Lennon leave The Beatles?\"\nAnd why every hood nigga feed off evil?\nAnswer my question 'fore this bullet leave this Desert Eagle\n\n[Hook: Lil Wayne]\nAnd I'm grindin' till I'm tired\n\u2018Cause they said: \"You ain't grindin' till you tired.\"\nSo I'm grindin' with my eyes wide\nLookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night\nDear Lord, you done took so many of my people\nI'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life\nLike what the hell am I doin' right? My life\n\n[Verse 2: The Game]\nWe are not the same, I am a Martian\nSo approach my Phantom doors with caution\nYou see them 24's spinnin'? I earned 'em\nAnd I ain't no preacher, but here's my Erick Sermon\nSo eat this black music and tell me how it taste now\nAnd fuck Jesse Jackson, \u2018cause it ain't about race now\nSometimes I think about my life, with my face down\nThen I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile\nDamn, I know his mama proud; and since you helped me sell my dream, we can share my mama now\nAnd like M.J.B. no more drama now\nLivin' the good life, me and Common on common ground\nI spit crack, and niggas could drive it out of town\nGot a Chris Paul mindstate, I'm never out of bounds\nMy life used to be empty like a Glock without a round\nNow my life full like a chopper with a thousand rounds\n\n[Hook: Lil Wayne]\nAnd I'm grindin' till I'm tired\n\u2018Cause they said: \"You ain't grindin' till you tired.\"\nSo I'm grindin' with my eyes wide\nLookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night\nDear Lord, you done took so many of my people\nI'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life\nLike what the hell am I doin' right? My life\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nWalk through the gates of hell, see my Impala parked in front\nWith the high beams on, me and the devil sharin' chronic blunts\nListenin' to the Chronic album, playin' backwards\nShootin' at pictures of Don Imus for target practice\nMy mind fucked up, so I cover it with a Raider hood\nI'm from the city that made you motherfuckers afraid of Suge\nMade my grandmother pray for good\nIt never made her happy, but I bet that new Mercedes could\nAin't no bars, but niggas can't escape the hood\nAnd it took so many of my niggas that I should hate the hood\nBut it's real niggas like me that make the hood\nRidin' slow in that Phantom just the way I should\nWith the top back, in my Sox hat\nI'm paid in full, the nigga Alpo couldn't stop that\nEven if they brought the nigga Pac back\nI'd still keep this motherfucker cocked back\n\n[Hook: Lil Wayne]\nAnd I'm grindin' till I'm tired\n\u2018Cause they said: \"You ain't grindin' till you tired.\"\nSo I'm grindin' with my eyes wide\nLookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night\nDear Lord, you done took so many of my people\nI'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life\nLike what the hell am I doin' right?

She tellin' me a nigga had her caged in\nEvery time she think about me on the road\nShe be cryin' realizin' all the places that she ain't been\nWell it's cool, I'll pick you up, hold you down, lift you up\nThese other niggas try and fuck\nI'm the only one who cut and still came back to stitch you up\nSo we fuck, say what? You ain't been home lately\nYou ain't heard that nigga? Her man left cause she cheated on his ass\nFound her pills in a bag, yo she burned that nigga\n(She burned that nigga)\nSay what? She burned that nigga (she burned that nigga)\nSay what? She burned that nigga\nDawg, she burned that nigga\nHe beat her ass in the crib then he went and did a bid\nAll cause a bitch burned that nigga\nNow dog, that's real ass shit\nThat's word around the ville ass shit\nDid you strap up? Did you the strap up?\nPlease tell me that you strapped up nigga\nWe could kill that bitch if you want to\nI'm cool, I strapped up, played by the rules, damn\nWhile I'm sittin' here blessed, she at the crib all alone and she stressed\nSo nigga I\n\n[Chorus: Game & J.

in the club\nThis, is, how, we, do\nNobody do it like we do it so show us some love\nThis, is, how, we, do\nWe make a move and act a fool while we up in the club\nThis, is, how, we, do\nNobody do it like we do it so show us some love\n\n[Verse 1: The Game]\nFresh like, uhh, Impala, uhh\nChrome hydraulics, 808, drums\nYou don't want, none, nigga better, run\nWhen beef is on, I'll pop that, trunk\nCome get, some, pistol grip, pump\nIf a nigga step on my white Air, Ones\nIt's red-rum, ready, here I come\nCompton, uhh, Dre found me in the slums\nSellin' that skunk, one hand on my gun\nI was sellin' rocks when Master P was sayin' \"Uhhhh!\"\nBuck pass the blunt\nThese G-Unit girls just wanna have, fun\nCoke and rum, got weed on the ton\nI'm bangin' with my hand up her dress like, uhh\nI'll make her cum, purple haze in my lungs\nWhole gang in the front in case a nigga wanna stunt\n\n[Verse 2: 50 Cent]\nI put Lamborghini doors on that Escalade\nLow pro, so look like I'm ridin' on blades\nIn one year mayne, a nigga's so paid\nI have a straight bitch in the telly goin' both ways (ahh!)\nTouch me, tease me, kiss me, please me\nI give it to you just how you like it, girl\nYou're now I'm rockin' with the best\nTre pound on my hip, teflon on my chest\nThey say I'm no good, cause I'm so hood\nRich folks do not want me around\nCause shit might pop off, and if shit pop off\nSomebody gon' get laid the fuck out\nThey call me new money, say I have no class\nI'm from the bottom, I came up too fast\nThe hell if I care, I'm just here to get my cash\nBougie-ass bitches, you can kiss my ass\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nThis, is, how, we, do\nWe make a move and act a fool while we up in the club\nThis, is, how, we, do\nNobody do it like we do it so show us some love\nThis, is, how, we, do\nWe make a move and act a fool while we up in the club\nThis, is, how, we, do\nNobody do it like we do it so show us some love\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nI put gold Daytonas on that cherry six-fo'\nWhite walls so clean it's like I'm ridin' on Vogues\nHit one switch mayne, that ass so low\nCali got niggas in New York ridin' on hundred spokes\nTouch me, tease me, kiss me, please me\nI give it to you just how you like it, girl\nYou're now I'm rockin' with the best\nFour pound on my hip, gold chain on my chest (ahh!)\n\n[Verse 4: 50 Cent & The Game]\n50, uhh, Bentley,

always, let me\nWork you out for the weekend\nBaby, I'm a beast, uh-huh\nCan you tame me?\nI'm gon' let it out\nLay you down\n\n[Verse 1: The Game]\nLet's get to it\nLet me lick you in places you never been licked before\nTake you to places you never been before\nLike London, Paris, see that Lamborghini outside\nWe can share it, J and B without the marriage\nHorse and carriage, se\u00f1orita\nSnapchat dog filters live from Ibiza\nBreakfast on the beach, that mean sex is on the beach\nYou lookin' like a fruit platter, I'ma bite into your peach\nAnd um, I think about to massage your feet\nAnd um, you got a body, you remind of my Jeep\nAnd um, I must look amazing with you\nCause every time you on my arm I got\n\n[Chorus: Jeremih]\nAll eyes on me\nI need your attention\nPut your body on me\nYou the one I'm missin'\nAll eyes on me\nI don't want your love\nWe ain't gotta fake it\nWe both tryna fuck\nAll eyes on you\n\n[Verse 2: The Game]\n'Member when you used to curved me, leave my text message unread?\nAnd every time I asked to see you, you say you goin' to bed\nEvery time I hit you with the good morning you say you workin'\nNow you in my living room twerkin', that's crazy\nYou wear that body suit, I know you tryna tease me\nI put on that Tiller, she'd rather fuck me to Weezy\nI remember when your money was young\nAnd you stripped all week just to get the tan Yeezy's\nBack when lame niggas hit you with the one liners\nAll sounding the same like Future and Desiigner\nNow that's my vagina, she told me to sshh\nWe in the Chanel store and\n\n[Chorus: Jeremih]\nAll eyes on me\nI need your attention\nPut your body on me\nYou the one I'm missin'\nAll eyes on me\nI don't want your love\nWe ain't gotta fake it\nWe both tryna fuck\nAll eyes on you\n\n[Verse 3: Jeremih]\nLookin' at me like you love me\nWe can do it now or later\nShe wan' lick on party favorite\nOn my wave, tryna surf it up\nKnow we gettin' gnarly, smokin' Marley, burnin' up\nCertified with the double-M pullin' up\nTooly got a room, we'll play \"Room Up In Here\", been here\nGirl, you know my intentions\nI put you on the wall like a picture\nRound after round to decisions\nSay you wanna show me what I'm missin'\nAll the lights low, but we lit up\nI don't let you down if I get up\nLike you got a man, but you're fed up\nBut you know when we get together\n\n[Collision: The Game]\nYou want me to say your name, huh?\nKarrueche!\n\n[Chorus: Jeremih]\nAll eyes on me\nI need your attention\nPut your body on me\nYou the one I'm missin'\nAll eyes on me\nI don't want your love\nWe ain't gotta fake it\nWe both tryna fuck\n\n[Outro: Jeremih]\nAll eyes on me\nAll eyes on me"}}, {"title": "Bigger Than Me", "album": "Blood Moon: Year Of The Wolf ",

ain't Pun, you ain't Pac, you ain't Biggie to me\nThese niggas ain't Crips, they ain't 60's to me\nThese niggas ain't Bloods, they ain't dripping with me\nNiggas talking that shit 'bout the new generation, man\nFuck these niggas, I'll slash your fucking faces\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou niggas ain't sold shit, not an album or a rock\nPussy nigga putting rings on my old bitch\nDick down the throat ass niggas, old ho' ass niggas\nHappy cause you went gold ass niggas\nThese niggas ain't spitting with me, you ain't sicker than me\nFuck out my section, you ain't sitting with me\nThis for very important people, it's clear that we not equal\nClear you niggas faggots, I'm the black Marshall Mathers\nLike \"ying, ying, ying\" on a motherfucker\nWho needs Hulk Hogan when you got Sting on this motherfucker?\nLess than five albums, Kiss the Ring on this motherfucker\nCalifornia throne and I'm the King on this motherfucker\nI don't wanna hear it \u2013 weak ass lyrics\nCrying on the hook, thinking we gon' feel it\nOld lost ass niggas, voice crack when you talk ass niggas\nRolling blunts for the boss ass niggas\nI came in with 'Ye, Jeezy and boss ass niggas\nYour Freshman cover a whole bunch of soft ass niggas\nTampon lyricists, evacuate the premises\nMute BET cyphers cause I don't wanna hear that shit\nMay you rest in piss, you fuck niggas\nAyy Frank Ocean, go ahead and fuck these fuck niggas\n(Yeah, they fuck niggas) Ain't no 3 Stacks in your class\nTake your Top 10 spot and shove it up your ass, bitch boy\n\n[Bridge]\nNiggas already fucked your bitch, you bitch boy\nAnd every time you kiss on that ho you suck my dick, you bitch boy\nAnd when you buy that ho a bag that bitch carry my bricks, you bitch boy\n\n[Verse 2]\nI was in the XXL, Red Chucks 'round my neck\nI was the G in the Unit, had Buck round my set\nWord to the Rhymes, had Busta Bus round my set\nGave Whoo Kid a Glock in case they bust round my set\nI'm from Compton where that Glock can't fuck with that Tec\nThat's on Bompton, 40 Glocc got socked in his neck\nThis is Spawn in the flesh, you a pawn hit reset\nFive in the chest, I'm Makaveli the Don in the vest\nDon't say \"What's up\" when you see me, you a pussy nigga\nStrang\u00e9, fake ass Kanye, fake ass Weezy\nFake ass jewelry, how I know? I'm at the pawn shop\nNigga better off jacking Flav for his alarm clock\nSpeaking of time, how much more 'til the Game drop\nSo you can suck my dick and Complex can count my name drops\nI been the underdog, I'm cool in my dog house\nFuck all these pussys, give me any name to call out\nLeft Aftermath, Dre told me ball out\nStunna put me on a private jet then we balled out\nLanded in Miami, met some bitches ate 'em all out\nBlack Marshall Mathers, time to show 'em what it's saw about\n\"Ying, ying, ying\" on a motherfucker\n\"Ying, ying, ying\" on a motherfucker\n\n[Hook]\nThese niggas ain't

to me\nThese niggas ain't Bloods, they ain't dripping with me\nNiggas talking that shit, 'bout a new generation\nOld emoji ass rappers, all their smiley ass faces\nFuck niggas\n\n[Outro]\nFrank Ocean go ahead and fuck these fuck niggas\nYeah they fuck niggas\n\"Ying, ying, ying\" on a motherfucker\n\"Ying, ying, ying\" on a motherfucker\n\"Ying, ying, ying\" on a motherfucker\n\"Ying, ying, ying\"

brought\u2014dreams\"\n\"\u2014dreams\"\n\"\u2014dreams\"\n\"And I brought you all my dreams 'cause I love you\"\n\"I\u2014love you\"\n\"I\u2014love you\"\n\"I-I-I love you\"\n\n[Verse 1: The Game + Sample]\nI woke up out that coma 2001\n'bout the same time Dre dropped 2001\nThree years later the album is done\nAftermath presents: Nigga Witta Attitude, Volume One\nRap critics politickin', wanna know the outcome\nReady to Die, Reasonable Doubt, and Doggystyle in one\nI feel like 'Pac after the Snoop Dogg trial was done\nDre behind that G series and All Eyez on Me\nI watched the death of a dynasty, so I told Vibe Magazine\nWorkin' with Dr. Dre was a (\"Dream\")\nI had visions of makin a classic, then my world turned black\nLike I was starin' out of Stevie Wonder's glasses\nIt's kinda hard to imagine, like Kanye West\nComing back from his fatal accident to beatmakin' and rappin'\nBut, we the future, Whitney Houston told me that\nAnd it's gon' take more than a bullet in the heart to hold me back\n\n[Hook: The Game + Sample]\nBlushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed\nCause Martin Luther King had a (\"Dream\")\nAaliyah had a (\"Dream\"), Left Eye had a (\"Dream\")\nSo I reached out to Kanye and (\"I brought you all my dreams 'cause I love you\")\n(\"I\u2014love you\"\n\"I\u2014love you\"\n\"I-I-I love you\")\n\n[Verse 2]\nI had dreams of fuckin' a R&B bitch like Mya\nWhen I saw that ass on the front of that King\nRead the article in the magazine, she loved gangsters, loved nasty things\nSo I'm in the glass house having nasty dreams\nGood girls never give it up\nBut anything is possible, if 50 fucked Vivica\nHurdled life's obstacles, found my way through the maze\nThen joy turned to pain like Frankie Beverly and Maze\nUsed to dream of being Unsigned Hype\n'til I was crushed by Dave Mays, almost let my pen fall asleep on the page\nDaydreamin' yesterday, dozin' off backstage\nI thought I saw Eazy talking to Jam Master Jay\nSo I walked over, heard Jam Master say\n\"It's a hard knock life, then you pass away\"\nThey say sleep is the cousin of death, so my eyes wide open\nCause a dream is kin to your last breath\n\n[Hook]\nBlushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed\nCause Martin Luther King had a (\"Dream\")\nAaliyah had a (\"Dream\"), Left Eye had a (\"Dream\")\nSo I reached out to Kanye and (\"I brought you all my dreams 'cause I love you\")\n(\"I\u2014love you\"\n\"I\u2014love you\"\n\"I-I-I love you\")\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe dream of Huey Newton, that's what I'm livin' through\nThe dream of Eric Wright, that's what I'm givin' you\nWho walked through the White House without a business suit\nCompton hat, jheri curl drippin' on Ronald Reagan's shoes\nGave Mike Lem my demo, came here to pay my dues\nStarted off with Whoo Kid, then I start blazin' Clue\nIt was all a dream like Big said it'd be\nDon't sleep on me homey, I bring nightmares to reality\nRap phenomenon, defyin' the rules of gravity\nStudied all the classics, start revisin' my strategy\nCause Marshall Mathers made it, Curtis Jackson made it\nHead in the clouds, wonderin' where the hell Marvin Gaye went\nHow do I say this? I'm livin' for my son\nBut I can't figure out, why I'm at my temple with this gun\nWake up to a Jesus piece, like a catholic nun\nThe war to be a rap legend has just begun\n\n[Hook]\nBlushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed\nCause Martin Luther King had a (\"Dream\")\nAaliyah had a (\"Dream\"), Left Eye had a (\"Dream\")\nSo I reached out to Kanye and (\"I brought you all my dreams 'cause I love you\")\n(\"I\u2014love you\"\n\"I\u2014love you\"\n\"I-I-I love you\")\n\n[Outro: The Game + Sample]\nThis song is dedicated to Yetunde Price\nThe sister of Venus and Serena Williams\nWho was slain during a gang shootout in Compton\nSunday, September 14th, 2003: rest in peace\n(\"I brought you all my dreams 'cause I love you\")\n(\"I\u2014love you\"\n\"I\u2014love you\"\n\"I-I-I love you\")\n(\"And I brought\u2014\"\n\"And I brought\u2014\"\n\"And I brought\u2014dreams\"\n\"\u2014dreams\"\n\"\u2014dreams\")\n(\"And I brought you all my dreams 'cause I love

dude\nLet's hit the Roscoe's on Pico, I'm in a hood mood\nI'm sittin' here thinkin' 'bout all the things I could do\nSo what you should do is play your position for Birkin bags\nWe poppin' tags, her shoe game sick\nWe drinkin' Ace out of red bottles, true gang shit\nFuck with me and you're famous\nKanye'd my bitch, now she\u2019s away from the nameless\nCamera flashes from strangers, turn a Range to a manger\nJesus piece on the plates, yeah my baby an angel\nFell straight up out of Heaven into what we into\nWho knew we'd grew into, whatever we into\nThat's too much for your mental, so we snapback that\nGame on point like the stripes on my Gucc backpack\nMy ladybug, yea she cool like that\nIn them Trues, why you move like that\n\n[Chorus: Jeremih]\nYou know my lady always on\nShe know I need it so\nShe know she can get\nAll that, all that, all that, all that, all that\nMy lady got me going\nI'm where she already knows\nShe know she can get\nAll that, all that, all that\n\n[Verse 2: Lil\u2019 Wayne]\nUh, you my lady\nAnd that pussy feel like a haven\nWe can make babies, let's be creative\nShe say leave them tricks alone but I\u2019m a skater\nI love her like her daddy told her no man would\nI got a lot of bad bitches, she the only one good\nI get her flowers for nothing, she smiling and blushing\nIf I don't answer my phone, then we probably fucking, and yeah\nShe love my tattoos\nAin't got no room for her name but I'ma make room\nShe let her hair down, we have a stare down\nShe said \u201cI\u2019m glad you ate it,\" where my cap & gown?\nTold her, \"I can be your chauffeur\", dick like a limo\nMultiple orgasms, that\u2019s my M.O., haha\nRedbone pretty\nI kiss her from her titty to her clitty, Tunechi\n\n[Chorus: Jeremih]\nYou know my lady always on\nShe know I need it so\nShe know she can get\nAll that, all that, all that, all that, all that\nMy lady got me going\nI'm where she already knows\nShe know she can get\nAll that, all that, all that\n\n[Verse 3: Big Sean]\nSean Don, whoa\nLook, my girl's sweet like my hotel floor\nFrom where they ran through more keys than a hotel door\nIndeed, give her the D now the whole hotel know\nFeel like I'm looking down from Heaven\nScreaming, \"Oh, Hell no!\"\nWhen you hop on top, girl, that's what it feel like\nShe always had a player back like them field lights\nAnd every time I left it ain't feel right\nCheated on her and she stayed, that's just real life (shit)\nCause it's hard when you ain't on the same coast\nBurning bread in the club so all these girls want toast\nHoes try and wade but we ain't on the same boat\nThey trying to sink everything that we made float\nShe told me 'bout her ex man, her old boy stories\nAnd how she had a dildo, you know, toy stories\nDon't fuck her on her period, ain't into horror stories\nI take her to my favorite restaurant, she order for me\n'Cause she know me\n\n[Chorus: Jeremih]\nYou know my lady always on\nShe know I need it so\nShe know she can get\nAll that, all that, all that, all that, all that\nMy lady got me going\nI'm where she already knows\nShe know she can get\nAll that, all that, all that\n\n[Outro: Fabolous]\nIt make sense right, yeah\nGirl look, I'm feeling your style\nI'm loving your swag\nI like how your jeans fit\nYou're killing that bag\nYou working them heels\nYour diamonds are real\nYou give me the chills, girl\nYou're all that...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/58f6594ea2322bebbcbe4b92483dc999.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "The Game", "raw": {"annotation_count": 20, "api_path": "/songs/97996", "apple_music_id":

1: The Game]\nYou know I love you like cooked food, I'm a good dude\nLet's hit the Roscoe's on Pico, I'm in a hood mood\nI'm sittin' here thinkin' 'bout all the things I could do\nSo what you should do is play your position for Birkin bags\nWe poppin' tags, her shoe game sick\nWe drinkin' Ace out of red bottles, true gang shit\nFuck with me and you're famous\nKanye'd my bitch, now she\u2019s away from the nameless\nCamera flashes from strangers, turn a Range to a manger\nJesus piece on the plates, yeah my baby an angel\nFell straight up out of Heaven into what we into\nWho knew we'd grew into, whatever we into\nThat's too much for your mental, so we snapback that\nGame on point like the stripes on my Gucc backpack\nMy ladybug, yea she cool like that\nIn them Trues, why you move like that\n\n[Chorus: Jeremih]\nYou know my lady always on\nShe know I need it so\nShe know she can get\nAll that, all that, all that, all that, all that\nMy lady got me going\nI'm where she already knows\nShe know she can get\nAll that, all that, all that\n\n[Verse 2: Lil\u2019 Wayne]\nUh, you my lady\nAnd that pussy feel like a haven\nWe can make babies, let's be creative\nShe say leave them tricks alone but I\u2019m a skater\nI love her like her daddy told her no man would\nI got a lot of bad bitches, she the only one good\nI get her flowers for nothing, she smiling and blushing\nIf I don't answer my phone, then we probably fucking, and yeah\nShe love my tattoos\nAin't got no room for her name but I'ma make room\nShe let her hair down, we have a stare down\nShe said \u201cI\u2019m glad you ate it,\" where my cap & gown?\nTold her, \"I can be your chauffeur\", dick like a limo\nMultiple orgasms, that\u2019s my M.O., haha\nRedbone pretty\nI kiss her from her titty to her clitty, Tunechi\n\n[Chorus: Jeremih]\nYou know my lady always on\nShe know I need it so\nShe know she can get\nAll that, all that, all that, all that, all that\nMy lady got me going\nI'm where she already knows\nShe know she can get\nAll that, all that, all that\n\n[Verse 3: Big Sean]\nSean Don, whoa\nLook, my girl's sweet like my hotel floor\nFrom where they ran through more keys than a hotel door\nIndeed, give her the D now the whole hotel know\nFeel like I'm looking down from Heaven\nScreaming, \"Oh, Hell no!\"\nWhen you hop on top, girl, that's what it feel like\nShe always had a player back like them field lights\nAnd every time I left it ain't feel right\nCheated on her and she stayed, that's just real life (shit)\nCause it's hard when you ain't on the same coast\nBurning bread in the club so all these girls want toast\nHoes try and wade but we ain't on the same boat\nThey trying to sink everything that we made float\nShe told me 'bout her ex man, her old boy stories\nAnd how she had a dildo, you know, toy stories\nDon't fuck her on her period, ain't into horror stories\nI take her to my favorite restaurant, she order for me\n'Cause she know me\n\n[Chorus: Jeremih]\nYou know my lady always on\nShe know I need it so\nShe know she can get\nAll that, all that, all that, all that, all that\nMy lady got me going\nI'm where she already knows\nShe know she can get\nAll that, all that, all that\n\n[Outro: Fabolous]\nIt make sense right, yeah\nGirl look, I'm feeling your style\nI'm loving your swag\nI like how your jeans fit\nYou're killing that bag\nYou working them heels\nYour diamonds are real\nYou give me the chills, girl\nYou're all that..."}}, {"title": "The Documentary", "album": "The Documentary", "year": "2005-01-18", "lyrics": "[Intro]\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhat

"[Verse 1: The Game]\nI don't read the XXL\nTote a .45 the church, think I'm destined for hell, oh well\nBlood tears off the face of my Jesus Piece\nIt's bloodshed, feel the cracks in my city streets\nI'm from the crack of them city streets\nUsed to sell crack in them city streets, born in Blood, nigga\nIn a coma five days, life of a thug nigga\nMomma ain't show, grandma almost pulled the plug nigga\nUsed to pull the gun out, just because of cuz niggas\nFive shots to the head 'cause I'm a Blood nigga\nNuttin' brewing but suwoo'ing where the fuck I'm from\nYou lucky if you make it out of Compton, ask Andre Young\nSmell the scent of dead bodies ridin' down Green Leaf\nNo peace so don't get caught up with no piece\nFuck Fatburger, we cooking that real beef\nMommas mourning they sons, I'm talking real grief\nReal funerals of them lost Juveniles\nTrying to be generals, be missing your dinner now, huh\nSay its a blessing when you die in ya sleep\n'Cause the coroner don't need no sheets, capisce?\nI'm sayin', stop playing, wrap him up in what he lay in\nFold a nigga arms, now a casket what he pray in\nCompton streets raised me\nCan't tell my grandma nothing 'bout her baby, you crazy\n\n[Chorus: Tank]\nI said she see no evil, she don't hear nothing at all\nYou want to see tomorrow, you promise not to talk\nSay we on our way now, I'ma see you again\nAnd when they ask you questions, you just answer\nWhat happened then? What happened then?\n\n[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]\nI live this life at a pace that anyone can go\nKnow your place and dedicate your role, to the faith that you'll die alone\nTrace your steps when I do step in a fire of broken bones\nAnd I require my heart's desire and when I reap what I sew\nI bought my momma a Benz, my boobie a Jag\nA car for my dogs, with a roof full of glass\nBut still I be feeling like none of my light never casts\nOut of that black cloud that's been watered down since my first chopper blast\nBut fuck that, I'm not worried, even when it's scary\nSkrrt off makin' them hurt off I should have hurt them in a hurry\nDirt off all under my fingers, dirt all of 'em gon is gone\nShirt off when precedure, resuscitation came early\nI need you to keep quiet as a mouse\nWhich is ironic 'cause rats is what I'm talking about\nI'm hearin the sonics of gun fire\nThe whispers, the silent cries\nEven though I know it's an eye for an eye\n\n[Chorus: Tank]\nI said she see no evil, she don't hear nothing at all\nYou want to see tomorrow, you promise not to talk\nSay we on our way now, I'mma see you again\nAnd when they ask you questions, you just answer\nWhat happened then? What happened then?\n\n[Bridge: Tank]\nI was born a soldier, ride or die for mine\nTattooed tears and a lawyer, tried to give me life\nHeaven can you hear me? I know that hell can\nSo heaven can you heal me? I'm only just a man, ooooohhhhh\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nYou want to go to Compton? Nigga I'll take you there\nHub City bodies get burnt butt-naked here\nRespect the code, a nigga's calling from the pen\nColombian neck-ties on the outside from within\nAnd then, your momma never see you again\nCasket to never wake up plastered in MAC make-up, huh\nNiggas can\u2019t hear you talking from the sky\nAnd only five year olds see your ghost when you die, no lie\nKarma catches up to all you head honchos\n2 dome shots in that head, Griselda Blanco\nShit get real though inside the Foxhills though\nNigga living that fast life and get killed slow\nAsk Wack and Draws if a nigga run the streets\nMy grandmother\u2019s prayers saved you niggas I never wanted peace\nLos Angeles, I\u2019m the motherfucking King here\nNo first 48 'cause muh'fuckers don\u2019t sing here, huh\n\n[Chorus: Tank]\nI said she see no evil, she don't hear nothing at all\nYou want to see tomorrow, you promise not to talk\nSay we on our way now, I'ma see you again\nAnd when they ask you questions, you just answer\nWhat happened then?

Meek accused Game\u2019s crew of robbing Kingston.\n\nThe song actually contains a little over 92 bars, coming in at 111. The title is likely a reference to Game\u2019s upcoming album, 1992. \u201c92 Bars\u201d appears as track 12 on the album.\n\nMeek was quick to respond on Instagram, saying in the caption:\n\nU wanna fight? Next morning a diss raps\u2026\u2026 Then the pre-order links! THE JIG IS UP YALL GUYS REAL RAPPERS! Make sure y'all go support them industry cats!\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BKbX_nNBv2i/"}, "comment_count": 1, "community": true, "custom_preview": null, "has_voters": true, "id": 10448231,

Game like Tyson Beckford six pack\nPresidential Rollie, nigga, where your wrist at?\nI can kill you in four bars, that's a Kit Kat\nDid the Lambo my way with a sick wrap\nSmooth as Frank Sinatra with a motherfucking slick back\nNo rats in my pack, ain't no wrinkles in my slacks\nCounting singles in my Shaqs, stacking Pringles from the crack\nNigga I was on the bus with it\nHad 12 stuck to my chest in the field with the colt\nAndrew Luck with it\nWe had the rock, hit the block like what's up with it\nJay was in the Z, my young gunnas in the truck with it\nSigel would've loved it, Philly would've fucked with it\nCalifornia state property you niggas stuck with it\nBrrrring, sold Peedi Crakk\nGame was on the block in his beanie with a Mac\nI'm what you rap niggas 'fraid of\nA Compton nigga that could go bar for bar with Jada\nLet me tell you who suck, like banana Now or Laters\nBlac Chyna head the bomb, al-Qaeda\nListen, you want beef I'll cater\nGame snap on everything he like a fucking wild gator\nSilver and black Ghost, nigga that's Al Davis\nGive me Left Eye back, take Fetty Wap and the Raiders\nThe Rams is back, them bullets getting tossed\n16 on your back like you fucking Jeff Goff\nYour man acting girly too put 30 on his chest\nKanye shrug bitch, welcome to the west\nYG, Nipsey, and Kendrick yea check\nShout 'em out I just do it like a fucking Nike rep\nBentley truck Chuck, with the Henny cupped up\nDon't get me fucked up, you see the semi tucked, duck\nPass the Goose, where them duck ducks?\nThese hoes foaming at the mouth, they got Penny fucked up\nI'm 'bout to poke 'em like a cactus\nTold that bitch to roll the Philly for the game, and she talking about practice\nThe Maybach is A.I\nArtificial intelligence motherfucker that's Junior Seau\nAll my doors suicide, I'm in Vegas shoot the five\nTell the dealer pay me don't be shy he ain't from Do or Die\nNow do you wanna ride, back seat of my Caddy?\nUsed to flip them pies ain't no relation to Patti\nAnd I move Ps, ain't no relation to Swaggy\nBefore that it was missing teeth and nickel sack baggies\nThat's caine, no daddy cause I ain't really have one\nAnd you can't call yourself dope if you ain't never bag none\nI'm the old DMX you niggas Drag-On\nGame raw as fuck like poking holes in the Magnum\nUsed to ether the niggas in all of my 16s\nNow I scare 'em once a year like I'm fucking Halloween\nThis ain't a dream, nigga hurricane a nightmare\nStab you in your sleep and smack your baby out his highchair\nYour daddy was a bitch, I had to do it\nI ain't need no ski mask to do it\nMurder is Rihanna and I'm attracted to it\nName a state, I'll send a package through it\nIf the fed hack into it, they get bossed on like I'm Massachusetts Huh!\nSitting in this Maybach with music\nYour head is like Mustard beat and I'll put the ratchet to it\nPARTY sent my jackas to it\nDrama bring the Mac into it\nAnd this scope will get your mouth washed when I attach it to it\nGold on my neck, I make your bitch put her back into it\nUsain Bolt if you bring a real track into it\nAnother classic moving the way to Aftermath to do it\nDre had the Chronic all I did was put the matches to it\nTraffic moving backwards through it\nEver since I had the Buick\nKnown for putting cheese on niggas heads the way the Packers do it\nAnd I had the yay, yea I brought crack to music\nEvery situation in rap, I've been a savage through it\nAnd all these hoes getting mad cause I'm smashing through 'em\nThey can get a ring one day, if the Cavs can do it\nBe LeBron bitch, I'm Jayceon bitch\nWho else you seen parked at the swap meet in James Bond shit?\nAnother foreign car driven by a convict\nAventador matte black Akon lips\nNas ether niggas, Game napalm shit\nNiggas say my name I pop up like the State Farm bitch\nNo nigga can see me, on or off TV\nGum bottom Yeezys, I'm the 6' 5\" Eazy\nLightskin bitches be mad and talking greasy\nI'ma start fucking them Dej Loafs and Dreezy's\nI'ma start beefing with Cole, Drizzy and Cornrow Kenny\nOr you could pick your favorite rapper, and he gon' be pouring out Henny\nI got a bitch from Minne-Apolis pack a semi\nBang the ratchet at Denny's and fly herself back to Philly\nShe got a couple mill and she don't even know Meek\nAnd ever since that nigga snitched on me we just don't speak\nSee that shit you got with Drake is like a slow leak\nBlood'll be dripping like Niagara if I poke Meek\nNicki won't get no sleep, I'm coming through at 4 a.m\nFour deep, to leave his dead body on the soaked sheets\nIt could happen lowkey\nYou better have Ross call me or you gon' be eye level with a roach feet\nThis ain't a diss, nigga\nThis is all lives matter except this nigga's\n\n[Outro: The Game]\nThis 1992 shit ain't no new shit\nWe in that all black you won't know who Blood and who Crip\nWith guns big enough to sink a fucking cruise ship\nFuck around and be a news clip with them loose lips\nMy nigga Drizzy packed you out and you ain't do shit\nThis the Golden State and my shooters ain't on no hoop shit\nNigga, you know that I'll snap you like a toothpick\nAnd snitching on niggas ain't never been no cool shit\nAnd I've been wanting to give Nicki this pool stick\nSo tell your lil' vivrant thing come fuck with Q-Tip\nWe know where you live, nigga, you better move quick\nAnd start thinking twice about

features\nDraw closer to a true blood bleeder, soul of a southern preacher\nWent from dinner with bottom feeders to world leaders\nWe throw the peace up, knowing that the world need us\nEagerness to live life and see the bright lights\nTo sacrifices we made it's sorta Christ-like\nAt the after party thinking what the afterlife's like\nHe paid for our sins, is it really priced right?\nFuck it, I

Big\nMade a nigga feel ashamed of the the city where he live\nMake a nigga hate the logo on the Dodger cap\nThinking back to that beamer, wish my nigga Pac was strapped\nBut I'm dreaming Las Vegas Boulevard, Afeni's son's bullet scars\nEverybody king of Diamonds until the feds pull they cards\nNot the deck though\nHip Hop was better off when it was just Dre, Scarface, and Esco\nMemoirs of the gold chain\nIt's a cold game nigga, Johnny Coltrane\nBlack Versaces with the gold frame\nNigga said he sold 'caine that's a bold claim\n14 had a brain that could throw flames\nSo strange, have to blow they mind, Cobain\n\n[Chorus: Game & Kanye West]\nMama forgive me cause I'm tryna make a living, hah\nThem niggas hatin' cause that Royce Phantom killing, hah\nNiggas shining like they hanging from the ceiling, hah\nMe and 'Ye killing (Something like my Jesus piece, hah)\nLord willin', I see a billion\n'Til then, I let my nuts hang (Something like my Jesus piece)\nThrow them suicide doors up\nAnd let that Holy Ghost swang (Something like my Jesus piece)\n\n[Verse 2: Game]\nThat's the crack music, nigga\nNever spit a verse cause I was making trap music, nigga\nI'm not an army, I'm a movement\nThe flow is water, Andre tried to Ice Cube him\nIce Cubin', roof translucent\nChick on my side tryna get my Trues loose\nWhen I'm talkin' 'bout God, she 'posed to bow her head\nNow she all on the blog, steady postin' 'bout her head\nGot me thinking like a father, is the world safe?\nGot me clinging to my daughter like shark fins in water\nRocks in my ears sunk the Titanic\nThis is my life and it's exactly how I planned it, damn it\nGod says everything happens for a reason\nI seen four seasons at The Four Seasons\nTake that chinchilla off, poor kids is freezing\nCookin' up in the same pot they ain't got to pee in\n\n[Chorus: Game & Kanye West]\nMama forgive me cause I'm tryna make a living, hah\nThem niggas hatin' cause that Royce Phantom killing, hah\nNiggas shining like they hanging from the ceiling, hah\nMe and 'Ye killing (Something like my Jesus piece, hah)\nLord willin', I see a billion\n'Til then, I let my nuts hang (Something like my Jesus piece)\nThrow them suicide doors up\nAnd let that Holy Ghost swang (Something like my Jesus piece)\n\n[Verse 3: Common]\nPieces on gold leashes\nCruisers, around greases make them cohesive\nI'm the sun shining with God features\nDraw closer to a true blood bleeder, soul of a southern preacher\nWent from dinner with bottom feeders to world leaders\nWe throw the peace up, knowing that the world need us\nEagerness to live life and see the bright lights\nTo sacrifices we made it's sorta Christ-like\nAt the after party thinking what the afterlife's like\nHe paid for our sins, is it really priced right?\nFuck it, I see the light, broads, they see the light\nCan't deny my Jesus piece that\u2019s so Peter-like\nChicks crow for dough, get low for mo'\nA convo piece, she end up at the condo\nAnother Jane Doe or a golden angel\nPendant on an angle, watch the chain glow\n\n[Chorus: Game & Kanye West]\nMama forgive me cause I'm tryna make a living, hah\nThem niggas hatin' cause that Royce Phantom killing, hah\nNiggas shining like they hanging from the ceiling, hah\nMe and 'Ye killing (Something like my Jesus piece, hah)\nLord willin', I see a billion\n'Til then, I let my nuts hang (Something like my Jesus piece)\nThrow them suicide doors up\nAnd let that Holy Ghost swang (Something like my Jesus piece)"}}, {"title": "Church", "album": "Jesus Piece", "year": "2012-12-11", "lyrics": "[Hook:

On\n\n[Verse 1: The Game]\nBack when Dot was hangin' out at Top's in the Benzo\nFreestylin' to them Chronic instrumentals, no pens and pencils\nI was out there Bloodin' like a menstrual\nWith a Backwood clinched between my dentals, way back when\nWhen we was outside with the indo\nHotboxin' rentals in front of Centennial, remedial thoughts\nNever thought that I would amount to shit\nSmoke chronic, fuck bitches, ride around bouncin' shit\nFrom Impalas to that Harley truck, to dishraggin' bitches\nThat was hard to fuck, I came up, it was hardly luck\nJust left Compton, and I ain't have to use my AK\nWhat a day, what a day\n\n[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]\nBack when my driver's license, was baby faced and triflin'\nI made my way through crisis, I made my tape\nAnd recorded portraits in front of sirens, I made you hate the vibrant\nYou can't escape the tyrant, you can't relate where I've been\nIn '98 my problem, actin' too grown and shit\nCappin' at bitches, yeah my religion through songs and shit\nOn me, that's on me\nRaise up, nigga, you are not the homie\nBitch I\u2019m well-connected from my section down to Long Beach\nFumblin' with Tetris if your block neglectin' your ki\nEveryday I wake up with my face up to my father\nMakin' sure my heart is pure enough to grow my seed and harvest\nAll my king is stuffin', double up my plantation with dollar\nEvery dream is such reality, my d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu done caught up\nBitch I'm brought up with the homies, that's on me\n24/7, Kendrick revvin' these cold streets\nDon't we live by it, die by it, then reincarnate\nAnd if Game told me, \"Drive by it,\" I raise AK\nAin't no shame on it, cry about it, fuck that, I'll play\nLike no name on it, blindsided, ain't no one safe\nDocumentary had identities of where I'm from\nTherefore my energy had to make sure the better me won\nIt ain't no better one, son, it ain't no tellin' me nothin'\nNigga that's Chuck, Doc Dre and K, the legacy's done, BLAOW!\n\n[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]\nOh man, you thought these niggas with attitude would show gratitude\nFooled you\nFrom 2015 to infinity it's still bomb weed and Hennessy\nI can pimp a butterfly for the energy\nGame I

kiss\nA fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like\nArm hangin' out the window\nOf that black Ghost with them chrome pipes\nTell them niggas it's gon' be a long night\nBitches wanna chill, we gon' need

shake hands\nPut a gap in your mouth, Strahan\nHundred racks in these cargos\nPush the button, these cars go\nSix cradle that 'Lago\nSix spades, black card hoe\nGot homies out in Chicago\nWith that full clip on that bullshit\nDang nigga, that's Rozay\nMovin' packs on 'em in MJs\nI got a thick bitch with a thin waist\nGot a condo where somethin' slim stay\nGot a Rolex Presidente\nGot black diamonds, Kunta Kinte\nHot boy like Turk and them\nHot wheels, we swervin' them\nNext year we gettin' Deron Williams\nGon' do LeBron like Dirk and them\n\n[Verse 2: Chris Brown]\nA fuck nigga that's that shit I don't like\nThey throwin' bottles, I'm throwin' models, just 'cause I gave a bitch long pipe\nDoin' shows on the soccer field, that's dome right\nI be singin', he be singin' so it's on,

shot, robbed, stabbed, chased home, socked out\nJabbed by esse's, cops, degenerate niggas with rags\nDisintegrate niggas went into me, dome shots like Kennedy\nSlugs drippin' with Hennessey, got murderous tendencies\nAnd if you don't know where the fuck they got me from\nMartin Scorsese when I pull out my gun\nScarface, car chase, tell me how your blood taste\nAsk your baby mama, she'll tell you how a Blood taste\nBasket case, still I'm back with Dre, wait I never left\nRun up in Beats, \"Bitch pass the safe! Compton\"\nProduced by a billion in this motherfucker\nStill smoking, Dre we need a ceiling in this motherfucker\nCompton! They're killing in this motherfucker\nThey're drilling in this motherfucker\nLock the door, they're stealing in this motherfucker\nNo chains, no reins, this my home\nNigga this hub city, no fly zone\nNiggas pull out burners\nStart breaking like turbo on ozone\nCrack fiends on the back streets\nWhere the tracks lean and the needles lay\nAnd switchblades, if you bitch made\nPut chili all on your Frito Lay's\nWhere we dream of Montego Bay\nBut all we got is the swap meet\nWhere the cops meet, go bang bang\nLeaves blood stains on the concrete\nAnd I'm the only nigga bumping Mobb Deep\nCause I mob deep down that side street\nI'm a West side rider, live with gats on collars\nDon't hate me, better get your dollars\nI be on Rosecrans with a Glock in both hands\nLeaning on that Brougham\nFlamed up like a coke can with my name on it\n\n[Outro: Asia Bryant]\nAnother day in Compton, the thrill is high\nKnow somebody's watching, but I don't know why\nFeel the fire burning, it touches the sky\nFeeling coming at you, I won't die tonight\nSo I get by, I get by\nI get by, I get, I get by\nCause it's just another day in Compton", "image": "https://images.genius.com/19804ba7a9b6ceb36d0158950514927a.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "The Game", "raw": {"annotation_count": 17, "api_path": "/songs/2270746", "apple_music_id": "1027466850", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/2270746/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "\u201cJust Another Day\u201d is the 11th track on \u201cCompton\u201d and follows after \u201cOne Shot, One Kill\u201d.

grandma coffee table\nThat's how you remember it, that's how I remember it\nYeah, dip into the liquor store, .9 in my khaki's\nCrips tryna get at me, my red Impala bumping like acne\nMy city a trap me; been shot, robbed, stabbed, chased home, socked out\nJabbed by esse's, cops, degenerate niggas with rags\nDisintegrate niggas went into me, dome shots like Kennedy\nSlugs drippin' with Hennessey, got murderous tendencies\nAnd if you don't know where the fuck they got me from\nMartin Scorsese when I pull out my gun\nScarface, car chase, tell me how your blood taste\nAsk your baby mama, she'll tell you how a Blood taste\nBasket case, still I'm back with Dre, wait I never left\nRun up in Beats, \"Bitch pass the safe! Compton\"\nProduced by a billion in this motherfucker\nStill smoking, Dre we need a ceiling in this motherfucker\nCompton! They're killing in this motherfucker\nThey're drilling in this motherfucker\nLock the door, they're stealing in this motherfucker\nNo chains, no reins, this my home\nNigga this hub city, no fly zone\nNiggas pull out burners\nStart breaking like turbo on ozone\nCrack fiends on the back streets\nWhere the tracks lean and the needles lay\nAnd switchblades, if you bitch made\nPut chili all on your Frito Lay's\nWhere we dream of Montego Bay\nBut all we got is the swap meet\nWhere the cops meet, go bang bang\nLeaves blood stains on the concrete\nAnd I'm the only nigga bumping Mobb Deep\nCause I mob deep down that side street\nI'm a West side rider, live with gats on collars\nDon't hate me, better get your dollars\nI be on Rosecrans with a Glock in both hands\nLeaning on that Brougham\nFlamed up like a coke can with my name on it\n\n[Outro: Asia Bryant]\nAnother day in Compton, the thrill is high\nKnow somebody's watching, but I don't know why\nFeel the fire burning, it touches the sky\nFeeling coming at you, I won't die tonight\nSo I get by, I get by\nI get by, I get, I get by\nCause it's just another day in Compton"}}, {"title": "Good Girls Go Bad", "album": "The R.E.D. Album", "year": "2011-08-19", "lyrics": "[Verse 1: The Game]\nSince Big ain't here, I'm about to do it for T'yanna\nAnd put roses on the grave of Kanye's mama\nThis for all the lost girls locked up in the pen\nAll the girls that hold it down, getting beat on by they man\nRespect women, I don't care if they a 2 or a 10\nWe don't beat on Kat Stacks, we just bring it to an end\nAnd we don't wanna see Nicki fighting Lil Kim\nThere\u2019s missing women out there, let\u2019s just focus on them\nThis song is dedicated to Natalie Holloway\nI feel for her daddy so I wrote this on father's day\nI know she gone, but she ain't far away\nI just had a daughter, pass me that cigar 'Ye\nI'm 'bout to tell a story, everybody parlay\nSit back listen while I kick it, the Compton Boulevard way\nMy daddy used to beat up on my mama all day\nSo I took my Chronic album and slept in the hallway\nI learned this the hard way, when police came our way\nMy daddy had his act on like it never happened (Broadway)\nPlus I was kinda scared to keep it real with you\nNow my mama good, nigga she ain't gotta deal with ya\nYou want some money nigga? I ain't get a deal with ya\nYou ain't saying nothing, you like a still picture\nYou better thank God you still breathing air\nCause you coulda went out like your boy Steve McNair\n\n[Hook]\nDon't make the good girls go bad, no\nDon't make the good girls go bad, no (I won't)\nIf you don't, you gon\u2019 really love us  (I said I won't)\nPlease don\u2019t use us, dooon\u2019t\n\n[Verse 2: Drake]\nGood evening, I'm in Chicago at the Elysian\nWith some girls that say they models but umm, I don't believe 'em\nWho's still getting tested?\nWhere's all the women that still remember who they slept with?\nWhere's all the girls too busy studying to make the guest list\nBut when you do go out, you still working what you was blessed with?\nDo it girl, I'll be the king to your Queen Latifah\nI love your ass like Milhouse loved Lisa\nI love your ass like the Ninja Turtles love pizza\nIronically enough, you something I want a piece of, you got it girl\nThis song remind me of Cat from Philly, a girl I used to love\nUntil she started acting silly, her heart's a little chilly\nShe a little too carefree in 10 years\nWho's paying for all that therapy? Umm, nigga not me, yeah\nI'm probably not the man you take me for\nBut I bet I could be if you make me yours\nMost of the shit I say is true\nWhen I\u2019m done with bad bitches, know I\u2019m coming straight to you good girl\n\n[Hook]\nDon't make the good girls go bad, no\nDon't make the good girls go bad, no\nIf you don't, you gon\u2019 really love us\nPlease don\u2019t use us, noo\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nDrizzy, I'm sitting here watching Basketball Wives\nLike, \"uhh, them is basketball wives?\"\nOnly cute one, Gloria, that's my nigga Matt Barnes' chick\nCan't swim in that poon fool, that's a crucial conflict\nNever sleep with the wife of niggas you eat with\nAnd never buy a chick a bag on the first date\nI pop a bottle with her on her birthday and tell her ass \"get on!\"\nDisrespect my chick, that type of shit'll get you spit on\nI don't hit on girls, I just hit on girls\nLike \"hey lil mama, come in Game and Drizzy's world\"\nGet busy girl, drink that ros\u00e9 'til you're dizzy girl\nShe walking around the club all lost, like where is he girl?\nHe on the top of the charts, next to Beyonce\nRight under Kanye, so let the Don spray\nThat\u2019s your girl? Nigga go on and make her cry\nSoon as you do, I'm pulling up in that Porsche like \"let's ride\"\n\n[Hook]\nDon't make the good girls go bad, no\nDon't make the good girls go bad, no\nIf you don't make the good girls go bad, no\nDon\u2019t make the good girls go bad, no\nIf you don't, you gon\u2019 really love us\nPlease don\u2019t use us, nooo\n\n[Verse 4: The Game]\nWord on the news stand, Alicia got herself a man\nAnd thats my nigga Swizzy, know you see Game and Drizzy\nSurrounded by them diamonds, I'mma cold mackin\nNigga its a cold climate, don\u2019t ask me where the crime went\nJust tell me where them dimes went\nSo I can get em fitted, let em beat a bridesmaid at the wedding for my niggas\nYeah I\u2019m married to the game\nAnd she married to my chain, watching Boyz n The Hood\nLets take a drive down memory lane", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5f5301fa46a1afd76d0d034e80d23434.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "The Game", "raw": {"annotation_count": 20, "api_path": "/songs/54090", "apple_music_id": "455366994", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/54090/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "Drizzy + Game on the RED album (SOO-WOO) \u2013 this track has a throwback feel to it, due to the Cool & Dre production"}, "embed_content": "<div id='rg_embed_link_54090' class='rg_embed_link' data-song-id='54090'>Read <a href='https://genius.com/The-game-good-girls-go-bad-lyrics'>\u201cGood Girls Go Bad\u201d by The\u00a0Game</a> on Genius</div> <script crossorigin src='//genius.com/songs/54090/embed.js'></script>", "featured_video": false, "full_title": "Good Girls Go Bad by\u00a0The\u00a0Game (Ft.\u00a0Drake)", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5f5301fa46a1afd76d0d034e80d23434.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5f5301fa46a1afd76d0d034e80d23434.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 54090, "lyrics_owner_id": 7, "lyrics_state": "complete", "path": "/The-game-good-girls-go-bad-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 13, "recording_location": "Encore Studios, Burbank, CA", "release_date": "2011-08-19", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5f5301fa46a1afd76d0d034e80d23434.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5f5301fa46a1afd76d0d034e80d23434.1000x1000x1.jpg", "stats": {"accepted_annotations": 16, "contributors": 85, "hot": false, "iq_earners": 85, "transcribers": 4, "unreviewed_annotations": 2, "verified_annotations": 1, "pageviews": 128550}, "title": "Good Girls Go Bad", "title_with_featured": "Good Girls Go Bad (Ft.\u00a0Drake)", "url": "https://genius.com/The-game-good-girls-go-bad-lyrics", "current_user_metadata": {"permissions": ["see_pageviews", "view_apple_music_player", "create_comment", "view_song_story_gallery"], "excluded_permissions": ["follow", "award_transcription_iq", "remove_transcription_iq", "pyong", "edit_lyrics", "view_annotation_engagement_data", "publish", "unpublish", "edit_spotify_details", "hide", "unhide", "toggle_featured_video", "add_pinned_annotation_to", "add_community_annotation_to", "destroy", "mark_as_not_spam", "edit_spotify_annotations_for", "verify_lyrics", "unverify_lyrics", "edit_anything", "edit_any_media", "edit", "rename", "edit_tags", "watch_fact_track", "reindex", "view_lyrics_synchronization", "enable_media", "disable_media", "edit_lyrics_or_annotation_brackets", "see_editorial_indicators", "view_attribution_visualization", "edit_annotation_brackets", "preview_lyrics_for_export", "hide_apple_player", "unhide_apple_player", "trigger_apple_match", "mark_lyrics_evaluation_as_approved", "mark_lyrics_evaluation_as_staff_approved", "mark_lyrics_evaluation_as_unapproved", "mark_lyrics_evaluation_as_un_staff_approved", "view_transcriber_media_player", "override_apple_match", "edit_youtube_url", "edit_soundcloud_url", "edit_spotify_uuid", "edit_vevo_url", "moderate_annotations", "create_annotation", "see_short_id", "manage_chart_item", "create_tag", "propose_lyrics_edit", "moderate_lyrics_edit_proposals"], "interactions": {"pyong": false, "following": false}, "relationships": {}, "iq_by_action": {}}, "album": {"api_path": "/albums/9859", "cover_art_url": "https://images.genius.com/5f5301fa46a1afd76d0d034e80d23434.1000x1000x1.jpg", "full_title": "The R.E.D.

"[Verse 1: The Game]\nSince Big ain't here, I'm about to do it for T'yanna\nAnd put roses on the grave of Kanye's mama\nThis for all the lost girls locked up in the pen\nAll the girls that hold it down, getting beat on by they man\nRespect women, I don't care if they a 2 or a 10\nWe don't beat on Kat Stacks, we just bring it to an end\nAnd we don't wanna see Nicki fighting Lil Kim\nThere\u2019s missing women out there, let\u2019s just focus on them\nThis song is dedicated to Natalie Holloway\nI feel for her daddy so I wrote this on father's day\nI know she gone, but she ain't far away\nI just had a daughter, pass me that cigar 'Ye\nI'm 'bout to tell a story, everybody parlay\nSit back listen while I kick it, the Compton Boulevard way\nMy daddy used to beat up on my mama all day\nSo I took my Chronic album and slept in the hallway\nI learned this the hard way, when police came our way\nMy daddy had his act on like it never happened (Broadway)\nPlus I was kinda scared to keep it real with you\nNow my mama good, nigga she ain't gotta deal with ya\nYou want some money nigga? I ain't get a deal with ya\nYou ain't saying nothing, you like a still picture\nYou better thank God you still breathing air\nCause you coulda went out like your boy Steve McNair\n\n[Hook]\nDon't make the good girls go bad, no\nDon't make the good girls go bad, no (I won't)\nIf you don't, you gon\u2019 really love us  (I said I won't)\nPlease don\u2019t use us, dooon\u2019t\n\n[Verse 2: Drake]\nGood evening, I'm in Chicago at the Elysian\nWith some girls that say they models but umm, I don't believe 'em\nWho's still getting tested?\nWhere's all the women that still remember who they slept with?\nWhere's all the girls too busy studying to make the guest list\nBut when you do go out, you still working what you was blessed with?\nDo it girl, I'll be the king to your Queen Latifah\nI love your ass like Milhouse loved Lisa\nI love your ass like the Ninja Turtles love pizza\nIronically enough, you something I want a piece of, you got it girl\nThis song remind me of Cat from Philly, a girl I used to love\nUntil she started acting silly, her heart's a little chilly\nShe a little too carefree in 10 years\nWho's paying for all that therapy? Umm, nigga not me, yeah\nI'm probably not the man you take me for\nBut I bet I could be if you make me yours\nMost of the shit I say is true\nWhen I\u2019m done with bad bitches, know I\u2019m coming straight to you good girl\n\n[Hook]\nDon't make the good girls go bad, no\nDon't make the good girls go bad, no\nIf you don't, you gon\u2019 really love us\nPlease don\u2019t use us, noo\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nDrizzy, I'm sitting here watching Basketball Wives\nLike, \"uhh, them is basketball wives?\"\nOnly cute one, Gloria, that's my nigga Matt Barnes' chick\nCan't swim in that poon fool, that's a crucial conflict\nNever sleep with the wife of niggas you eat with\nAnd never buy a chick a bag on the first date\nI pop a bottle with her on her birthday and tell her ass \"get on!\"\nDisrespect my chick, that type of shit'll get you spit on\nI don't hit on girls, I just hit on girls\nLike \"hey lil mama, come in Game and Drizzy's world\"\nGet busy girl, drink that ros\u00e9 'til you're dizzy girl\nShe walking around the club all lost, like where is he girl?\nHe on the top of the charts, next to Beyonce\nRight under Kanye, so let the Don spray\nThat\u2019s your girl? Nigga go on and make her cry\nSoon as you do, I'm pulling up in that Porsche like \"let's ride\"\n\n[Hook]\nDon't make the good girls go bad, no\nDon't make the good girls go bad, no\nIf you don't make the good girls go bad, no\nDon\u2019t make the good girls go bad, no\nIf you don't, you gon\u2019 really love us\nPlease don\u2019t use us, nooo\n\n[Verse 4: The Game]\nWord on the news stand, Alicia got herself a man\nAnd thats my nigga Swizzy, know you see Game and Drizzy\nSurrounded by them diamonds, I'mma cold mackin\nNigga its a cold climate, don\u2019t ask me where the crime went\nJust tell me where them dimes went\nSo I can get em fitted, let em beat a bridesmaid at the wedding for my niggas\nYeah I\u2019m married to the game\nAnd she married to my chain, watching Boyz n The Hood\nLets take a drive down memory lane"}}, {"title": "Ryda", "album": "NWA2016", "year": "2015-04-23", "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Game]\nMy ambitionz of a rida-da-da\nPut her in a YSL and that

Prada-da-da\nKeep the pistol on the side-ide-ide\nIn the Lamborghini smokin on that la-la-la\nShe got her hair in the wind, eyebrows on fleek\n'15 Bonnie & Clyde, Nicki and Meek\nI gave her keys to the condo, keys to the Jeep\nSay \"You jigglin, baby\", gave her the whole damn fleet\n\n[Verse 2: Dej Loaf]\nI always ride for you baby, and when shit get hard\nYou know I parade on the side of you, baby\nYeah, I met him in a dope gang, he had no name\nBack when you could get a half or a whole thang\n\n[Verse 3: Game]\nBack when we all ever needed was the cocaine\nBricks in the 600 why they call me Raw Game\n40 in the sti-dash, fuck around and be roadkill\nWith the top down feelin like\n\n[Hook: Game & Dej Loaf]\nMy ambitionz of a rida (rida, rida)\nMy ambitionz of a rida (rida, rida)\nMy ambitionz of a rida-da-da-da-da-da-da-da\nMy ambitionz of a rida-da-da-da-da-da-da-da\nMy ambitionz of a rida\n\n[Verse 4: Dej Loaf]\nNo whip now we in the Wraith, road rage\nKeep it gangsta pricy, one of them cold things\nWit ya, noooo, I ain't mad at ya\nGet out of line, probably throw a couple jabs at em\n\n[Verse 5: Game]\nHit Rodeo, probably throw a couple bags at ya\nIn my 2Pac voice - I ain't mad at ya\nTake the wheel, see if you can drive while I eat it\nMy fitted flew off, but I don't need it, tell me what I need\n\n[Verse 6: Dej Loaf]\nYou need a bitch that's gonna blast, spend cash with ya\nSame time fuck good, drop ass for you\nYeah, I ride it like rah-rah-rah-rah\nEat the pussy like la-la-laaaa\n\n[Verse 7: Game]\nWhy you gotta tell a nigga bid'ness?\nFine nigga Friday, you know a nigga live this\nHit you with the helicopter tongue\nThen fuck you til the helicopter come\n\n[Hook: Game & Dej Loaf]\nMy ambitionz of a rida (rida, rida)\nMy ambitionz of a rida (rida,

Impala (my ambitionz of a rida)\nSlidin down that pole for a dollar, nada\nTell that girl holla (my ambitionz of a rida)\nI done brought the thug life out her\nGot her stuffin bricks in that Prada (my

"[Produced by Kanye West]\n\n[Verse 1: The Game]\nI done been around the world, been around the block\nBeen around hoes that fucked Biggie and 'Pac\nLike Vida Guerra, ass took her to the top\nShe'll give you some brain, you let her throw up the Roc\nLet her put on your chain, she'll throw you some cot\nPicture that, like Meagan Good and Jamie Foxx\nHype said it's a wrap, she still on the set\nPuttin' oil on her legs like she Gloria Velez\nShe was Eye Candy in the XXL\nHopped off the page and on a skateboard with Pharrell\nI knew she wouldn't get far cause five hundred dollars\nCan't get you that far, how you get that far\nAnd all these new video bitches tryin to be Melyssa Ford\nBut they don't know Melyssa Ford drive a Honda Accord\nShe a video vixen, but behind closed doors\nShe do whatever it take to get to the Grammy Awards, ha ha\n\n[Hook: The Game + Pam Sawyer]\nYou wouldn't get far, fuckin' them rap stars\nYou know who you are, put your hands up ladies\nYou wouldn't get far, if you kept your legs closed\nIt would be just a waste of time\nBut you know, you wouldn't get far, fuckin' them rap stars\nYou know who you are, I wrote this song for you\nFor you baby, I'd find you, for you and you, for all y'all\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nPop quiz, how many topless, black foxes\nDid I have under my belt, like boxers\nNot to brag but, if it add up\nOne, two... nigga that's mad nuts\nGame you mad nuts, how you gon' call out all these\nBitches knowin' damn well they gon' call me\nThe only dream, of that ghetto prom queen\nWas to make it to the screen, maybe get seen\nMaybe get chose by a nigga from my team\nHead so good he don't ask for a pre... nup\nNow ask yourself this question, umm\nWould you be with Jay-Z if he wasn't C-E-O\nWould you be with F-A-B-O if he drove a Neo\nWould you ride with Ne-Yo, if he was in a Geo\nWell why the hell you think these bitches comin' at me fo'\nBut since they all fall in my Palm, I take a trio, yo\n\n[Hook: The Game]\nYou wouldn't get far, fuckin' them rap stars\nYou know who you are, put your hands up ladies\nYou wouldn't get far, if you kept your legs closed\nIt would be just a waste of time\nBut you know, you wouldn't get far, fuckin' them rap stars\nYou know who you are, I wrote this song for you\nFor you baby, I'd find you, for you and you, for all y'all\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nI done had my share of bitches with long hair\nShort do like Kelis or Halle in Boomerang, yeah\nI been around the block in the Bentley drop top\nIn Miami Beach when Lil' Kim was fuckin with Scott\nI got the scoop on Hoops, whatever the case\nShe'll let you spray in her face long as she Bathing Apes\nAnd ain't nobody tryin' to take Beyonce from Jay\nBut I know a bitch named Superhead he fucked back in the day\nThe things niggas do when pussy sittin' on they face\nStabbed Un in the stomach\nShe must have had a pussy like Wonder Woman\nOn that superhero shit\nFly as Gabrielle Union in the back of my six, fo'\nImpala, forget the double D's\nI put 'em right in your face like that model bitch Toccara\nAnd she ain't win the show but she ridin' in that Gallardo\nThat's why I fuck 'em today and forget 'em tomorrow\n\n[Hook: The Game]\nYou wouldn't get far, fuckin' them rap stars\nYou know who you are, put your hands up ladies\nYou wouldn't get far, if you kept your legs closed\nIt would be just a waste of time\nBut you know, you wouldn't get far, fuckin' them rap stars\nYou know who you are, I wrote this song for you\nFor you baby, I'd find you, for you and you, for all y'all\n\n[Outro - The Game]\nGod damn, you know what I'm sayin'\nI'm sittin' back watchin' Kanye video\nAnd I see the same bitch\nThat was in the homeboy Busta Rhymes video\nThen I flip the muh'fuckin channel\nCheckin' out my uncle Snoop Dogg video\nAnd I see the same bitch, that was in my video\nYou know what I'm sayin'\nAnd then y'knahmsayin, to make that even mo' fucked up\nI'm watchin Oprah cover Hurricane Katrina\nI see the same bitch on Oprah\nFloatin away on the hood of a Camry\nThat was in the nigga Lil Weezy video\nI mean damn, everywhere I look\nEverywhere I go, I see the same hoes\nDon't get mad, I'm only bein' real, yeah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2bc39719933dc6d4f8db7a83a6babbf3.400x400x1.jpg", "artist": "The Game", "raw": {"annotation_count": 18, "api_path": "/songs/1515",

block\nBeen around hoes that fucked Biggie and 'Pac\nLike Vida Guerra, ass took her to the top\nShe'll give you some brain, you let her throw up the Roc\nLet her put on your chain, she'll throw you some cot\nPicture that, like Meagan Good and Jamie Foxx\nHype said it's a wrap, she still on the set\nPuttin' oil on her legs like she Gloria Velez\nShe was Eye Candy in the XXL\nHopped off the page and on a skateboard with Pharrell\nI knew she wouldn't get far cause five hundred dollars\nCan't get you that far, how you get that far\nAnd all these new video bitches tryin to be Melyssa Ford\nBut they don't know Melyssa Ford drive a Honda Accord\nShe a video vixen, but behind closed doors\nShe do whatever it take to get to the Grammy Awards, ha ha\n\n[Hook: The Game + Pam Sawyer]\nYou wouldn't get far, fuckin' them rap stars\nYou know who you are, put your hands up ladies\nYou wouldn't get far, if you kept your legs closed\nIt would be just a waste of time\nBut you know, you wouldn't get far, fuckin' them rap stars\nYou know who you are, I wrote this song for you\nFor you baby, I'd find you, for you and you, for all y'all\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nPop quiz, how many topless, black foxes\nDid I have under my belt, like boxers\nNot to brag but, if it add up\nOne, two... nigga that's mad nuts\nGame you mad nuts, how you gon' call out all these\nBitches knowin' damn well they gon' call me\nThe only dream, of that ghetto prom queen\nWas to make it to the screen, maybe get seen\nMaybe get chose by a nigga from my team\nHead so good he don't ask for a pre... nup\nNow ask yourself this question, umm\nWould you be with Jay-Z if he wasn't C-E-O\nWould you be with F-A-B-O if he drove a Neo\nWould you ride with Ne-Yo, if he was in a Geo\nWell why the hell you think these bitches comin' at me fo'\nBut since they all fall in my Palm, I take a trio, yo\n\n[Hook: The Game]\nYou wouldn't get far, fuckin' them rap stars\nYou know who you are, put your hands up ladies\nYou wouldn't get far, if you kept your legs closed\nIt would be just a waste of time\nBut you know, you wouldn't get far, fuckin' them rap stars\nYou know who you are, I wrote this song for you\nFor you baby, I'd find you, for you and you, for all y'all\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nI done had my share of bitches with long hair\nShort do like Kelis or Halle in Boomerang, yeah\nI been around the block in the Bentley drop top\nIn Miami Beach when Lil' Kim was fuckin with Scott\nI got the scoop on Hoops, whatever the case\nShe'll let you spray in her face long as she Bathing Apes\nAnd ain't nobody tryin' to take Beyonce from Jay\nBut I know a bitch named Superhead he fucked back in the day\nThe things niggas do when pussy sittin' on they face\nStabbed Un in the stomach\nShe must have had a pussy like Wonder Woman\nOn that superhero shit\nFly as Gabrielle Union in the back of my six, fo'\nImpala, forget the double D's\nI put 'em right in your face like that model bitch Toccara\nAnd she ain't win the show but she ridin' in that Gallardo\nThat's why I fuck 'em today and forget 'em tomorrow\n\n[Hook: The Game]\nYou wouldn't get far, fuckin' them rap stars\nYou know who you are, put your hands up ladies\nYou wouldn't get far, if you kept your legs closed\nIt would be just a waste of time\nBut you know, you wouldn't get far, fuckin' them rap stars\nYou know who you are, I wrote this song for you\nFor you baby, I'd find you, for you and you, for all y'all\n\n[Outro - The Game]\nGod damn, you know what I'm sayin'\nI'm sittin' back watchin' Kanye video\nAnd I see the same bitch\nThat was in the homeboy Busta Rhymes video\nThen I flip the muh'fuckin channel\nCheckin' out my uncle Snoop Dogg video\nAnd I see the same bitch, that was in my video\nYou know what I'm sayin'\nAnd then y'knahmsayin, to make that even mo' fucked up\nI'm watchin Oprah cover Hurricane Katrina\nI see the same bitch on Oprah\nFloatin away on the hood of a Camry\nThat was in the nigga Lil Weezy video\nI mean damn, everywhere I look\nEverywhere I go, I see the same hoes\nDon't get mad, I'm only bein' real, yeah"}}, {"title": "T.H.O.T.", "album": null, "year": "2014-02-13", "lyrics": "[Hook:

Ricans, white boys, Jamaicans\nLatin Kings, Disciples, Vice Lords, Haitians\nAll these motherfuckers been patiently waitin'\nSince the West coast fell off, the streets been watchin'\nThe West coast never fell off, I was asleep in Compton\nAftermath been here, the beats been knockin'\nNate Dogg doin' his thing, DPG still poppin'\nI got California Love, fuckin' bitches to that 'Pac shit\nAnd Westside Connection, been had it locked bitch\nI'm in the rearview, my guns is cockin'\nI put red dots on that nigga head like Rodman\nAll Stars, fat laces, gun charge, court cases\nFought that, not guilty, I'm back, niggas hate me\nBeen there, done that, sold crack, got jacked\nGot shot, came back, jumped on Dre's back\nPayback, homey I'm bringin' C.A. back\nAnd I don't do button up shirts or drive Maybachs\nAll you old record labels tryin' to advance\nAftermath bitch, take it like a muh'fuckin' man\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent]\nIf you take a look in my eyes\nYou see I'll be a gangsta till I die\nThat California chronic got me so high\nGame tell 'em where you from, nigga Westside\nIf you take a look in my eyes\nYou see I'll be a gangsta till I die\nThat California chronic got me so high\nGame tell 'em where you from, nigga Westside\n\n[Verse 2: The Game]\nI'm lowridin' homey, six trey Impala\nGold D's spinnin', chrome hydraulics\nRun up on my lo-lo, you stop breathin'\nHollow tips make niggas disappear like Houdini\nGang bangin' is real, homey I'm living proof\nLike Snoop Dogg, C-walkin' on top of the devil's roof\nRap critics wanna converse about this and that\nCause red strings in his Converse, and this a Dre track\nKeep jibbin' and jabbin', I pull the .38\nMagnum and get to clickin' and clackin', your homies wanna know\nWhat happened come to Compton see Thriller like Mike Jackson\nI might be Spike Lee of this gun clappin'\nPrior to rappin', I was drug traffickin'\nIn the dope spot playin' John Madden\nHomey I ain't braggin', I took five\nYou wanna die, run up on that black 745\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent]\nIf you take a look in my eyes\nYou see I'll be a gangsta till I die\nThat California chronic got me so high\nGame tell 'em where you from, nigga Westside\nIf you take a look in my eyes\nYou see I'll be a gangsta till I die\nThat California chronic got me so high\nGame tell 'em where you from, nigga Westside\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nNew York, New York, big city of dreams\nI got my L.A. Dodger fitted on, I'm doin' my thing\nGot me fuckin' with G-Unit, you know the drama that bring\nI got niggas in Westside Compton and Southside Queens\nAnd Buck told me in Cashville I'm good when I come through\nSo I ain't gotta tuck in my chain like DJ Pooh\nI'm gangsta - more like Deebo when he was Zeus\nPlay Bishop, I paint that picture, now who got the Juice?\nYou niggas is Nutso, I take off your roof\nLeave yo' ass stretched out like a Cadillac coupe\nGod gotta let me in heaven, all the shit I've been through\nI was a O.G. in the hood before I turned twenty-two\nHomey I let the .38 special ripped through that vest\nAnd I don't contemplate whether or not he left his shit on the dresser\nGot Compton on my back, I'm startin' to feel the pressure\nI'm lyrically Kool G. Rap on these Dre records\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent]\nIf you take a look in my eyes\nYou see I'll be a gangsta till I die\nThat California chronic got me so high\nGame tell 'em where you from, nigga Westside\nIf you take a look in my eyes\nYou see I'll be a gangsta till I die\nThat California chronic got me so high\nGame tell 'em where you from, nigga Westside (nigga Westside)"}}, {"title": "Scared Now", "album": "Jesus Piece", "year": "2012-12-11", "lyrics": "[Hook]\nWho the fuck scared now?\nLook who the fuck dead now\nHad to hit him with the shotty nigga\nAnother dead fucking body nigga\nGangsters, this is how we roll\nJesus Piece, and it's solid gold\nVersace polo and a pound of dro\nHop in that Ghost, and it's adios\nWho the fuck scared now?\nWho the fuck scared now?\n\n[Verse 1]\nChased that nigga down, put him on worldstar\nBitch nigga got away, in his girl car\nPut that pussy on the net like a pornstar\nAnother weenie with bread, he a corndog\nPut 3 holes in his head, like a bowling ball\nI'm out the gutter switching lanes in a stolen car\nFuck the feds, cause a nigga got a murder charge\nFuck it though, got the cover of the murder dog\nI dress up like the pizza man, load the desert eagle and\nI don't just hit ya team, I wet the whole bleachers, damn\nSpecialize in the murder game\nDocumentary shit, back to Hurricane\nNow tell a nigga\n\n[Hook]\nWho the fuck scared now?\nLook who the fuck dead now\nHad to hit him with the shotty nigga\nAnother dead fucking body nigga\nGangsters, this is how we roll\nJesus Piece, and it's solid gold\nVersace polo and a pound of dro\nHop in that Ghost, and it's adios\nWho the fuck scared now?\nWho the fuck scared now?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm the most feared rap nigga\nLike a Just Blaze beat, i'll clap niggas\nThis ain't a Just Blaze beat, this ain't wrapped nigga\nVoletta Wallace lost her son to a gat nigga\nWhat if I told y'all I know who killed Biggie dog?\nI ain't no snitch but if I did it ain't no biggie dog\nCause that's Biggie dog\nAll that's coming out the mouth of the nigga you used to know as being 50's dog\nBut I got tired of being 50's dog\nHad to break my chain and cut that nigga 50 off\nWhole team celebrating, label on my dick hard\nInterscope asking, would I take 50's call?\n\"Hello?

your little flow\nThen he made you temporary replacement for Yayo\nYou a bitch, and that's hard to swallow\nAnd you got robbed for your spinning G-Unit chain in Chicago\nI call my nigga Jojo to get it back\nHe had the shit in his hands, and you ain't had the ten stacks\nPicture that, I thought we was G-Unit\nThen you ran and told 50 that I did that shit\nAsk C-Murder, the boy ain't hard to find\nI told Monica when I catch him, the boy is mine\nTake one shot of Brandy and pop\nWatch his panties drop, when I run inside the Candy Shop\nFuck you, 50, Banks, Yayo, and the cops\nAnd Olivia, I mean for a man she hot\nNow I'm running out of breath, like I just beatboxed\nGot twenty bars to go, lay it down like sheet rock\nDon't worry about the flow, the boy know he hot\nHurricanes in store November, nigga fuck Reeboks\nI'm fly like a hummingbird on a tree top\nThe new Hov, the new B.I.G., the new Pac, I need three spots\n280 in, ain't no getting me back\nI'm yelling fuck the world, on my victory lap\nRemember first it was Buddens, then it was Bleek\nNow it's whoever motherfucker, yeah, who want beef?\nNow whenever motherfucker, who wanna see me?\nIn the coffin, body exhausted, resting in peace\nYou don't want war nigga, you want peace\nSo give 'em the piece, capisce, let 'em rest in peace\nFrom West to East the flow is outdatable, irreplaceable\nLyrical homicide, hell is hot, I'm boxing with Satan\nAnd I slipped 'em the ace, you cannot replace 'em\nIf Eazy ever decide to return, I remain Jayceon\nA king in the making, and the throne is for the taking\nSo I climb the mountain top and put my stake in\nGot the weight of the world on my shoulder\nNot a nigga nor a hoodrat bitch can stop me from taking it over\nThis is crack music, go get the baking soda\n300 Bars and Runnin', nigga the wait is over\nI'm gone", "image": "https://images.genius.com/94aac16d9845daeefdcaedcb5eeb289b.360x360x1.jpg", "artist": "The Game", "raw": {"annotation_count": 107, "api_path":

closer\nBefore you call this a diss, and you make Hova pissed\nWhy would I wanna do that? When I'm just the new cat\nThat was taught if a nigga take shots to shoot back\nDefending his yard, yeah standing his ground\nI'm saying if you gonna retire, then hand me the crown\nNah, let Bleek do it, then throw him a concert in Madison Square\nWatch everybody sleep through it\nWe can go bar for bar, I'll let the lines speak to 'em\nWhat they say? Bleek is over, let Chris and Neef do it\nThey say the wrong thing, I'mma smack 'em silly\nWhat you thought?

Beef is when I murk you on the spot\nLabels signing anything, still searching for they Pac\nI put purple on the block, so I don't feel threatened\nWhen Ludacris say he coming for the number one spot\nAsk 50, it get lonely on top, you can hate me\nOr love me, but now the cops the only homies he got\nWhen it's beef we eat, we win, but we ain't lonely, we pop\nYou sell records but a G-g-g-U-not\nActing big on the radio, to me you not\nYou can ask Mister Cee who hot\nTony Yayo I bet 10 G's you flop\nRun up on that new 300 C you got\nStop hoping I fall, hope the bleeding stop\nAnd I hope you blackout before you see the cops\nI ain't High Top from Colors, I'm from Cedar Block\nSo I got my high tops that make your breathing stop\nI'm a gangsta slash rapper, check your CD shop\nI'm like Elvis in there, they can't believe you dropped\nNow I'm moving on up to George and Weezy's spot\nI picked up where my homeboy Eazy stopped\nI saw the west coast, put the shit on my back\nSprayed Aftermath on it, then loosened the strap\nIt get hot in here, let Lucifer rap\nBring hell to niggas when Dre producing a track\nTake it to the streets, put the duece-duece to your hat\nThen call up the pigs, tell them the rooster's back\nCall Jadakiss, tell him that duke is back\nI'm still by your side, no matter who comes strapped\nFuck Lloyd Banks, it ain't about who can rap\nIt's about when the Ruger clap, is rufus back\nI see what you thinkin', you want me to die, is that so?\nNow you left leaning back, thanks to Fat Joe\nWe got reservations in heaven, you ready?

resting in peace\nYou don't want war nigga, you want peace\nSo give 'em the piece, capisce, let 'em rest in peace\nFrom West to East the flow is outdatable, irreplaceable\nLyrical homicide, hell is hot, I'm boxing with Satan\nAnd I slipped 'em the ace, you cannot replace 'em\nIf Eazy ever decide to return, I remain Jayceon\nA king in the making, and the throne is for the taking\nSo I climb the mountain top and put my stake in\nGot the weight of the world on my shoulder\nNot a nigga nor a hoodrat bitch can stop me from taking it over\nThis is crack music, go get the baking soda\n300 Bars and

we got, we all we got\nGod ain't put us on the Earth to get murdered, it's murder\nGod ain't put us on the Earth to get murdered, it's murder\nDon't point your weapons at me\n\n[Verse 1: Game]\nSeen the pictures, feel the pain, scandalous how they murder son\nTired of them killing us, I'm on my way to Ferguson\nTalked to TIP, I talked to Diddy, them my brothers walking with me\nMothers crying \"Stop the riots\", we ain't got to chalk the city\nI seen Cole out there, felt I should go out there\nThey left that boy for hours in the cold out there\nThey killin' teens, they killin' dreams (It's murder)\n\n[Verse 2: Diddy]\nYo, come on we gotta stick together, we all we got\nPolice taking shots and I ain't talkin' bout Ciroc\nI'm talking bout Emmett Till, I'm talking bout Ezell Ford\nI'm talking bout Sean Bell, they never go to jail for\nTrayvon over Skittles, Mike Brown Cigarillos\nHistory keeps repeating itself, like a Biggie instrumental\nAmerica's a glass house and my revenge is

dream\nBut they ain't respecting Jesse up out here\nAnd they don't really respect Obama out here\nLights out, go dark - it's like a nightmare\nHow the fuck you play the game, but they ain't playing fair\nIt's going down, Armageddon right here\nRight now, not on TV but right here\nPut your flags in the air if you don't really care (wave it)\nWe need justice yeah, we need justice here\n\n[Verse 9: Curren$y]\nI heard he surrendered but we all saw how they did him\nTelevision broadcasts, a confused country\nI'm a resident of a nation that don't want me\nWhat's done is done the town erupts in fury\nAnd I'm already hearing bout this lopsided jury\nThree faces like his, the rest another story\nA lot of motherfuckers need to act more worried\n\n[Verse 10: Problem]\nThe revolution has been televised\nIf I sit here and do don't do nothing, homie, that's genocide\nFuck that, we have arrived\nAnd who cares who ain't on our side cause we on our own\nHow do you preach peace to a family that just lost they own?\nMy brodie Game just banged my line like \"We gotta do something\"\nAll that marching and that peace ain't gonna fucking do nothing\nFuck it, my moms, sorry I'm ready to rage\nThe police done let the animals out of the cage\nOh lord it's\n\n[Hook: Game's daughter]\nTime to take a stand and save our future\nLike we all got shot, we all got shot\nThrowing up our hands don't let them shoot us\nCause we all we got, we all we got\nGod ain't put us on the Earth to get murdered, it's murder\nGod ain't put us on the Earth to get murdered, it's murder\nDon't point your weapons at me\n\n[Outro: Diddy]\nStand up", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/f1da79da432543011a6fa8895620411a.500x500x1.jpg", "artist": "The Game", "raw": {"annotation_count": 78, "api_path":

fire\nAs we keep our hands up high and scream for justice\nFerguson, rest in peace Mike Brown\nAnd all the young soldiers out there\nGod help us\n\n[Hook: TGT]\nTime to take a stand and save our future\nLike we all got shot, we all got shot\nThrowing up our hands don't let them shoot us\nCause we all we got, we all we got\nGod ain't put us on the Earth to get murdered, it's murder\nGod ain't put us on the Earth to get murdered, it's murder\nDon't point your weapons at me\n\n[Verse 1: Game]\nSeen the pictures, feel the pain, scandalous how they murder son\nTired of them killing us, I'm on my way to Ferguson\nTalked to TIP, I talked to Diddy, them my brothers walking with me\nMothers crying \"Stop the riots\", we ain't got to chalk the city\nI seen Cole out there, felt I should go out there\nThey left that boy for hours in the cold out there\nThey killin' teens, they killin' dreams (It's murder)\n\n[Verse 2: Diddy]\nYo, come on we gotta stick together, we all we got\nPolice taking shots and I ain't talkin' bout Ciroc\nI'm talking bout Emmett Till, I'm talking bout Ezell Ford\nI'm talking bout Sean Bell, they never go to jail for\nTrayvon over Skittles, Mike Brown Cigarillos\nHistory keeps repeating itself, like a Biggie instrumental\nAmerica's a glass house and my revenge is mental\nRather use my brain than throw a cocktail through a window\n\n[Verse 3: Rick Ross]\nI got the keys to the city still we left in the cold\nHands in the sky, still was left in the road\nRibbon in the sky, Michael Brown, another soul\nStole by the system, black men we pay the toll\nThe price is your life, Uncle Sam want a slice\nBlack dress code now we looting in the night\nNow we throwing Molotovs in this holocaust\nAnd I know they hate to hear me screaming, 'I'm a Boss!'\n\n[Hook: TGT]\nTime to take a stand and save our future\nLike we all got shot, we all got shot\nThrowing up our hands don't let them shoot us\nCause we all we got, we all we got\nGod ain't put us on the Earth to get murdered, it's murder\nGod ain't put us on the Earth to get murdered, it's murder\nDon't point your weapons at me\n\n[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]\nTired of the okie-dokie, lying you Pinocchio\nDriving while black, tell me, where am I supposed to go?\nGun shots hit the car, now I got the holy ghost\nIf excessive force was a drug, then they overdosed\nGot us tryna protest, it's a slow process\nHeard it's a lotta rotten eggs in the crow's nest\nPeople praying on they feet, police holding on they heat\nTurned on the news and seen a tank rolling down the street\n\n[Verse 5: Fabolous]\nYeah, I seen a lot of ice water tossed and I know it's for a cause\nMy only question is, what we doing for the loss\nOf Mike Brown?\nCause right now, I challenge you to use your talents to\nSpeak up, and don't you ever let em silence you\nCause action speaks louder than words, that's what I heard\nShot down with his hands up, that's what occurred\nMan that sound absurd\nMatter fact to me that sound like murder\nWe want justice\n\n[Verse 6: Yo Gotti]\nAy yo Game, I had a crib out there\nI used to live out there\nSo I know how niggas feel out there\nPeople stressing, protesting, unity is a blessing\nSo it's time we come together\nUse our voice as a weapon\nI am Michael Brown, cause I stand for what he stand for\nNews say we're looting\nPaint pictures like we some animals\nOn my NWA CMG\nHoll'in' \"Rest in peace Eazy and fuck the police\"\n\n[Verse 7: Wale]\nHeard another brother slain up in St. Louis\nSure the mother feel the pain, but what you famous doing\nI\u2019m sure the general population trying to be more active\nBut when the light finally catches you, you're ice challenged\nOkay, and I support the ALS just like the rest of them\nBut you have yet to pay your debt\nSo you just flexing then\nCause everybody care for a minute, then stop\nPeople only there for a minute, then stop\nAnd what's the point of giving if you ain't giving your all\nWe never getting ahead, might as well give up your heart\n\n[Bridge: TGT; Swizz Beatz in brackets]\nWhere does it end?\nI got my hands up, what else am I supposed to do?\n(Rest in peace to Mike Brown)\nWhere does it end?\n(And all the other fallen soldiers)\nTell me, where's the love for everything we're going through?\n(That will not be on the news or televised, ah)\nMercy, mercy, mercy, mercy me\nHope that God can save us\nMercy, mercy, mercy, mercy me\n(As we lead in peace)\n\n[Verse 8: Swizz Beatz]\nMartin Luther King had a dream\nBut they ain't respecting Jesse up out here\nAnd they don't really respect Obama out here\nLights out, go dark - it's like a nightmare\nHow the fuck you play the game, but they ain't playing fair\nIt's going down, Armageddon right here\nRight now, not on TV but right here\nPut your flags in the air if you don't really care (wave it)\nWe need justice yeah, we need justice here\n\n[Verse 9: Curren$y]\nI heard he surrendered but we all saw how they did him\nTelevision broadcasts, a confused country\nI'm a resident of a nation that don't want me\nWhat's done is done the town erupts in fury\nAnd I'm already hearing bout this lopsided jury\nThree faces like his, the rest another story\nA lot of motherfuckers need to act more worried\n\n[Verse 10: Problem]\nThe revolution has been televised\nIf I sit here and do don't do nothing, homie, that's genocide\nFuck that, we have arrived\nAnd who cares who ain't on our side cause we on our own\nHow do you preach peace to a family that just lost they own?\nMy brodie Game just banged my line like \"We gotta do something\"\nAll that marching and that peace ain't gonna fucking do nothing\nFuck it, my moms, sorry I'm ready to rage\nThe police done let the animals out of the cage\nOh lord it's\n\n[Hook: Game's daughter]\nTime to take a stand and save our future\nLike we all got shot, we all got shot\nThrowing up our hands don't let them shoot us\nCause we all we got, we all we got\nGod ain't put us on the Earth to get murdered, it's murder\nGod ain't put us on the Earth to get murdered, it's murder\nDon't point your weapons at me\n\n[Outro: Diddy]\nStand up"}}, {"title": "Start From

me?\nOhh man, shit\nThe story of my life\n\n[Verse 1: The Game]\nIf I could start from scratch, I wouldn't change shit\nSame red bandana, same four-fifth\nSame G-wagon, same hoodrat bitch\nWorkers in the kitchen cookin' up my shit\nSame telephone booth, same connect\nThat mean the same hollow tips breakin' up in my chest\nSame bloody t-shirt, same address\nSame Dogg Food album banging in my tape deck\nHomie, if I can make '94 today\nI'd tell Eazy and Dre to bring back N.W.A\nI would've told 'Pac not to stomp out Orlando\nTold Puffy and Big about the Rampart scandal\nI got too many dead homies, fuck a rap career\nI'd give anything in the world to bring back my nigga Tear\nSeem like we was just in Magic City yesterday\nIf I could bring back my homeboy Charles, he would say\n\n[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]\nIf I could start my life from scratch\nIf I could take away the pain of the past\nIf I had another chance, I would do just that\nI'd give anything just to go right back\n\n[Verse 2: The Game]\nHomey if I could rewind the hands of time\nI would've cut off the PS2 at 12:49\nNigga I'm a gangster, I stay on my grind\nWho knew 11 minutes later I'd get shot with my own 9\nI was two beeps away from a flatline\nWhen you a Bad Boy niggas don't wanna see you Shyne\nDre said it's my turn, he call it Game time\n23 inch Lexani's, bitches call 'em LeBrons\nI'd give my own life if I could change God's mind\nBring Baby Loony back at the drop of a dime\nHe let off a whole 'K, got shot one time\nThat was a cool nigga, I wish he had nine lives\nMy brother Jevon died cause he chased the cat\nIt's a dog eat dog world, Jesus please holler back\nI got a confession to make, it's called payback\nIf you don't wanna listen, show me where Pastor Ma$e at\n\n[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]\nIf I could start my life from scratch\nIf I could take away the pain of the past\nIf I had another chance, I would do just that\nI'd give anything just to go right back\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nI would've told Big Will they raid every Tuesday and Thursday\nWhen pigeons in your coupe, you gotta watch where your birds lay\nWould've told V to stay sober\nWhen niggas beg for mercy, that mean the beef is over\nTold Meeks take the Porsche back, drive the Rover\nTold Slim hit reverse on that hardtop Nova\nI would've changed a couple of lines when I wrote \"Soldier\"\nSo I wouldn't have to live lookin' over my shoulder\nMy life is like a Impala, ridin' three-wheel motion\nI been front to back, side to side\nLevel my six-four frame out, keep on rollin'\nKeep your family far away and your enemies closer\nPicture this, The Source sucking Benzino's dick\nTryin' to be the big fish in the pond, you know how them piranhas get\nYou dead when that green line go flat\nIf you could start your life from scratch, you couldn't change that\n\n[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]\nIf I could start my life from scratch\nIf I could take away the pain of the past\nIf I had another chance, I would do just that\nI'd give anything just to go right back"}}, {"title": "400 Bars", "album": "The Red Room ", "year": "2010-04-15", "lyrics": "It's been a long time, get re-acquainted with the world famous\nYou know how on

bitches, I'm yours\nFuck all these bitches, I'm yours\nOnly thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas\nOnly thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas\nOnly thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas\nOnly thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas\nFuck all these bitches, I'm yours\nFuck all these bitches, I'm yours\n\n[Outro: Sonya\u00e8 Elise (Future)]\nOooh-oooh-oooh\nFuck these other bitches I just\nOooh-oooh-oooh\nFuck with them when issues begin\nOooh-oooh-oooh\nI be with my niggas, when I'm\nOooh-oooh-oooh\nSay I'm with my niggas, I just\nOooh-oooh-oooh\nDon't you know there's no better time than when I'm with you?\nBut I can't control these temptations when a nigga not with you\nYou wanna be done with me, but your heart won't let it\nStanding at the front door but you just can't exit\nYou wanna be with me\nYou wanna be with me\nYou wanna be with me, with me, with me, with me\nMe, me, me, me\nYou wanna be with me, with me, with me, with me\nMe, me, me, me\nMe, me, me, me\n(Fuck all these bitches, I'm yours\nOnly thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas\nOnly thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas)", "image":

you gonna ride for me like I ride for you?\nI speak your name and it's royalty\nYou see the stress and my loyalty\nYou gotta be there for me through the casualties\nYou see my trials and my tribulations\nYou can tell them demons tryna capture me\nOnly thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas\nI know these niggas gon' ride, yeah, squeeze triggers\nYou gotta put in some time for this\nAlmost lost my mind for this\nFuck all that crying lil bitch\nNiggas round my way, they dying for this\n\n[Chorus: Future]\nFuck all these bitches, I'm yours\nFuck all these bitches, I'm yours\nOnly thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas\nOnly thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas\nOnly thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas\nOnly thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas\nFuck all these bitches, I'm yours\nFuck all these bitches, I'm yours\n\n[Verse 2: The Game]\nYou already know me, know how I get down\nKnow I'm with the shit when I pull up\nAny nigga ever disrespected you from the beginning\nI put the chrome to his neck like a pull up\nYou know a nigga bang Cedar block\nYou was bool with it, wasn't you?\nTalkin' 'bout when a nigga gonna leave the block alone\nBut you never say this shit when I'm fucking you\nWe was the Huxtables, everything was perfect\nEverything was working\nWe had some beautiful kids together\nHad a nigga feeling like everything was worth it\nCloset full of Birkins\nHow you make a nigga spend a million dollars on purses?\nThen have an attitude\nLike you in the studio helping a nigga write verses\nHad a nigga focused on the future, now a nigga feeling like Future\nWe both dealing with a new nigga 'round our kids\nAnd we ain't kill 'em yet, nigga, I salute you\nAnd I still bang like I used to, red Impala, gold things like I used to\nPick up my kids, they don't see none of that\nBut when I'm back in the hood I'm yelling soo woo!\nAnd it was all good just a week ago\nShit, we was Nicki and Meek a week ago\nGave you everything, the watch, the house, the cards\nTatted your passport, and now you wanna see me low\nWanna take my pussy, give it to the next nigga free\nOne thing about the next nigga\nHe just the next nigga, he can never be me\nI'm coming to get my kids and they momma like\n\n[Chorus: Future]\nFuck all these bitches, I'm yours\nFuck all these bitches, I'm yours\nOnly thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas\nOnly thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas\nOnly thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas\nOnly thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas\nFuck all these bitches, I'm yours\nFuck all these bitches, I'm yours\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nCompton ain't the same\nWhere all these bitch niggas come from?\nCan\u2019t even take a fade or ride through the hood\nWithout niggas hands out like they want some\nBut where you at when I need you?\nSee most of these niggas see through\nYou throw up a P, I throw up a P too\nYou pulling out heat, I draw the heat too\nCompton made me like this, nigga\nFuck all these bitches, get money and die\nHundred niggas in my section, hundred Rollies in the sky\nThere's a hundred little niggas that will bang on a nigga\nPut the flame on a nigga, take chains from a nigga\nThat will go BG, Turk and Wayne on a nigga\nWhen the club get cloudy let it rain on a nigga\nWe are with the shit, let us redefine lit\nThat\u2019s in the club smoking on extendos, extendo with the clip\nStanding on the couch like wah\nBackwood hanging out my mouth like wah\nWho the fuck want a problem?\nOnce you\u2019re shot, leave a nigga dead on an island\nCreep out the back door with my side bitch, aye\n\n[Chorus: Future]\nFuck all these bitches, I'm yours\nFuck all these bitches, I'm yours\nOnly thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas\nOnly thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas\nOnly thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas\nOnly thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas\nFuck all these bitches, I'm yours\nFuck all these bitches, I'm yours\n\n[Outro: Sonya\u00e8 Elise (Future)]\nOooh-oooh-oooh\nFuck these other bitches I just\nOooh-oooh-oooh\nFuck with them when issues begin\nOooh-oooh-oooh\nI be with my niggas, when I'm\nOooh-oooh-oooh\nSay I'm with my niggas, I just\nOooh-oooh-oooh\nDon't you know there's no better time than when I'm with you?\nBut I can't control these temptations when a nigga not with you\nYou wanna be done with me, but your heart won't let it\nStanding at the front door but you just can't exit\nYou wanna be with me\nYou wanna be with me\nYou wanna be with me, with me, with me, with me\nMe, me, me, me\nYou wanna be with me, with me, with me, with me\nMe, me, me, me\nMe, me, me, me\n(Fuck all these bitches, I'm yours\nOnly thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas\nOnly thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas)"}}, {"title": "Can't Get Right", "album": "Jesus Piece", "year": "2012-12-11", "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Game]\nI bumped \"Ether,\" bumped \"Takeover\"\nSeein' Jay and Nas on stage was hip-hop's makeover\nAnd that very day you knew niggas was born\nTyler, The Creators, Drake, J. Coles, and Big Seans\nTime for the world to pay homage\nBow to the rap Gods or them K's vomit\nFuck you know about Dipset you little dipshit\nIf you ain't fuck, then you ain't get your dick wet\nI see your little chain\nI see your little dreads, tryin' to be a Lil Wayne, shit\nI used to wanna be a little Hov\nStarted with a little rock, got me a little stove\nMade a little money, bought me a little Rov'\nPaid cash money like I was from Hollygrove\nSold ten mill, everybody know my name now\nThinkin' back, it's a motherfuckin' shame how\nBiggie got killed and Pac got murked\nSometimes I gotta step in the church, cause I ain't tryin' to go to hell\nAs the blood spills from my pen\nIt's time to confess my sins, cause I ain't tryin' to go to hell\nI smoke weed, pop pills, but I'm thinkin' it's time for me to chill\nCause I ain't tryin' to go to hell\nI'm tryin' to get some head tonight, have a stripper in my bed tonight\nBut I ain't tryin' to go to hell\n\n[Chorus: K. Roosevelt]\nFather forgive me, cause I ain't perfect\nNo, no no no\nWhy is everything wrong?\nOh I can't get it right, I always try to get it right\n\n[Verse 2: Game]\nDre promised me records, I never got 'em\nThat's why I had nightmares that a nigga shot him\nFor all my albums missed records\nFelt he shitted on me for Kendrick, recorded diss records\nAnd Kendrick, my nigga, put him on his first mixtape\nI pop champagne when I heard he was with Dre\nAnd I'm tellin' y'all this true story cause I'm real\nDre, first time, hearing 'bout it, wonder how he feel\nCause I feel like shit severin' the relationship\nThe only doctor I knew to make all of his patients rich\nSnoop, Pac, Em, 50, me, K. Dot, watch us do a 360\nPlus The Documentary saved me from penitentiaries\nI ain't trippin', niggas been disloyal for centuries\nFinally got the crown, this motherfucker meant for me\nFunny how you do your top 5's and don't mention me\nFuck 'em all\n\n[Chorus: K. Roosevelt]\nFather forgive me, cause I ain't perfect\nNo, no no no\nWhy is everything wrong?\nOh I can't get it right, I always try to get it right\n\n\n[Break: K. Roosevelt]\nSee I been spendin' these late nights\nOn girls I never see again\nConstantly intoxicated\nOnly God could save me, yeah\nWith 'em by the sunrise\nOne day everyone dies\nThat's the way the story goes\nBut now, I can't feel my heart\nBut I just keep ridin', ridin'\nFeel so numb, numb, oh yeah\n\n[Chorus: K. Roosevelt]\nFather forgive me, cause I ain't perfect\nNo, no no no\nWhy is everything wrong?\nOh I can't get it right, I always try to get it right", "image":

Coles, and Big Seans\nTime for the world to pay homage\nBow to the rap Gods or them K's vomit\nFuck you know about Dipset you little dipshit\nIf you ain't fuck, then you ain't get your dick wet\nI see your little chain\nI see your little dreads, tryin' to be a Lil Wayne, shit\nI used to wanna be a little Hov\nStarted with a little rock, got me a little stove\nMade a little money, bought me a little Rov'\nPaid cash money like I was from Hollygrove\nSold ten mill, everybody know my name now\nThinkin' back, it's a motherfuckin' shame how\nBiggie got killed and Pac got murked\nSometimes I gotta step in the church, cause I ain't tryin' to go to hell\nAs the blood spills from my pen\nIt's time to confess my sins, cause I ain't tryin' to go to hell\nI smoke weed, pop pills, but I'm thinkin' it's time for me to chill\nCause I ain't tryin' to go to hell\nI'm tryin' to get some head tonight, have a stripper in my bed tonight\nBut I ain't tryin' to go to hell\n\n[Chorus: K. Roosevelt]\nFather forgive me, cause I ain't perfect\nNo, no no no\nWhy is everything wrong?\nOh I can't get it right, I always try to get it right\n\n[Verse 2: Game]\nDre promised me records, I never got 'em\nThat's why I had nightmares that a nigga shot him\nFor all my albums missed records\nFelt he shitted on me for Kendrick, recorded diss records\nAnd Kendrick, my nigga, put him on his first mixtape\nI pop champagne when I heard he was with Dre\nAnd I'm tellin' y'all this true story cause I'm real\nDre, first time, hearing 'bout it, wonder how he feel\nCause I feel like shit severin' the relationship\nThe only doctor I knew to make all of his patients rich\nSnoop, Pac, Em, 50, me, K. Dot, watch us do a 360\nPlus The Documentary saved me from penitentiaries\nI ain't trippin', niggas been disloyal for centuries\nFinally got the crown, this motherfucker meant for me\nFunny how you do your top 5's and don't mention me\nFuck 'em all\n\n[Chorus: K. Roosevelt]\nFather forgive me, cause I ain't perfect\nNo, no no no\nWhy is everything wrong?\nOh I can't get it right, I always try to get it right\n\n\n[Break: K. Roosevelt]\nSee I been spendin' these late nights\nOn girls I never see again\nConstantly intoxicated\nOnly God could save me, yeah\nWith 'em by the sunrise\nOne day everyone dies\nThat's the way the story goes\nBut now, I can't feel my heart\nBut I just keep ridin', ridin'\nFeel so numb, numb, oh yeah\n\n[Chorus: K.

Madonna\nAngels lined up in my honor, your honor\nName Me King\nName Me King\nI took the crown, infiltrated their fortress\nKidnap the queen, rode away on white horses\nName Me King\nName Me King\n\n[Verse 1: Game]\nBrick by brick I built my fortress\nMy queen beautiful, Lamborghini is gorgeous\nPhantom in the courtyard, 400 horses\nGrowl made the towers fall, 911 Porsches\nNumber 9 Jordans pause the Air Forces\nKush clouds, blunts lit by Olympic torches\nGold bars melted and what returned Rolexes\nNiggas got Breitlings to burn\nLoyalty to earn\nRoyalty to who it may concern this is Los Angeles King Snapback\nSipping 'tron out the Stanley cup, I don't give a fuck\nDrown them in the moat and let the bridge up\nMy son, my heir in Nike Airs, named my little nigga King\nMeaning you should bow at his feet before God intervene\nEven when I was in front of triple beams\nStack paper to the ceiling, to the fiends I was king\n\n[Chorus: Pusha T & The Game]\nOpen the pearly gates, bright white lights Madonna\nAngels lined up in my honor, your honor\nName Me King\nName Me King\nI took the crown, infiltrated their fortress\nKidnap the queen, rode away on white horses\nName Me King\nName Me King\n\n[Verse 2: Pusha T]\nRaise your glass for the last of the kingpins\nThe crown in the Maserati grill is mingling\nRollies cross oceans like Frank out in England\nThe Gay Pride bezel rainbow like it's spring again\nHaah crack rock, crack rock nigga\nMy SC430 was a drop nigga\nGo figure, this nigga play Go Fish\nMy only pet was fish scale not a goldfish\nMy young baby sitter now my old bitch\nBlowjobs cause what I sold made her nose itch\n(EUGHK!) It's the king being crowned\nWatch my predecessor fall like the sun going down (God!)\nIt's sunset, this is Sun Tzu (War!)\nHe paved the way I brought a ton through (Whooo!)\nBeen on his heels like a gum shoe (EUGHK!)\nHe took the throne so I could run through\n\n[Chorus: Pusha T & The Game]\nOpen the pearly gates, bright white lights Madonna\nAngels lined up in my honor, your honor\nName Me King\nName Me King\nI took the crown, infiltrated their fortress\nKidnap the queen, rode away on white horses\nName Me King\nName Me King\n\n[Verse 3: Game]\nRose petals at my feet when I'm stepping out the Rolls\nThe royal penis is clean, Versace belt gold\nSweatin' like a slave where them pies get sold\nAccompanied by fourteen karats stold\nAdjust the temperature let the heat rise up\nLike Jesus Shuttlesworth in that glass jar\nBlue flame glowing like a Avatar\nFive more minutes says the silent gold hand going 'round on my Audemar\nAngels in the wing, ass naked do your thing\nShow me what that baking soda bring, do it for your king\nEvery time I look up, they cook up\nI be the master of them P's I got the hook up\nFrom New Orleans to Virginia\nI told her stuff them pies in her Virginia\nNever been caught, can't be bought, she's a winner\nFly 'em south for the winter make it back home for dinner\n\n[Chorus: Pusha T & The Game]\nOpen the pearly gates, bright white lights Madonna\nAngels lined up in my honor, your honor\nName Me King\nName Me King\nI took the crown, infiltrated their fortress\nKidnap the queen, rode away on white horses\nName Me King\nName Me King"}},

Slick down in Daygo\nYoung General these niggas gotta spray for\nYou fuck around and catch 20 out this Range Ro'\nMane that beef shit is what a nigga made for\nI open fire on her open mouth, case closed\nCame in this bitch with Chuck Taylor's screaming fuck haters\nBad bitch I'ma fuck later, tryna touch paper\nIn a 6 tre rag going brazy up the ave\nWhat I'm drinking got me thinking, nigga

start hummin' out their mouth with?\nBunch of bullshit, weak ass albums\nBunch of lil' niggas tryna copy our style\nWhen we originated this, whole mothafuckin' album had hits\nThat's why we up in the Ritz\nThat's why I'm up in your bitch, head honcho\nGet you killed pronto, wearin' red now, El Segundo\nBail long as Alonzo Mourning\nKill a nigga in his Monte Carlo like Alonzo\nSold records, sold crack, nigga, recognize\nFor the record, I've been wreckin' shit since '05\nNo lie, J's on\nTake these mothafuckas off and throw the Ye's on\nRewind, J's on\nTake these mothafuckas off and throw the Ye's on\nYeezy, tell these niggas that they is slaves\nMaster want you on red carpet like yesterday\nYou a house nigga, I'ma get away though\nCome back kill master ass like Django\nMost you niggas just rapping for the fame though\nI start rapping to get the fuck out this durango\nWhat goes around comes around, how that saying go?\nDocumentary 2, no 50, keep the change hoe\n\n[Hook: Kanye West + Sarah Barthel]\nFeelin' lonely\nLet me know if you're feelin' crazy\nI guess all that stuff they told me\nIn my life was extra shady\nI should've kept 'em waitin'\nSay hello to the mula\nI'm on top, no lie\nSay hello to the mula\nI'm on top, good night\n\n\n[Verse 2: Game & Kanye West]\nBack like I never left, nigga I'm on my second breath\nAnd I got another track from Yeezy\nHow'd you do that? Like Eric Wright said Eazy\nPull up in my cool whip, I don't give a fuck about it\nLeave it at the valet, I ain't fucked up about it\nI'll call an Uber, nigga, I'll fuckin' shoot a nigga\nI got a white bitch that blow like a tuba, nigga\nI just got a new crib, I just got a new Wraith\nI just got cooler than LL Cool J\nI just got a new gun, squeeze it like some toothpaste\nI, I, (aghhhhk)\nSpit in the face of a coward\nShit on anybody ever try to take ours\nYe why that nigga's face so sour?\nCause that slick mouth got him wet up like a shower\nNow what you know about power?\nWhat you know about dreams?\nWhat you know about freestylin' versus each other\nShelter outside of Nike Town without a dollar in your jeans\n\n[Hook: Kanye West + Sarah Barthel]\nFeelin' lonely\nLet me know if you're feelin' crazy\nI guess all that stuff they told me\nIn my life was extra shady\nI should've kept 'em waitin'\nSay hello to the mula\nI'm on top, no lie\nSay hello to the mula\nI'm on top, good night\n\n\n[Outro]\n[Felicia]\nChuck!

Wop with me\nGo 'head, go 'head, go 'head Game\n\n[Verse 1]\nFirst things first (Aftermath) The Chronic is back\nThis is indo, produced by Timbo\nGame over; nah the N.W.A. chain choker\nIs burnin rubber inside the Range Rover\nChain smokin, purple haze\nThis ain't another one of those, this the rebirth of Dre\nThe rebirth of L.A., the rebirth of hip-hop\nAnother memorial for Makaveli and Big Pop'\nHold up, Timb stop - I said\nThis another memorial for Makaveli and Big Pop'\nG-G-G-G-G - young homey got shit locked\nPublic Enemy #1, Flavor Flav with a wristwatch\nAll black G-Units, all black Impala\nI'm a schitzo, three-wheelin the six-fo'\n50 Cent know\nI'm Compton's most wanted when I'm ridin with Timbo\n\n[Chorus]\nGirl if you got a big back let me bend that\nShow me where your friends at, we can flip that\nLet me put you on the Game (let me put you on the Game)\nLet me put you on the Game (let me put you on the Game)\nI'll show you where the Bloods at, where the Crips at\nShow you where they flip crack, where they pitch at\nLet me put you on the Game (let me put you on the Game)\nLet me put you on the Game (let me put you on the Game)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI ain't got the West on my shoulder, got the West in the backseat\nOf the Rover, ridin on dubs, nigga I'm West coastin\nThe next Hova, from the home of the best doja\nMaking all that racket, I got the U.S. Open\nStunt on me, I'll leave you wit'cha chest open\nVest broken, hop in the lo-lo with the tec smokin\nG-G-G-G-G - I done paid my dues\nN.W.A. is back, this is front page news\nI got Dre in the back, ridin on 22's\nBitches screamin let me ride, it must be the shoes\nRed and black G6's, red dot on the Glock\nI'm goin three times platinum dawg, how do I stop? I'm hot\n\n[Chorus]\nGirl if you got a big back let me bend that\nShow me where your friends at, we can flip that\nLet me put you on the Game (let me put you on the Game)\nLet me put you on the Game (let me put you on the Game)\nI'll show you where the Bloods at, where the Crips at\nShow you where they flip crack, where they pitch at\nLet me put you on the Game (let me put you on the Game)\nLet me put you on the Game (let me put you on the Game)\n\n[Verse 3]\nMy Unit is Guerrilla\nFuck with my La Familia, I will kill ya\nG-G-G-G-G-Unit - I know that boy, not familiar\nBut you got to feel him if the Doctor sealed him\n(Is Compton in the house?) Without a doubt\nI'm the rapper with clout other niggas yap about\nYou know the one that introduce New York to the beach cruiser\nGot 'em puttin red and blue strings in they G-Units\nGet \"Groupie Love,\" tell 'em to keep movin\nIf I got a problem with a bitch I let Eve do it\nUnless she got on LePearla and I can see through it\nI don't just let her ride, I give her the keys to it\nMe and my bitch lay back in the Coupe\nI'm movin in the neighborhood, I ain't passin through\nI woulda been here after Snoop, but I slowed down\nTo show Timbaland how to iron a khaki suit\n\n[Chorus]\nGirl if you got a big back let me bend that\nShow me where your friends at, we can flip that\nLet me put you on the Game (let me put you on the Game)\nLet me put you on the Game (let me put you on the Game)\nI'll show you where the Bloods at, where the Crips at\nShow you where they flip crack, where they pitch at\nLet me put you on the Game (let me put you on the Game)\nLet me put you on the Game (let me put you on the Game)"}}, {"title": "Holy Water", "album": "Jesus Piece", "year": "2012-12-11", "lyrics": "[Produced by SAP]\n\n[Hook]\nMy Phantom so mean\nLike I washed that motherfucker every Sunday in holy water\nMy Jesus piece clean\nEven my shoes are Christians, I'm walking on holy water\nShe came out them True Religion jeans\nAnd fell straight to her knees like she was dipped in holy water\nHoly water\nHoly water\n\n[Verse 1]\nBack when Michael Jordan was raw\n'92 was the year my city was city of God\nCoke on the boulevard, crack fiends skiing the slaloms\nIs exactly how drug lords found their way from the bottom\nThem Yeezy's drop got 'em, couldn't afford 'em you shot 'em\nCause they the same price as fucking red bottoms\nWe don't pop tags, leave that motherfucker on it\nReturn it back to the store when you no longer want it\nSleep outside for days for a pair of J's\nThen you sleep outside forever cause you got sprayed\nIf you gon' die for em, they better be some number 4's\nOr some shit made in Japan you can never find in the stores\nRolex watches, Gucci belts, and Louis luggage\nDefinitely set us apart from niggas when we in public\nJeffery Campbell and Michael Kors got you looking rugged\nGave her a Louis bag, now she love me\nTake a look at her posin' on my car cause\n\n[Hook]\nMy Phantom so mean\nLike I washed that motherfucker every Sunday in holy water\nMy Jesus piece clean\nEven my shoes are Christians, I'm walking on holy water\nShe came out them True Religion jeans\nAnd fell straight to her knees like she was dipped in holy water\nHoly water\nHoly water\n\n[Verse 2]\nMet a girl named Christian in some Christian, she a Christian\nSuck a dick like sucking dick is her life's mission\nTrynna' save her ass like trynna' save a stripper\nShe fine as fuck, you trynna' fuck, that's the reason you tip her\nAnd all I'm sayin' is a watch and a gold chain\nCan't make Bobby Valentino, Johnny Coltrane\nAnd she knows this, that's why her mouth wide\nOpenin' up her legs straight up like they suicide\nI cross my heart and hope to die\nIf something happens to my voice and can no longer provide\nShould I run and hide?

in holy water\nMy Jesus piece clean\nEven my shoes are Christians, I'm walking on holy water\nShe came out them True Religion jeans\nAnd fell straight to her knees like she was dipped in holy water\nHoly water\nHoly water\n\n[Verse 1]\nBack when Michael Jordan was raw\n'92 was the year my city was city of God\nCoke on the boulevard, crack fiends skiing the slaloms\nIs exactly how drug lords found their way from the bottom\nThem Yeezy's drop got 'em, couldn't afford 'em you shot 'em\nCause they the same price as fucking red bottoms\nWe don't pop tags, leave that motherfucker on it\nReturn it back to the store when you no longer want it\nSleep outside for days for a pair of J's\nThen you sleep outside forever cause you got sprayed\nIf you gon' die for em, they better be some number 4's\nOr some shit made in Japan you can never find in the stores\nRolex watches, Gucci belts, and Louis luggage\nDefinitely set us apart from niggas when we in public\nJeffery Campbell and Michael Kors got you looking rugged\nGave her a Louis bag, now she love me\nTake a look at her posin' on my car cause\n\n[Hook]\nMy Phantom so mean\nLike I washed that motherfucker every Sunday in holy water\nMy Jesus piece clean\nEven my shoes are Christians, I'm walking on holy water\nShe came out them True Religion jeans\nAnd fell straight to her knees like she was dipped in holy water\nHoly water\nHoly water\n\n[Verse 2]\nMet a girl named Christian in some Christian, she a Christian\nSuck a dick like sucking dick is her life's mission\nTrynna' save her ass like trynna' save a

back\nNiggas goin' gold, \"shit them is nice plaques\"\nFinally, get your ass in the ring\nWon't fucking fight back\nEverybody wants you to swing, go ahead and strike back\nMe I'm spitting nothing but flames\nI'm like a strike match\nEmpire Strikes Back, Jedi Mind Tricks\nThis is how the stars war, why you acting hard for?\nMe, I'm hardcore, middle of Darfur\nYou don't wanna see what the fuck is inside the car door\nI got something big under the T-shirt\nOn the front it say \"Tha Carter IV\"\nI'm about to order more\nNigga they ain't told you?\nIt's like the Gulf War\nPut a hole in one of you niggas, no par 4\n'Rari on the green, got a V12 Ferrari on the green\nI be twisting Bob Marley on the green\nI took 100 thou just to add another Mazerati to the team\nShould of saw me as a teen, facin' the magazine\nAny drama, I'm loading up a case of the magazines\nNot the Source or the XXL know what I mean?\nRolling Stone, ain't getting my Vibe\nSo I remain King\nAt least til T.I. home\nAs far as the east, ain't no King nigga B.I. gone\nFar as bars that four ocho cinco\nSo the next line is for Ocho Cinco\nEasy on the Clicqot, homie don't drink so\nI'mma guzzle the bottle and find me a fucking sink yo\nWhere Otis? Somewhere playing Bingo\nStar on my face, I'm a star like Ringo\nTen bars left, su woo is the lingo\nAll red everything, no visine though\nJust left Boston, no Benzino\nHit something out in New York, Bambino\nAnd I coach my team like Pitino\nHe know, we hit King of Diamonds\nEverybody throwing C-Notes\nOn my way to Sin City, pit stopped in Reno\nFeeling like Carlito before they casted Pacino\nMatter fact fuck him, De Niro in Casino\n500th bar, Fuck You; Cee Lo"}}, {"title": "Don't Trip", "album": "The Documentary 2", "year": "2015-10-09", "lyrics": "[Produced by

Blood\nI make it rain in Compton like it's a strip club\nI grew up on Santana block, that's where the Crips was\nMy mama house was in the middle of the street\nHow was a nigga supposed to get to school?\nI hopped every backyard on my block\nTill I got to  Elm Street, took the rag out my sock\nAnd I could have been a Crip but I ain't like blue that much\nAll Crip school, I ain't really go to school that much\nI was selling crack on Elm, bagging up sacks on Elm\nWith the ratchet in my Bulls jacket, giving you the facts on Elm\nKing Frog and Big Face had my back on Elm\nWe was fighting over territory with the T-Flats on Elm\nI had to scrap on Elm, that's how I got my stripes\nAir Max 95s, not a scratch on my Nikes\n2016 motherfucker, don't you pull it\n'Cause I made it out of Compton with a stab wound and five bullets\n\n[Chorus: The Game & will.i.am]\nDon't trip on me oh, don't trip on me oh\nDon't trip on me oh, don't trip on me oh\nDon't trip on me oh, don't trip on me

Game]\n'Cause I'm bool like that, I'm bool like that\nI'm bool like that, yeah I'm bool like that\nThey say \"Game, why you always act a fool like that?\"\n'Cause I went to Compton High Crip School like that\nI was Blood and I ain't really like blue like that\nThey was Crippin they ain't give a fuck who like that\nThem niggas jumped me, why they have to do a 'Ru like that?\nNigga went and got the homies and we flew right back\nThey C like that, we B like that\nWe trip like that cause LA sick like that\nWe Blood like that, we Crip like that\nThe blunt lit like that, we out\n\n[Outro: will.i.am]\nWhen you ready, lemme know\nWhen you want it, lemme know, I got it\nWhen you see me, congratulate a nigga, don't hate\nNiggas will always be niggas, yep, true\nThat's why I don't trip on these niggas, would you?\nNiggas is wild like gorillas that's stuck in that zoo, yep\nWhat happens when niggas unite and start making them moves\nDon't trip"}}, {"title": "How We Do (Remix)", "album":

this and don't slip\nOn a funky-dope track, jump back\nStrapped with a fat buddha sack and a 7-8 'lac\nCome clean, gangsta lean, I got green\nBud, I serve dubs like it ain't no thing\nI hang with OG playas, don't set trip\nOr you might get what we call a rat pack\nI don't slack when it come to street\nI kick real G-funk to a gangsta beat\nIt's so sweet, when you got money to spend\nI got a proper big tilt and a fly-big Benz\nI make ends, spend my dough on no foe\nThat's how it is, and that's how it goes\nAct like you know when I creep real slow\nGivin' love to them players that I know is real G's\n\n[Verse 2: 2Pac]\nNow ever since a nigga was a seed\nOnly thing promised to me was the penitentiary\nStill ballin', ridin' on these niggas \u2018cause they lame\nIn a '61 Chevy, still heavy in this game\nCan you feel me? Blame it on my mama, I'm a thug nigga\nUp before the sunrise, quicker than the drug dealers\nTell me if it's on, nigga, then we first to bomb, bust\nOn these bitch-made niggas, hit 'em up!\nWestside! Ain't nobody loved me as a broke nigga\nFinger on the trigger, Lord, forgive me if I smoke niggas\nI love my females strapped, no fuckin' from the back\nI get my currency in stacks, California's where I'm at\nRidin', passed by while these niggas wondered why\nI got shot but didn't die, let 'em see who's next to try\nDid I cry? Hell nah, nigga, tears shed\nFor all my homies in the pen, many peers dead\nNiggas still ballin'\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nThis is how we do\nWe make a move and act a fool while we up in the club\nThis is how we do\nNobody do it like we do it, so show us some love\nThis is how we do\nWe make a move and act a fool while we up in the club\nThis is how we do\nNobody do it like we do it, so show us some love\n\n[Verse 3: 2Pac]\nNow everybody wanna see us dead\nTwo murdered on the front page\nShot to death, bullets to the head\nNiggas holler out my name and it's similar to rape\nMothafuckas know I'm comin'\nSo they runnin' to they graves\nWatch!

fall\nScuffin my Air Forces, runnin through the hospital hall\nDeja vu, like I been here before\nI'm feelin reborn, like a Bed-Stuy breddern\nMy first born, Dre I'm bout to have a Bad Boy\nFamily in the lobby, see my nigga Church, whatup\nShit, I left the camcorder in the truck\nRunnin through the maternity ward, out of breath, sweatin\nI swear to God every minute's startin to feel like a second\nI see hell starin down the barrel of a Smith and Wesson\nMy son's ultrasound the closest I ever been to heaven\nLord forgive me for my sins, I know it's last minute\nPut the chronic in the air, a lil' hash in it\nSpread my wings, if only I could fly\nWhy fight to live homie if we livin to die?\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes]\nI hope you grow up to become that everything you can be\nThat's all I wanted for you young'n, like father, like son\nBut in the end I hope you'll only turn out better than me\nI hope you know I love you young'n, like father, like son\nMy little man your day is coming\nComing, your day is coming\nI tell ya, and when it comes just keep it running\nRunning, just keep it running, I tell you\n\n[Verse 2: The Game]\nThey say every time somebody die, a child is born\nSo I thank the nigga who gave his life for the birth of my son\n11:32, she screamin at the top of her lungs\nI'm panicking, nurse yellin for the doctor to come\nAll I can remember was Lemaze class, breathe baby\nOne (one) two (two) three (three) four (four)\nI see the head, Doc bustin through the door\nHe between the legs, he see the head, it's my baby boy!\n11:46 the head out, she screamin makin crazy noise\nPain is love, my stomach foldin like a La-Z-Boy\nI'm feelin like Mariah Carey, all these butterflies\nVoices singin to me sound like Teena Marie\nI'm callin niggas on tour\nJayo tell Spinz I just cut the umbilical cord\n11:57, a soldier is born\nAnd he's flesh of my flesh, young Harlem Caron\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes]\nI hope you grow up to become that everything you can be\nThat's all I wanted for you young'n, like father, like son\nBut in the end I hope you'll only turn out better than me\nI hope you know I love you young'n, like father, like son\nMy little man your day is coming\nComing, your day is coming\nI tell ya, and when it comes just keep it running\nRunning, just keep it running, I tell you\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nI wanna thank Dr. Aswork and Nurse Teresa\nFor bringin my baby boy to life, you birthed a Caesar\nAnd my baby momma Alyska, for pushin out a ten pound\nFour ounce Mini-Me, I still can't believe it\nNose ears eyes chin, just like your daddy\nI'd die before you grow up and be just like your daddy\nOr your grandfather; call Uncle Zeb\nTell him I got a son and I ain't even in Harlem\nI'm poppin Crist' wit'cha godfathers\nBaron Davis and D. Mac, Darrius Rogers\nDrop the top on the '71\nWith my face in the clouds, Lord spare my son\nAnd watch over Eric Wright, T'yanna, and Lil' Pun\nLowridin, bangin, \"Ready to Die,\" track #1\nIf I bust five times, and they never see the sun\nMy life is a black hole, like the barrel of a gun\nOne\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes]\nI hope you grow up to become that everything you can be\nThat's all I wanted for you young'n, like father, like son\nBut in the end I hope you'll only turn out better than me\nI hope you know I love you young'n, like father, like son\nMy little man your day is coming\nComing, your day is coming\nI tell ya, and when it comes just keep it running\nRunning, just keep it running, I tell you"}}, {"title": "Freedom", "album": "Jesus Piece", "year": "2012-12-11", "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Game]\nHoldin' my daughter in the booth\nHer momma out there somewhere in that Bentley trynna find a roof\nPoof, I wave my wand and here comes Kendrick\nNiggas say the west ain't winnin', I'm just tryin' to find the proof\nSpeakin' of Proof, I'm 'bout to roll one with Snoop\nBlow the smoke out to your memory and toast to Eminem\nCause he, gave me the shit that I needed on Documentary\nKeep it real with myself, I got murdered like John Kennedy\nBut that was cool cause I was just there for the energy\nWatchin' Bizarre pop pills while 2Pac in my hennessy\nFirst time in Detroit, had to rock the Grant Hills\nCause I threw up my dukes when California was at a stand still\nBut hope ain't lost cause Dr. Dre the man still\nHad faith in me, knew I had heat like an anvil\nRan through entire crews, put their remains in a landfill\nAnd I ain't lost the hunger, I'm eatin' out the can still\n\nYeah, wherever Hov and Nas at in the world right now\nI know they listenin' like\nThis young nigga be killin' this shit\nHip-hop is life's C\u00eeroc I'm 'bout to drop a pill in this shit\nLet's go, esco bars nigga, like Nas nigga\nThe flow is Rakim with the Birdman cars nigga\nHold on I gotta take Birdman's call nigga\n\n[Break]\nStunna, whattup blood?\n\"Whattup blood?

momma out there somewhere in that Bentley trynna find a roof\nPoof, I wave my wand and here comes Kendrick\nNiggas say the west ain't winnin', I'm just tryin' to find the proof\nSpeakin' of Proof, I'm 'bout to roll one with Snoop\nBlow the smoke out to your memory and toast to Eminem\nCause he, gave me the shit that I needed on Documentary\nKeep it real with myself, I got murdered like John Kennedy\nBut that was cool cause I was just there for the energy\nWatchin' Bizarre pop pills while 2Pac in my hennessy\nFirst time in Detroit, had to rock the Grant Hills\nCause I threw up my dukes when California was at a stand still\nBut hope ain't lost cause Dr. Dre the man still\nHad faith in me, knew I had heat like an anvil\nRan through entire crews, put their remains in a landfill\nAnd I ain't lost the hunger, I'm eatin' out the can still\n\nYeah, wherever Hov and Nas at in the world right now\nI know they listenin' like\nThis young nigga be killin' this shit\nHip-hop is life's

imagine I'm home\nI miss the days when life was simple\nBut if I never tried to follow that rainbow\nIn search of the pot of gold\nWoah, woah\nIn search of the pot of gold\n\n[Verse 1: The Game]\nIt's a mother out there right now 'bout to have the next LeBron\nSearchin' for a pot of gold like a leprechaun\nThey say death comes in threes, who's next in line?\nAnd I just lost a best friend for the second time\nNow I'm on a quest to find peace\nStill gotta carry my piece and, \"Soo Woo!\" when it's reppin' time\nY'all don't understand, I'm misunderstood\nGive Interscope two more albums then I'm done for good\nSold 10 million records, ain't leave the hood\nIt's a cold world, everybody need a hood\nAnd everybody doin' time, stay headstrong\nYou still got a chance to live even though you dead wrong\n\n[Chorus: Chris Brown]\nOh, the spotlight is not for me\nI close my eyes and imagine I'm home\nI miss the days when life was simple\nBut if I never tried to follow that rainbow\nIn search of the pot of gold\nWoah, woah\nIn search of the pot of gold\n\n[Verse 2: The Game]\nSometimes I try to do good but I just can't be\nIt's hard to get myself to do things that ain't me\nAnd y'all should thank me\nBut my haters busy tryna send me home early\nBut you can't New Orlean Saint me\nI ain't a saint, B, I ain't a god, God\nI ain't a angel neither, but I try hard, y'all\nI'm lightin' up for all my soldiers at war\nAs I sit back and watch the ashes on my cigar fall\nWayne just came home and Tip back on the, yard dawg\nGuess Pujols ain't the only one playin' hard ball\n\n[Chorus: Chris Brown]\nOh, the spotlight is not for me\nI close my eyes and imagine I'm home\nI miss the days when life was simple\nBut if I never tried to follow that rainbow\nIn search of the pot of gold\nWoah, woah\nIn search of the pot of gold\n\n[Bridge: Chris Brown]\nOh, see the thing about all of us is\nWe never know just what we were\n\n[Chorus: Chris Brown]\nOh, the spotlight is not for me (no, it ain't)\nI close my eyes and imagine I'm home (home)\nI miss the days when life was simple (yeah)\nBut if I never tried to follow that rainbow\nIn search of the pot of gold (in search for the pot of

There have been a multitude of artists who exist in different locations but still collaborate with their opposition.\n\nMany gang members are gathered while they\u2019re still young and are lucky if they live to see their adult years. Even though the members know and understand they will put their friends, families, and selves at risk, they continue to participate in the violence that they know will eventually destroy them.

can\u2019t remember names\nBut if you put that pussy right up in my face, I remember\nDrop that pussy down on the floor, I remember\nThe way she comin' down on the pole, I remember)\n\n[Verse 1: Game]\nPop the pussy, don\u2019t play with it\nI don\u2019t care if Kanye hit it, I don\u2019t care if Jay hit it\nI\u2019mma eat it up and I\u2019mma lay with it\nWe shot a chopper at the gun range\nGot stupid cars, got dumb change\nRed bottoms, let the tongue hang\nGot an off-white Porsche, cum stain\nI\u2019m whippin\u2019 work (I remember)\nRoll up that purp (I remember)\nPour up that syrup (I don\u2019t remember)\n(How Tunechi had that purple Slushy comin\u2019 out that blender)\nGot a Keisha, got a Rhonda\nGot a Nisha, got a Tanya\nGot a Tishaun and a Honda\nAnd I eat her

\u2018Rari shit, I drove it like I stole it\nThe Lambo' in the shop, told my bitch to Range Rove\nMicrowave broke, so a nigga had to stove it\nDropped it off to my Auntie, told her hold it\nI\u2019m posted right now, posted in this Gucci link\n87 did 30 mil', wonder what Coogi think\nQuarters, 9 1/2 sold  (I remember)\nYeah, it\u2019s the middle of June, and it\u2019s snowing like December\nIf you get into the \u2018sac in your hood, I could mend ya\u2019\nYa\u2019 nigga talking reckless on your song, I\u2019ll revenge ya\u2019\nPull up to the club in a Phantom, I had a vision\nBreak

that brick inside a pot and cook it, whip it good though\nBaking soda inside of her bowl, hey yo, watch me blow\nPromethazine mixed with a Sprite, pour a fo'\nBeen sipping syrup all night, and I get higher than a plane (Pluto)\nYeah, I remember your pussy, girl, but I don\u2019t know your name\nI got diamonds hanging off if they could talk it'd be insane\nEver since I gave her that molly, man that girl ain\u2019t been the same\nBetter pop the pussy for a real nigga\nThat\u2019s on the way, I\u2019mma deal with ya\nI\u2019m a real boss, that real sauce\nDon\u2019t try me bitch, I will

a question nobody got the answer to\nSo PURGE!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3c242f72b054b6d20e2e8fd97f060d73.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "The Game", "raw": {"annotation_count": 31,

resurfaced with some leeches\nTen times platinum, now I'm chillin', where the beach is?\nTime to show the world, what a motherfuckin' beast is\nBlanca, bulletproof cars in Sri Lanka\nTwelve years old, on his shoulder, a rocket launcher\nTen thousand miles away, there's an owner of a corner store\nA white man walks in, spit shinin' his Audemars\nWhile somewhere in Africa, Jo-Burg and Congo is goin' to war\nRebels enslavin' they own people, diggin' water or\nGet murdered 'cause that choppa is a carnivore\nHe found one and stole it, now the village tryna find that boy\n\n[Hook: Game]\nBlood diamonds\nLook at blood diamonds\nBlood diamonds\nNow take a look at blood diamonds\nBlood diamonds\nLook at blood diamonds\nBlood diamonds\nNow take a look at blood diamonds\n\n[Verse 2: Game]\nHow you sellin' the shit our people is diggin' for?\nDiamonds, cotton, that belong to niggas though\nLeBron and Durantula gave America a look at gold\nAnd what you give us back, is another fucking liquor store\nAnd we need blunts, so we walk in that motherfucker\nMoney in the safe, so we in that motherfucker\nBut you can't forget the tape, tryna pin a motherfucker\nDA ain't got a case, I'ma win that mothercuker\nAnd it ain\u2019t about the Chinese, dude, I eat Chinese food\nWhere you think Michael Jordan find these shoes\nWe robbin\u2019 each other for 'em, think I should hide these jewels\nRun up on you in broad day with them Siamese tools\nBut nah, Mandela did twenty-eight straight\nWithout a fucking complaint, put an afro on a Saint\nPut a wig on a judge, put a nigga in some chains\nOver change, kill him, lethal injection inside his veins\n\n[Hook: Game]\nBlood diamonds\nLook at blood diamonds\nBlood diamonds\nNow take a look at blood diamonds\n\n[Verse 3: Game]\nBrutus killed Ceasar and Judas killed Jesus\nJohn Wilkes Boothe killed Lincoln and you thought he freed slaves\nWhat the fuck was you thinkin'? Nigga fuck Lincoln\nI\u2019m rolling up kush in my Lincoln, now let it sink in\nRolled against Obama now you divin' in the deep end\nI\u2019d rather take my chances at this water fountain drinkin'\nWhere the fuck is the loyalty, knock these niggas fuckin\u2019 teeth in?\nIn the hood singin' like they Aubrey or The Weeknd\nPull that towel from under that door, and let it seep in\nThere's a lot of shit I don\u2019t like, so bring Chief Keef in\nI don\u2019t like these phony ass jewelers with that fake shit\nOvercharging niggas an arm and leg, just to make shit\nAnd you wonder why we take shit, y'all put us on slave ships\nThat\u2019s the reason we hate shit, rob our own niggas for them\n\n[Hook: Game]\nBlood diamonds\nLook at blood diamonds\nBlood diamonds\nNow take a look at blood diamonds\nBlood diamonds\nLook at blood diamonds\nBlood diamonds\nNow take a look at blood diamonds"}}, {"title": "Standing on Ferraris", "album": "The Documentary 2", "year": "2015-10-09", "lyrics": "[Produced by Jahlil Beats]\n\n[Intro: The Game & Diddy]\nI put that on Piru\nYo Game, let's go\n\n[Chorus: Game]\nI've been shot stabbed, left for dead, walked through every hood in LA\nBandana on my head, guarantee that shit was red\nMachetes and them choppers out, bitches with their knockers out\nI done fucked 'em all, that's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga\nFrom the corner playing lookout to kitchen cookouts\nYeah, that's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga\nIn a 64, 6'5, too big for a Bugatti\nThat's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga\n\n[Verse 1: Game & Diddy]\nRan the west for a decade nigga, check the bio\nGave you Cincinnati fitteds like I get it in Ohio\nAutographs on the vinyl made the Lamb albino\nStraight away in the Wraith, that's a Peyton Manning spiral\nYou lookin' at your idol, Jesus wrote the Bible\nYeezus, that's my Nike town rival\nDare a nigga try me now, like why me now\nLookin' for Red Octobers, I will tie him down\nStay laced, spit nothin' but based, yeah\nAll my shit bump like Craig Mack face\nAsk your favorite bitch how my dick taste (Baaaaaaaaddd Boyyyyyy)\nAsk your neighbor's bitch how my dick taste\nDon't take orders, I dictate, get your shit straight\nDickface, perpetual Rollies with the big face\nI got 'em lovin' the movement\nBeard so long, I'm feelin' like Rick Rubin\n\n[Chorus: Game]\nI've been shot stabbed, left for dead, walked through every hood in LA\nBandana on my head, guarantee that shit was red\nMachetes and them choppers out, bitches with their knockers out\nI done fucked 'em all, that's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga\nFrom the corner playing lookout to kitchen cookouts\nYeah, that's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga\nIn a 64, 6'5, too big for a Bugatti\nThat's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga\n\n[Verse 2: Game]\nTop floor at the Biltmore, say they want a\nWar, shit, that's what I'm built for, loungin'\nMiami with the eye candy\nBitches names Sandy and Bambi, my exes can't stand me\nGod blessed the nigga with more swag than Jigga\nMore hoes than Trigga, Trigga know, that's my nigga though\nFigure four down, Figueroa, Ric Flair\nPhantom, all red flannel, niggas don't hit me though\nSpit on models, R.Kelly, piss on the center fold\nEver since Doc showed me a billion in a envelope\nLove Jimmy, fuck Interscope, I'm a don\nWalk outside, naked, Cuban cigar and Louboutins, huh\nShit on my lawn, snakes in the grass\nI hear 'em slitherin' and hissin' whenever I pass\nRidin' 'round in somethin' French; Khloe Kardash'\nTwo-hundred on the dash, that's your ass\n\n[Chorus: Game]\nI've been shot stabbed, left for dead, walked through every hood in LA\nBandana on my head, guarantee that shit was red\nMachetes and them choppers out, bitches with their knockers out\nI done fucked 'em all, that's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga\nFrom the corner playing lookout to kitchen cookouts\nYeah, that's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga\nIn a 64, 6'5, too big for a Bugatti\nThat's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga\n\n[Outro: Diddy]\nYo, this nigga Game bought me a motherfuckin' red Ferrari for my birthday, nigga.

ever since the day I've got the chance to make a change\nI've been in this game, it's a new day\nAnd I'm makin it known cause, I just want the world to know\nI'm payin my dues, and I got the utmost, I just wanna let you know\nI'm payin homage cause, you've paved the way for meeee, ye-yeah\n\n[Verse 1: The Game]\nI swear to God, it feel like every day is my birthday\nLet the top down, California's my birthplace\nSo I'mma take you there like B.I.G took niggas to New York\n\"Juicy\" had us feelin like we was from New York\nAnd that's real shit, blazed the Philly\nIt's \"Summertime\", shout out to Will Smith\nCause who didn't wanna be the Fresh Prince?\nFlat top, gold chain and some fresh kicks\nMy nigga Nas told me \"Money Make the World go Round\"\nAnd Uncle Luke showed me how to make my girl go down\nI've been around Hip Hop since '85\nShe had her ups and downs but she stayed alive\nI used to think LL stood for \"Love LA\"\nHe from Queens, how the fuck he put that with Cool J?\nRed Kangol hat, red sweatsuit to match\nRed Adidas, nigga, Game is back\n\n[Hook: Keyshia Cole]\nAnd ever since the day I got the chance to make a change\nI've been in this game, it's a new day\nAnd I'm makin it known cause, I just want the world to know\nI'm payin my dues, and I got the utmost, I just wanna let you know\nI'm payin homage cause, you've paved the way for meeee, ye-yeah\n\n[Verse 2: The Game] (Keyshia Cole)\nPublic Enemy and N.W.A\nIs all my boombox had to say\n\"Today was a Good Day\" had the hood buzzin\nIce Cube my favorite rapper, y'all niggas can't tell me nothing\nEverybody first bootleg was \"Boyz N the Hood\"\nWhoever thought gangsta rap would make noise in the hood?\nWhen the cars ride by with the \"Boomin' System\"\nTwo door Mustang, and the roof was missin'\nEvery girl at your school had the new extensions\nEven gangstas was dancin' like New Edition\nCause the house parties stayed rockin all night\nNiggas came through and shot it up but it was alright (alright)\nCause after the cops left, it was a party then\nYou down with O.P.P.?

it)\nI'll be on top, as soon as the beat drop\nI'll make the whole club rock (I do it)\n\n[Verse 1]\nLace my Air Ones up, put my gun up\nI don't need that, I'm ridin wit Dre\nWho don't love us, every hood throwin they dubs up\nWho the fuck y'all thought was comin' after Young Buck?\nHip-Hop's worst nightmare\nMr. Gangsta Rap is back in black Nike Airs\nYou want war, we can settle it right here\nI got a squad, E-V-E and Busta Rhymes yeah\nOr you could give me ya bitch, her with the light hair\nSit her next to these yellow bottles, yeah right there\nMatter fact I'll take you in the back\nYou in the hat, and you in the blue and the black\nLet's have a gangsta party\nSomebody lean over and tell Banks to order another case of 40's\nYo Doc give 'em a Coke with that\nWake up the West coast is back\n\n[Hook]\n(I can take you higher)\nShow you how that low rider bounce off the flo' - You ain't know?\n(I can take you higher)\nIt's the motherfuckin chronic nigga that's whassup - roll that blunt\n(I can take you higher)\nG-Unit, Shady, Aftermath I'm the motherfuckin Game and\n(I can take you higher)\n\n[Bridge]\nIt's not that I can't stop, it's that I won't stop\nI'll make it hot (I do it)\nI'll be on top, as soon as the beat drop\nI'll make the whole club rock (I do it)\n\n[Verse 2]\nLike Dre did\nI created a buzz without a single like N.W.A. did\nFrom the hood liquor store to the state pen\nThis is Gin & Juice to Doc\nMake the club R.O.C. without Timberland boots\nFirst nigga to put 'draulics on a Bentley Coupe\nYou wanna pimp? I'll perm my shit up like Snoop (Ah, Westside)\n\"Chronic 2005\" muh'fucker\nPut the purple in the dutch \"Let it Burn\" like Usher - giirl\nDrop down, do the eagle, fuck that\nReal niggas just pull up they pants and lean back - giirl\nMake 50 spill his Crist', he'll call you a bitch\nI'mma call you and hit\nYou can call ya girlfriend, we can make it a flick\nI got the lollipop if you wanna lick\nOr you can take a ride on the magic stick\n\n[Hook]\n(I can take you higher)\nShow you how that low rider bounce off the flo' - You ain't know?\n(I can take you higher)\nIt's the motherfuckin chronic nigga that's whassup - roll that blunt\n(I can take you higher)\nG-Unit, Shady, Aftermath I'm the motherfuckin Game and\n(I can take you higher)\n\n[Bridge]\nIt's not that I can't stop, it's that I won't stop\nI'll make it hot (I do it)\nI'll be on top, as soon as the beat drop\nI'll make the whole club rock (I do it)\n\n[Verse 3]\nPut 25's on a Hummer, why not?\nI'mma be here for the next 10 summers\nDrop me in the 4th quarter I'm fuckin up they money\nI don't need SoundScan I'm doin my own numbers\nWhen that Impala bounce you can see the chrome under\nI got 'em in every color, yeah I'm a known stunner\nWhen I hit a switch I get higher than long jumpers\nLowridin with a hood rat or a grown woman\nI'll do anything - but I won't fuck Mariah\nEven if she had Ashanti butt naked in bed\nCause she got a fo'head just like Tyra\nI can say what the fuck I want\nYou thought Dre retired, left me a six-fo' and his Dayton wires?\nThese niggas is a waste of rhymin\nDoc got somthin to say be quiet\n(Look out for Detox)\n\n[Hook]\n(I can take you higher)\nShow you how that low rider bounce off the flo' -

this one nigga\nI ain't gon' jump though, I'mma keep it raw gutter\nYo Prodigy, you know I need you on this one nigga\n\n[Verse 1: The Game]\nI got shit on my chest, I must confess\nLast night I was the nigga that shot up your projects\nNow I'm back in the hood, with rocks in the Pyrex\nTan khakis and them Nike Airs with the dyed checks\nI was forced to live this life, forced to bust my chrome\nMy pops left me in a foster home\nI felt abandoned like Quik now that Mausberg gone\nSo I don't hop in the SS without the Mossberg homes\nI've been rappin' for a year and a half, my life is real\nPut the gun in his mouth, he gon' bite the steel\nCome to Compton, I got stripes for real\nBefore Dre, before the ice, before the deal - I was almost killed\nLike 'Pac before the Death Row deal\nI got shot over two pounds of weed, still ain't found them niggas\nBut karma come quicker for a nigga on the other side of the gun\nThat's somethin I gotta teach my son\n\n[Hook: Faith Evans]\nI don't need your love, no no no no\nI don't need your love\nNeed it, I don't want it, I don't need it\nI don't need your love, no I don't need your love\nI don't need your love\nCause, the, game, don't, change\n\n[Verse 2: The Game]\nI heard they got Bloods in New York now\nRed rags in Uptown Harlem now, I need that love\nFront court at the Knicks game, new chick, French name\nNew car, new house, and sometimes friends change\nAnd you don't need that love, when you G's like us\nAnd your Jesus piece is sim-u-lar to Biggie's\nAnd your life story is sim-u-lar to 50's\nFirst they hate you, then they love you, then they hate you again\nWhat the fuck do it take for a gangsta to win?\nNo mics, no Unsigned Hype, nigga fuck The Source\nPlus them awards I don't need\nAnd them niggas breathing the same air as me, acting like they don't bleed\nWe don't drive the same speed, this a Continental T\nThat's a case of Armadale, this a continental suite\nSo I'mma drown in my own sorrows\nLive life, fuck tomorrow, nigga cause reality is\n\n[Hook: Faith Evans] w/ variations + ad libs\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nI was gassed up, Murder Inc., Roc-A-Fella passed up\nSat in Daddy's House with Black Rob and Lou and asked Puff\nNow The Game's set in stone, the Franck Muller's set in stones\nDre cut me a check, I'm gone\nTryin to be the king of the streets, niggas'll wet your throne\nBut I got nieces to feed, two coasts to please\nSo I roam through the city like the ghost of E\nGotta put Compton back where it's 'sposed to be\nNothing between all my niggas that's close to me\nIn the streets with two fellas packing toast for me\nI'm 'posed to be, got all the critics watching my pivot\nOn my block in the Coupe reading kites from prison\nI got niggas doing life in prison\nAll my fallen soldiers is one of the reasons we pour out liquor\nSo this song is for Ms. Wallace, Afeni Shakur\nAnd all the mothers of dead sons that went out in the war\n\n[Hook: Faith Evans] - 2X w/ variations + ad libs",

though, I'mma keep it raw gutter\nYo Prodigy, you know I need you on this one nigga\n\n[Verse 1: The Game]\nI got shit on my chest, I must confess\nLast night I was the nigga that shot up your projects\nNow I'm back in the hood, with rocks in the Pyrex\nTan khakis and them Nike Airs with the dyed checks\nI was forced to live this life, forced to bust my chrome\nMy pops left me in a foster home\nI felt abandoned like Quik now that Mausberg gone\nSo I don't hop in the SS without the Mossberg homes\nI've been rappin' for a year and a half, my life is real\nPut the gun in his mouth, he gon' bite the steel\nCome to Compton, I got stripes for real\nBefore Dre, before the ice, before the deal - I was almost killed\nLike 'Pac before the Death Row deal\nI got shot over two pounds of weed, still ain't found them niggas\nBut karma come quicker for a nigga on the other side of the gun\nThat's somethin I gotta teach my son\n\n[Hook: Faith Evans]\nI don't need your love, no no no no\nI don't need your love\nNeed it, I don't want it, I don't need it\nI don't need your love, no I don't need your love\nI don't need your love\nCause, the, game, don't, change\n\n[Verse 2: The Game]\nI heard they got Bloods in New York now\nRed rags in Uptown Harlem now, I need that love\nFront court at the Knicks game, new chick, French name\nNew car, new house, and sometimes friends change\nAnd you don't need that love, when you G's like us\nAnd your Jesus piece is sim-u-lar to Biggie's\nAnd your life story is sim-u-lar to 50's\nFirst they hate you, then they love you, then they hate you again\nWhat the fuck do it take for a gangsta to win?\nNo mics, no Unsigned Hype, nigga fuck The Source\nPlus them awards I don't need\nAnd them niggas breathing the same air as me, acting like they don't bleed\nWe don't drive the same speed, this a Continental T\nThat's a case of Armadale, this a continental suite\nSo I'mma drown in my own sorrows\nLive life, fuck tomorrow, nigga cause reality is\n\n[Hook: Faith Evans] w/ variations + ad libs\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nI was gassed up, Murder Inc., Roc-A-Fella passed up\nSat in Daddy's House with Black Rob and Lou and asked Puff\nNow The Game's set in stone, the Franck Muller's set in stones\nDre cut me a check, I'm gone\nTryin to be the king of the streets, niggas'll wet your throne\nBut I got nieces to feed, two coasts to please\nSo I roam through the city like the ghost of E\nGotta put Compton back where it's 'sposed to be\nNothing between all my niggas that's close to me\nIn the streets with two fellas packing toast for me\nI'm 'posed to be, got all the critics watching my pivot\nOn my block in the Coupe reading kites from prison\nI got niggas doing life in prison\nAll my fallen soldiers is one of the reasons we pour out liquor\nSo this song is for Ms. Wallace, Afeni Shakur\nAnd all the mothers of dead sons that went out in the war\n\n[Hook: Faith Evans] - 2X w/ variations + ad libs"}}, {"title": "Ol'

English)\n(Rags tied, gang sign)\nLetters on my hat in (Old English)\n(Drive-by, homicide)\nR.I.P. tats in (Old English)\n(Westside 'til I die)\nNiggas pourin' out that (Olde English)\n\n[Verse 1:The Game]\nOnce upon a time in the projects, yo\nI watched my Uncle Greg put D's on a '6-4\nI washed it on Monday so he bought me a gold chain\nChopped crack and watched \"Colors\" so I soaked up game\nDrove the Impala on his lap, that was my role model\nUsed to let me kill the corner of his 40 ounce bottle\nOn the weekend him and my Pops flashed a 'Vette\nTil' one weekend my Uncle got stabbed to death\nHe got murdered by a fiend, my Pops ain't like that\nHe was from Nutty Block, they used to call him Maniac\nCrazy ass nigga, with a Black Panther tat'\nKill a nigga, cross him out on his Compton hat\nTold me when I got older, I would understand that\nIt's blood in, blood out and ain't no turnin' back\nFew summers went by and we moved across the tracks\n13, that's when I had my first (Olde English)\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2:The Game]\nI was the first nigga with a Starter jacket on the block\nUsed to build model cars and make the motherfuckers hop\nMoms banged Hoover Crip, she was known for sellin' rocks\nLet me collect the 40 ounce bottles in the dope spot\nBought my first Converse, thought I couldn't be stopped\nWhen I creased up my khakis and threw on my Ronnie Lott\nUsed to think that I was hard, so I stole my brothers Glock\nAnd that's the day my life changed cause that night he got shot\nKilled by another Crip over his Rolex watch\nI got high for three years off that \"Chronic\" from the Doc\nI was drinkin' 40 ounces a lot\nAnd every liquor store in Compton sold out the day Eazy dropped\nI start bangin' red laces in my a-di-das\nDrinkin' out a brown paper bag on my first drive-by\nI was a menace to society\nBut I never left finger prints on my (Olde English)\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3:The Game]\nI got a lot of dead homies, some Blood some Crip\nThis is life, stop watchin' that \"Boyz N The Hood\" shit\nYou see this red rag hangin' outta my jeans\nI went to 20 funerals by the age of 19\nThen I went to college, basketball was my dream\nQuit the team, cause I'd rather shoot rock with the fiends\nWanted to be Freeway Rick\nHe showed me how to turn a stolen 5.0 into a brick\nBought a Cadillac, thought I was rich, bangin' DJ Quik\nOn Crenshaw got jacked for my shit\nTook a long chronic hit, and thought about the time\nWhen I was 12 years old and I emptied my first clip\nHit my first switch, same night fucked my first bitch\nThought I was dreamin 'til I pinched her tits\nShe caught a stray bullet ridin' shotgun in my shit\nSo I got her name tatted in (Old English)\n\n[Hook]", "image":

English)\n\n[Verse 1:The Game]\nOnce upon a time in the projects, yo\nI watched my Uncle Greg put D's on a '6-4\nI washed it on Monday so he bought me a gold chain\nChopped crack and watched \"Colors\" so I soaked up game\nDrove the Impala on his lap, that was my role model\nUsed to let me kill the corner of his 40 ounce bottle\nOn the weekend him and my Pops flashed a 'Vette\nTil' one weekend my Uncle got stabbed to death\nHe got murdered by a fiend, my Pops ain't like that\nHe was from Nutty Block, they used to call him Maniac\nCrazy ass nigga, with a Black Panther tat'\nKill a

banged Hoover Crip, she was known for sellin' rocks\nLet me collect the 40 ounce bottles in the dope spot\nBought my first Converse, thought I couldn't be stopped\nWhen I creased up my khakis and threw on my Ronnie Lott\nUsed to think that I was hard, so I stole my brothers Glock\nAnd that's the day my life changed cause that night he got shot\nKilled by another Crip over his Rolex watch\nI got high for three years off that \"Chronic\" from the Doc\nI was drinkin' 40 ounces a lot\nAnd every liquor store in Compton sold out the day Eazy dropped\nI start bangin' red laces in my a-di-das\nDrinkin' out a brown paper bag on my first drive-by\nI was a menace to society\nBut I never left finger prints on my (Olde English)\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3:The Game]\nI got a lot of dead homies, some Blood some Crip\nThis is life, stop watchin' that \"Boyz N The Hood\" shit\nYou see this red rag hangin' outta my jeans\nI went to 20 funerals by the age of 19\nThen I went to college, basketball was my dream\nQuit the team, cause I'd rather shoot rock with the fiends\nWanted to be Freeway Rick\nHe showed me how to turn a stolen 5.0 into a brick\nBought a Cadillac, thought I was rich, bangin' DJ Quik\nOn Crenshaw got jacked for my shit\nTook a long chronic hit, and thought about the time\nWhen I was 12 years old and I emptied my first clip\nHit my first switch, same night fucked my first bitch\nThought I was dreamin 'til I pinched her tits\nShe caught a stray bullet ridin' shotgun in my shit\nSo I got her name tatted in (Old English)\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "The Good,

gotta stay here?\n\n[Verse 1]\nThere was money on the table with the bricks\nI was in the living room feeling on this bitch\nHeard my car alarm going off on my 6\nSo my dogs start barking and some niggas hit the fence\nSo I take my dick out this bitch mouth and walked to the window\nPull the blinds down and took one hit of the Indo\nYou niggas ain't doing shit, but stealing my neighbors rims so\nWalked back to the couch and told the bitch to bend over\nThat's what I'm rolling with...\nNah, I ain't saying shit and I ain't snitching on nobody\nYeah, that's my four-five, but it ain't got no bodies\nAnd two dead niggas? Them is nobody\nThey shoulda torched 'em, then you wouldn't had no bodies\nI mean look at these pictures, just so sloppy\nCouldn't have been me, I do my shit like John Gotti\nFeed the nigga to the sharks after dark\nMan, fuck this shit I thought I told y'all\n\n[Verse 2]\nThere was money on the table by the bricks\nI was at the kitchen table chopping up some shit\nListening to Jeezy and I heard a little *bullet sound*\nSo I turned the radio down and cocked my four-fif'\nOh shit... Am I hit? Nah, just a hole in my Jordan fitted\nSo I turn down all the lights and cock my four-fif'\nSeen some niggas jump in they Escalade and that was it\nHow much longer I gotta stay in this mothafucka? Let me get a cigarette\nI don't even smoke but shit, y'all got a nigga stressed\nI gotta stay in this mothafucka 'til I confess?\nShit, y'all bitches better get some rest\nCause it'll be a cold day in Miami\n'fore I snitch on myself or the hood, you understand me?\nYeah, I fuck with the Bulls but I ain't Sammy\nNiggas run around the hood singing, they should get a Grammy\nAnd you two mothafuckas should get an Oscar\nWith this good-cop-bad-cop shit, take me to process\nCause I don't eat breakfast with no pigs\nI watched First 48 so fuck your 25 years\nNo evidence, no bid\nI don't know who split them niggas' wigs\n\n[Outro]\nAlready told y'all, there was money on the table with the bricks\nI was walking to the bathroom to take a shit\nThen I heard my dogs barking, there's some noise by the fence\nSo I ran to my room and reached for the four-fif'\nThen I seen three niggas by my back door\nLooked out the bathroom window and seen two more\nSo I reached for my chopper and some clips out the drawer\nGuess I had to welcome niggas to the gun store"}}, {"title": "Last Time You Seen", "album": "The Documentary 2.5", "year": "2015-10-16", "lyrics": "[Hook: Game]\nWhen the last time you seen 2Pac?\nWhen the last time you seen 2Pac?\nWhen the last time you seen 2Pac?\nWhen the last time you seen 2Pac?\n\n[Verse 1: Game]\nI know who killed Pac, nigga\nThe police know who killed Pac, nigga\nSuge Knight know who killed Pac, nigga\nHe died at the car wash, the world heard the shots, nigga\nThen they killed Biggie, he just came through to visit\nRampart division, Pirus ain't had nothing to do with it\nSo many niggas in caskets, then turned ashes\nSome get shot, some Hussein Fatal in car crashes\nI think it's a conspiracy theory, Illuminati\nHow Pac died and two months later they killed Kadafi\nThen they killed Buntry Al and Heron, they getting sloppy\nLAPD, these niggas worse than the Nazis\nAnd Pac was only 25, thuggin' as a youngin'\nSitting shotgun, I wonder if he seen them shots coming\nGuess it don't matter, all the niggas buried, though\nWouldn't have never happened if Suge kept it real with Harry-O\n\n[Interlude: Harry-O]\n\"The way I look at it is like this, even me man, coming up in that game, right. I came up in that game, man, and I was blind to a lot of things. And even though I came to jail for some bullshit, I believe that the karma had a lot to do with that. See that's what happened with fat boy when he disrespected me in the game. But I was a good dude in a lot of ways to a lot of people and so a lot of people that crossed me in different ways think they gon' have karma. So karma swings for me both ways, what you put out you get back. You put out good shit, you gon' get good shit; it may not always look like it because sometimes there be obstacles in the between. But I done learned 'cause when I was on the street I used to go hard in the paint about different shit. What I learned over the years though is, man, sometimes you ain't gotta be the judge, the jury or the situation 'cause karma gonna handle it\u2019s business 'cause it\u2019s [fair]\"\n\n[Verse 2: Scarface]\nLate night down Sunset, liking the scene\nOn a tour bus in St. Paul, riding to win\nDon't know how it begin, every day was a new\nWhen he was young, living life fast and rhyming his truth\nAnd if crack had took a part of the homies family tree\nThe lil' nigga he was talking 'bout was probably me\nAnd him to know my life story and we not even meet\nWhen we did, it was like we'd known each other for dealing\nWhen the last time I seen him? He was playing his tape\nThat he would later title Makaveli the Great\nSmile for me, yeah, it's strictly for my niggas\nTry to touch money, high on weed and liquor\nHoping God'll forgive us, we been stuck here in the Matrix\nDead before you dishonor a nigga when he face him\nWhatever shit you dealing with, you get you two Glocks\nI guarantee that pussy shit'll stop\nWhen the last time you seen

So karma swings for me both ways, what you put out you get back. You put out good shit, you gon' get good shit; it may not always look like it because sometimes there be obstacles in the between. But I done learned 'cause when I was on the street I used to go hard in the paint about different shit.

lift up)\nTill the motherfucker bounce and break\nAnd knock both of the screws out the licence plate\nLet the games begin\nThese other rap niggas so far behind me, go taste my rims\nShit, let the chronic burn as the Daytons spin\nIt ain\u2019t been this much drama since I first heard Eminem\nIn the club, poppin' X pills like M & Ms\nCall it Dre day, we celebratin', bitch bring a friend\nBottles on me, tell the waiter to order another round\nAnd put that cheap-ass hypnotic down\n(Put your \u2018cris up!)\nIf you feel the same way\nWho got 'em hittin' switches NY to LA\n\n[Hook]\n(If I could fit the whole hood in the club)\nHop in the low-rider, long as you got bitches in the back\n(I turn it into a strip-club)\nCall it a lap-dance, when the six-fo' bounce that

damn, damn, damn\nHeaven\u2019s prays, all I\u2019m tryna do, praise him, praise him\nHeaven\u2019s prays, all I\u2019m wanna do, praise him, my lord\n\n[Verse 1: Game]\nNigga I ain\u2019t pastor Mason yo\nNigga Pat and Ron, peach Ciroc, Ace and y\u2019all\nAnd since I got good taste and all\nThis for all the bad bitches couldn\u2019t wait to get they braces off\nI know we in church, and the way that I\u2019m thinking wrong\nBut inside the bible is the perfect way to sneak my phone\nBut I don\u2019t wanna do that, I came to take the service in\nAnd stare at all the women who brought they Louis purses in\nBad bitches in here, forgive me for my sins\nI ain\u2019t meant to walk inside the church cursing again\nI wanna live righteous and you know I love Jesus\nBut you can\u2019t catch the holy ghost in the Prius\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Game]\nLookin' 'round the church like what that nigga doing here\nHe prolly told on somebody, posed to be doing years\nBut who am I to judge a nigga\nA.R. don\u2019t wanna go to church, I can\u2019t budge the nigga\nBut I love the nigga, so I\u2019mma go for both us\nAnd put these G Star slacks with these Louie loafers\nHe rather sit outside and listen to Hova\nBut the service jumping, the pastor serving my mimosas\nAnd all this ass in here, how do I focus\nCollection plate buldging, damn pastor you the coldest\nMy envelope stay swollen\nSo I\u2019mma count my blessings now, somebody hold this\n\n[Hook]\n\nStaring in the row behind me, man these fat hoes is too cheap\nAin\u2019t paying they tithes, taking up 2 seats\nAnd look at God\u2019s house, pack full of sinners\nWith the sun ride service, now they back for the dinners\nYeah I know the chicken good but your soul ain\u2019t\nAnd your outfit clean but your nose ain\u2019t\nAnd I suppose ain\u2019t nobody a liar in here\nIf that was true, the whole chruch would be on fire in here\nI\u2019m sure glad we have a choir in here\nTo wake me up everytime I get tired in here\nAnd one thing\u2019s for sure, gotta praise the Lord\nCause when I went to Undefeated, they still had my fours\nFell to the floor like\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "Dollar and a Dream", "album":

Town niggas gon' ride tonight\nThey say them Tree Top niggas gon' ride tonight\nThey say them Grape Street niggas gon' ride tonight\nThey say them Bounty Hunter niggas gon' ride tonight\nThey say them 6-0 niggas gon' ride tonight\nThey say them Cedar Block niggas gon' ride tonight\nThem 1-9-0 niggas gon' ride tonight\nThey say them Denver Lane niggas gon' ride tonight\nThey say them Campanella niggas gon' ride tonight\nWho gon' ride tonight, who gon' die tonight\nStarted with a dollar and a dream\nStarted with a dollar and a dream\n\n[Verse 1: The Game]\nWe did it for the West, motherfucker, like Kanye\nNiggas get stretched out on La Cienega\nGot three thousand stacks, I ain't talking 'bout Andre\nI put it on your head, I ain't talking no toupee\nSee I stayed the same, ain't go weird like Lupe\nSqueeze on this trigger like ain't no more toothpaste\n(You ain't gon' do shit) Bitch, of course I is\nYou want this money, you gon' have to drive the course I did\nI got that Wraith out, you talking 'bout the Porsche out here\nYou in the nosebleeds, come down to where the courtside is\nHow a nigga with a rojo rag end up in Soho\nBag, any bitch walking with a solo swag\nYou think you ballin' in that four do' Jag? Nah\nIn Tom Fords with a MK bag? nah\nGive you a bird's eye view of the streets\nNigga, welcome to Compton, take you to Carson next week\nAb-Soul!\n\n[Hook: The Game]\nStarted with a dollar and a dream and a pistol\nOn the corner rag hangin', slangin' crystal\nI said you gangbanging let me see credentials\nAnd when I pull this gun out you know how this go\nStarted with a dollar and a dream!\n(Look at me now, look at me now)\nStarted with a dollar and a dream!\n\n[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]\nI was fathered by the bastards\nPardon my mannerisms\nThe Curtiss magnet that managed without the metal with him\nHow the hell I did it? I let God ad lib it\nI put that on Leetwood, I ain\u2019t lying one sentence\nBitch, I started with a dollar and a dream\nWe went from helping old ladies with their groceries at Alpha Beta\nFor a  couple quarters to a baby hustling something major\nWe had to grow up sooner or later, but\nI\u2019m so Del Amo, my mama still stay off Anna Lee\nCarson across my belly, I prove you lost already\nRoccett my big brother, Bishop let the door crack\nGame took me on my first tour, now look where we at\nIn the studio getting paid to reflect on that\nDocumenting true facts\nNot to mention this the Documentary 2, too\nYou do the addition in ballerina shoes\nEnough with the clever raps, it\u2019s more important than that\nI put my city on the map, nigga\nYeah, I really put my city on the map\nI mean, when the last time you heard Carson on the track, nigga?\nLet alone when they calling out stomping grounds on the West\nI\u2019ll wait\nYeah, that\u2019s what I thought, I\u2019m the best, nigga\nThis the new West, nigga, respect that\nIt\u2019s Top Dawg, all I\u2019m missing is the red hat\nBut don\u2019t question what pocket I had left, my handkerchief\nI\u2019m guilty by affiliation, in many ways gangsta\nBut let me explain something, a paradox if you may\nI threw all on fresh Supreme Chuck Taylors today\nAnd then I got a call from Chuck Taylor, I\u2019m saying\nThe game ain\u2019t changed, we still changing the game\nSoul!\n\n[Hook: Game]\nStarted with a dollar and a dream and a pistol\nOn the corner rag hangin', slangin' crystal\nI said you gangbanging let me see credentials\nAnd when I pull this gun out you know how this go\nStarted with a dollar and a dream!\n(Look at me now, look at me now)\nStarted with a dollar and a dream!\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nMy first album was a set up\nI was the little nigga Pac was talking to\nWhen he said \"keep your head up\"\nCause he knew what I would be facing after his demise\nJayceon had to pitch them pies, better life than flipping fries\nI'm the one the Crips despise\nMove the Yay or kiss the sky, for having dreams that 50 died\nEulogy by Mary Blige\nHopped up in that enterprise, had to stop a genocide\nWent from underdog to watching Top Dawg and Kendrick rise\nNow tell me can I testify, pull over trying to rest for 5\nOn a block, no tint on the Wraith left these kids mesmerized\nThey ask me how I did it, how I got it\nSay I'm king you looking brolic\nI put them weights down start practicing lyrical exercise\nTell me who the next to die, probably who the next in line\nThey got me battling ghost cause I'm the illest one alive\nThat's word to Pac, Pun, Biggie, why I stand as my city\nIf we was bout to run a train, you couldn't fuck with me\nEver since I saved my coast, it's been born again\nIf I ain't shit then who the king of California then?\nWho could out-rap me?\nNow think about if the same nigga you bout to say can run up and out-strap me, yeah\nOut-trap me, yeah, out-gat me\nI mean think about it, exactly\nSpeaking matter-of-factly I'm down playing that actually\nCall me Game I ain't one still I get paid like an athlete\nDo the math after the math, Doc two in the bag\nLived up to expectations, Dre took me first in the draft\nNow who the fuck want what\nNobody survives so look alive when them Impalas in the cut\n\n[Hook: Game]\nStarted with a dollar and a dream and a pistol\nOn the corner rag hangin', slangin' crystal\nI said you gangbanging let me see credentials\nAnd when I pull this gun out you know how this go\nStarted with a dollar and a dream!\n(Look at me

and give me head like it's '94\nAnd don't come up for air 'til the beat drop\nI'm the Doctor's Advocate\nCall it a sneak peak at the motherfucking \"Detox\"\nTake note, grab a pen\nAnd let the world know the West is ridin' again\nI graduated from Dre school, top of my class\nTreat my switches like my bitches, got 'em droppin' that ass\nStill bangin' The Chronic like Doggystyle came with it\nAnd I roll up sticky on my bitch back while I hit it\nI done Been There, Done That, had beefs and won that\n5 million records on one plaque, I hung that\nStill got Dr. Dre lowridin' in the '6-4\nWhen you see us throw it up for the fucking\n(West Coast)\n\n[Hook: Snoop Dogg + (Xzibit)]\nMy heart beat for the (West Coast)\nWe grow the best weed on the (West Coast)\nWe lowride on the (West Coast)\nSo I'mma die throwing up the (West Coast)\nMy heart beat for the (West Coast)\nWe grow the best weed on the (West Coast)\nStill lowridin' on the (West Coast)\nYou should take a trip and visit the (West Coast)\n\n[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]\nCheck game, I'mma show you how to bang\nUncle Snoopy is it true you from that 20 gang?\nAll the time neph', I gotta let my nuts hang\nA chest full of chains, left hand with a pinky ring\nI'm in a Steeler cap, Swisher Sweet peel 'em back\nMy lil' hoodrat, baby got that mini mac\nBaby got that twenty sack, baby got plenty that\nWhatever you send us my nucca, we gon' send it back\nI'm in the club with the snub gettin' love\nWith 20,000 Crips and 20,000 Bloods and\nWe don't give a fuck about none of y'all\nAnd when you hit the city, you better holla at the Bigg Dogg\nI done seen niggas hit L.A. and get they chain snatched\nThen they call me up beggin' me to get they chain back\nWhat I look like, the motherfuckin' police?\nThere's certain rules you got to follow when you in these streets\nEspecially when it comes to this Cali shit\nAnd I ain't talkin' bout hangin' in the valley bitch\nGangbang niggas all up in the alley, Crip\nOn some real talk nigga we the real ones\n(West Coast)\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Xzibit]\nI heard the blue rag niggas ain't fucking\nWith the red rag niggas on the West Coast (Fuck you mean?)\nShit, from what I seen, red and blue can make green\nBlack Wall Street and X only\nSince jealousy breeds hatred, hatred breeds violence\nViolence breeds enemies, more permanent silence\nCalifornia alliance, it's more important than ever\nSo throw it up, we lowridin' together (yeah!)\nMake the West Coast rise forever\nEses, Bs and Cs represent your letter\nGot Game the go-getter, Xzibit the rhyme spitter\nSnoop Dogg the boss, we gangsta at all costs\nY'all niggas is so soft and pussy so fuck off\n'Fore one of my niggas draw that hammer and dump off\nIt's kush, you gon' cough {*cough-cough*}\nYeah, inhale the smoke\nBandana hang, bang the Coast my nigga\n(West Coast)\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8733b8e495bb8c50e53cd1da0aada2cb.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "The Game", "raw": {"annotation_count": 15,

high\nI would be broke, if I would be with you\nThat is why it's fo' one night\n\n[Verse 1: The Game]\nI'm a motherfucking gangbanging nightmare, wake up motherfuckers\nI traded in my white Nike Airs\nFor a red pair of Converse, back to the hood\nMy own niggas acting like I turned my back on the hood\nI used my rap money to put crack in the hood\nEven brought the nigga Dr. Dre back to the hood\nI showed niggas the Bentley then let you drive it\nGone for two days and I ain't even check the mileage\nWhen we was fighting with Crips it wasn't about no dollars\nIt was about selling dope to put our kids through college\nI'm sitting on the block, reminiscing for hours\nWiping my tears cause now half of my niggas is cowards\nAnd I was still fuckin with niggas\nAfter I got shot and didn't get one hospital visit\nMy homey Snoop told me it'd be days like this\nIt hurt my heart, to say this shit\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: The Game]\nRed bandana in my back pocket, I'm for real\nThis ain't a pastel color khaki suit, and I ain't Pharrell\nI don't front about shit I pull my gun up out shit\nAnd let everything fly to keep my son up outta this\nI thought you loved me nigga, talk is cheap\nRemember, the bulletholes in my son's car seat\nMy baby momma found four shells\nI ain't get one \"keep your head up,\" all I got was \"keep it real\"\n'Keep it real' my niggas?\nLast year alone I spent one point five mill' on my niggas\nAfter the bullshit, I stayed right there\nTook you to award shows, there go Jay right there, where? Right there!\nI had all you niggas in suits, cleaner than a pair of fresh Nike Airs\nI'm supposed to enjoy this shit but it's quite clear\nThe last twelve months been a fucking nightmare\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nThis shit worse than arguing with my bitch\nI done been through mo' ups and downs, than the Impala switch\nGet yo hand out my pocket nigga, go fish\nI was born by myself so I don't owe y'all shit\nNigga you tell me, what you want me to do\nDrop my son off at home and come bang wit'chu?\nOh now it's fuck Game, nah nigga fuck you\nI put that on my life, matter fact, that's on Piru\nAnd the reality is, I could die too\nAnd end up in the cemetery, right beside you, we can both rot\nAngels flying over my headstone, but the devils inside yo' box\nYou wanted my shine so I gave you ice\nThen I gave you a second chance and you played me twice\nCouldn't be a real homeboy to save yo' life\nI shoulda took Dr. Dre's advice\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro: Andrea Martin]\nBlack Wall Street fo' life\nOnly fuck with you on two occasions\nWhen I'm out of my mind, or when I'm high\nI only, fuck with you..."}}, {"title": "Uncle Otis", "album": "Hoodmorning (No Typo): Candy Coronas", "year": null, "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nHere's a dome shot to this nigga named Otis\nNiggas think they the coldest but nigga you just the oldest\nNiggas be chasing their youth, but it's gone\nYo, 'Ye, this nigga didn't even want to put you on\nHe turned around, put on Sean\nBut forgot to tell him Beni Han-han, don't sell no fuckin' wontons\nI don't wear Sean John, but I fuck with that C\u00eeroc shit\n2Pac back, well Hit 'Em Up with some Pac shit\n\"Who run the world?\" Jayceon\nYeah, with Kelly Rowland, come and be my motivation\nIf you invented swag, then I invented gangsta\nGot one in the chamber; the throne is now in danger\nAnd I don't wear no Gucci Gucci Fendi Fendi Prada\nI'm Charles Louboutin, you niggas ain't saying nada\nLil white bitch, better stay in your place\nYou call me a nigga, I'mma put the K in your face, this a stick up bitch\n\n[Hook]\nSo put your hands up in the air!\nI just wanna know is any gangstas up in here\nI do it, I do it, boy\n\n[Verse 2]\nCall Khaled tell em \"fuck it I'm on one..\"\nI created Tyler the Creator\nHere go, courtside seats: you are now watching the greatest\nShades blocking the haters, stays rocking the latest\nThe show goes 'til I start aiming the lasers\nAnd Lupe will souffle, half you muther fuckers\nIt's the Drew League, I don't wanna speak about The Rucker\nCause Jennifer Lopez just got a divorce and\nAlready got her up in the Porsche tryna teach you how to love\nMarc Antony too short, look how that nigga look\nMan, I'm \"6 foot, 7 foot, 8 foot..\"\nCrooks and castles, all my niggas crooks with castles\nRed Nation graduation: yeah crooks with tassles\nIt's a party, it's a party it's a party\nSitting up in Marvin's Room, blowing that Marley\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI got the money up in the rubberband\nRun up on me, try to take it from me\nI ain't Morris Chestnut, I ain't Ricky\nBut I give you 9 shots, you can call it 50\nDre got that super bass, I just call it Nicki\nWorking on that Detox, blowing on that sticky\nCan I hit it in the morning?

lasers\nAnd Lupe will souffle, half you muther fuckers\nIt's the Drew League, I don't wanna speak about The Rucker\nCause Jennifer Lopez just got a divorce and\nAlready got her up in the Porsche tryna teach you how to love\nMarc Antony too short, look how that nigga look\nMan, I'm \"6 foot, 7 foot, 8 foot..\"\nCrooks and castles, all my niggas crooks with castles\nRed Nation graduation: yeah crooks

the morning? Bet it be a quickie\nGotta hustle hard Ace, Tunechi and Ricky\nWaves Frank Ocean? You could see my odd future\nYou gonna need more than Novacane after I shoot you\nYesterday I went to Coachella, not to see Jigga\nI went to see Wiz, but there's Amber: perfect\nI took a seat on the red futon\nHit it with that Wiz shit on - whatever\nSo put that pussy on my face\nAnd let me taste a little taste\nI'mma eat it up like it's my last\nI'mma do it different, she ain't getting no cash\nYou know why?

Sunday, don't even wipe that pole\nDirty bitch, you done had a dick in every one of your holes\nYou a trick, you ain't shit and everybody knows\nBitch you don't even wash your rag\nLet a nigga smash and you don't even wash your ass\nFuck you mean? You 'bout to go home and take a shower\nThat mean that pussy 'bout to be funky for a whole 'nother hour\nEvery night you let a new nigga nut in your shit\nHow you suck a nigga's dick with that cut on your lip?\nYou freak bitch, your baby daddy in the county doin' burpies\nAnd you gave that nigga herpes\n\n[Hook]\nBitch you ain't shit, bitch you ain't shit\nBitch you ain't shit, bitch you ain't shit\nEverybody knows\nBitch you ain't shit, bitch you ain't shit\nBitch you ain't shit, everybody knows\nEverybody knows, everybody knows\nBitch you ain't shit\nEverybody knows, everybody knows\nBitch you ain't shit\n\n[Verse 2]\nBitches ain't shit but hoes and sluts\nShe asked to hold 500, I let her hold deez nuts\nBitch what? You fuckin' niggas when you got cramps\nTalkin' bout eat these groceries, bitch you on food stamps\nYou gotta watch these hoes, they get your ass splattered homie\nNever trust a bitch if she got the hood tattered on her\nBrother, he a gunner, got an uncle from the hunnaz\nTwo baby daddies, one from the 60s and one from the Jungles\nMake it even worse, her whole family's full of killers\nAfter the funeral she right back to the followers and filters\nShe got a Range and a Benz\nDoin' credit card schemes with her ratchet ass friends\nBitch just stole a TV from Target\nYellin' at her kids while Joseline and Stevie be arguin'\nShe blocked from Drizzy's page now she all on my dick\nI hit her with a hashtag like (Bitch you ain't shit)\n\n[Hook]\nBitch you ain't shit, bitch you ain't shit\nBitch you ain't shit, bitch you ain't shit\nEverybody knows\nBitch you ain't shit, bitch you ain't shit\nBitch you ain't shit, everybody knows\nEverybody knows, everybody knows\nBitch you ain't

aftermath\nNow when I said we gonna let this motherfucker breathe\nI meant this motherfucking beat is dead\nWere gonna preform CPR to bring that motherfucker back to life\nNow let that motherfucker breathe\n\n[Hook]\nCompton's my city, that motherfucker ain't never pretty\nGave Pac life, them motherfuckers that killed Biggie\nThem motherfuckers that killed Biggie\nThem motherfuckers that killed Biggie\n\n[Verse 1]\nNotoriouses, bring that Benz in\nI'm about a dollar, nigga fuck 50 Cent\nI heard Tony Yayo can't pay the rent\nI heard Lloyd Banks can't pay the rent\nI beat the G-Unit out of 40 Glocc\nSue me for forty grand, that same forty will get you shot\nIPhone in my hand doing the forty whop\nThat nigga looked up and thought he saw 40 Pacs\nLooking out of my window I see forty cops\nTrying to serve me that subpoena, I'm on this Xbox\n2 Chainz voice, smoking that Wiz Khalifa\nPass to Waka Flocka, let me spit this ether\nYeah let me spit this ether\nYeah yeah yeah, 'til it blow the speaker\nFrom eating Reese's Pieces to pulling guns out\nFor that Little Caesar's Pizza\nAll the way to jacking niggas for their Jesus pieces\nI'm God to you bitch ass niggas put that on Matthew, Paul and Peter\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nFuck with me, fuck with me\nFuck with me, nigga you stuck with me\nForever and ever and ever\nShyne Po ain't rich, Shyne po'\nAll the way in Belize with Kendrick's dick in his throat\nGood kid, mad city, mad kid, bad city\nNothing from Compton could ever be trash\nYou hear that nigga voice sound like a dick in his ass\nHe reminiscing, a Compton nigga's bitch in prison\nUsed to be Christian, now that nigga Jew\nCan't step foot in America so what he gon' do\nP.Diddy's stuntman, Jackie Chan your ass through\nHood pass revoked, get your fucking brains blew\nBlood on that yarmulke, now you really Piru\nSoon as they killed Biggie that man became you\nBut you couldn't become him cause you were shooting at the roof\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro]\nI always wondered why Puff wasn't in that truck\nI said I always wondered why Puff wasn't in that truck\nLet that bitch breathe, let that bitch breathe\nThis my motherfucking city\nFive motherfucking albums\nThe Documentary, classic\nDoctor's Advocate, classic\nEverything in between that shit and Jesus piece, classic\nThem mufuckin grams, [?]\nChop it up, rock it up\nDo whatever the fuck you gotta do to get yo muthafuckin paper\nShoutout to my nigga Dr. Dre\nHe ain't ever gotta put out Detox, now that he got me and fucking Kendrick\nAnd them muthafuckin Dre Beats you got on yo muthafuckin

and this barrel so loooong\nLike Pinocchio's nose my list of foes grows\nCasket closed, air tight like Mystikal's cornrows\nExpose rap niggas, take hoes from rap niggas\nNever said shit when they seen me, get your toe tag nigga\nThe Compton lyricist, you niggas can't get with this\nUsed to tap Dre on the shoulder like, \"Nigga come hear this shit\"\nHe thinkin' he slick and shit, nigga sweeter than licorice\nLos Angeles god, we mob like Infamous\nAin't from Queensbridge or Brooklyn but we done shook ones\nBullets, I done took some, crack, I done cook some\nDon't you stand there and look dumb\nAin't no honor amongst thieves, especially when the hook come lives, I done took some\n\n[Hook: Sha Sha]\nWhen I look around I hear something tell me\nThat I\u2019m the type of nigga you could

long way home\nMy finger itchin' and this barrel so loooong\nLike Pinocchio's nose my list of foes grows\nCasket closed, air tight like Mystikal's cornrows\nExpose rap niggas, take hoes from rap niggas\nNever said shit when they seen me, get your toe tag nigga\nThe Compton lyricist, you niggas can't get with this\nUsed to tap Dre on the shoulder like, \"Nigga come hear this shit\"\nHe thinkin' he slick and shit, nigga sweeter than licorice\nLos Angeles god, we mob like Infamous\nAin't from Queensbridge or Brooklyn but we done shook ones\nBullets, I done took some, crack, I done cook some\nDon't you stand there and look dumb\nAin't no honor amongst thieves, especially when the hook come lives, I done took some\n\n[Hook: Sha Sha]\nWhen I look around I hear something tell me\nThat I\u2019m the type of nigga you could be down for\nAnd I be hearing niggas say they gon\u2019 kill me\nAnd be the type of niggas I think I should make a move on\nBut I came to let you know I keep that heat for real\n\n[Verse 2: Game]\nI kicks in doors when your rap bars is Iggy\nI pull up floors and take them charges with me\nAventador as I explore the city\nPhillipe's with my henchmen, nigga, word to Jimmy\nYou could be swimmin\u2019 in the Hudson, it\u2019s nothin\u2019\nThink I\u2019m bluffin\u2019?

I'm po'd up\nWe out here killing each other, but so what?\nKeep it up and there's gon' be no Crips and no Bloods\nNigga take a look around, the crack game has slowed up\nThe government versus the people, now tell me\nWho rules the world with only one desire?\nI don't believe there's anything higher\nRather get it now than to read about the outcome\nI'd rather have the crown, than a ribbon or medallion\nAnd oh my days, I guess it's okay\nIf I lay up in the shade when my rent is in the mattress\nBut be at the course if I have to use patience\nI'm shooting a premature dream in the napkin\nBattling the evils in the flesh that I'm wrapped in\nWaiting for my eagle, but the seagulls are distracting\n\n[Bridge 1: Anderson .Paak]\nWhat's happening, niggas? Mm\nWhat's happening? Hm\nWhat's happening?\nWhat's happening? Mm\nWhat's happening?\nMm, yeah\n\n[Verse 2: The Game]\nWhat's happening? My nigga just died from AIDS\nWhat's happening? ISIS throwing grenades\nWhat's happening? White boys shooting up a church\nWhat's happening? My nigga 2-2 just got some work\nWhat's happening? You can get it if you got it, nigga\nBut I ain't got it, nigga, I'm just a solid nigga\nWho run Compton, fuck bitches and flick Impala switches\nEven if I was born blind, you niggas couldn't stop my vision\nRight on time with mine thanks to them old Doc prescriptions\nWest side flourishing again, this what 2Pac envisioned\nObama freeing lifers, that was locked in prison\nEl Chapo said he ran the world, and they forgot to listen\nNot me, nigga, one split second, I say \"Fuck rap\"\nAnd if I ran into El Chapo, he had work as one his captains\nAnd gave me 100 bricks and said \"'Migo, get it bracking\"\nI walk into a Mexican Mafia meeting like\n\n[Bridge 2: Anderson .Paak]\nWhat's happening? Pac's gone, Brenda's still got a baby\nWhat's happening? Lost ones in the land of the crazy\nWhat's happening? You can have a bad bitch in a Mercedes\nBut that don't make your basic ass Beyonc\u00e9 or Jay-Z\nWhat's happening? Obama 'bout to move out the White House\nWhat's happening? Couple hood niggas 'bout to roll them dice out\nWhat's happening? Is you gon' let me use your EBT card? (yeah)\nI wonder if I could slide it for commissary, yah\n\n[Hook: Anderson .Paak]\nAin't it a shame?\nAnother lost one running again\n(You know I bust my thang for you)\nYou do the same old thing that your brothers did before you\nPlanning your whole life under concrete in the soil\nJust a continuation, I wonder where you get your game from\nIf I know anything it's that my old head taught me all alone\nAnd it's a cold game, better get your coat, get your snow chains, man\nIt's a chess game full of kings and pawns\n\n[Break]\nBlack and white squares, just depends what side you on\n(What side is you on?)\nI want a red '64 Impala with them things on it\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nBlack out inside an abandoned crack house\nOnly thing from last night was dead bodies and glass pipes\nThat was the age 4, and by the age 10\nThey opened up the caged doors and let the fucking beast out\nFuck my auntie couch, I'm 'bout to take the street route\nAnd get my shit the gangsta way, cause I can't be no Steve Stoute\nI'm too Nas for these niggas, I got a surprise for these niggas\nPotato cooking on the barrel, I bring the fries to these niggas\nFuneral hall, casket fit to the size of you niggas\nChrome 45, no lie, come say goodbye to you niggas\nSway got all the answers, Kanye lied to you niggas\nI don't even wanna be in no top 5 with you niggas\nI break ties with you niggas, then pay tithes for you niggas\nLos Angeles king, I will no fly zone you niggas\nTake a caravan and Impalas and drive to you niggas\nClose one and aim, Fetty Wap's eye to you niggas\n\n[Hook: Anderson .Paak]\nAin't it a shame?\nAnother lost one running again\n(You know I bust my thang for you)\nYou do the same old thing that your brothers did before you\nPlanning your whole life under concrete in the soil\nJust a continuation, I wonder where you get your game from\nIf I know anything it's that my old head taught me all alone\nAnd it's a cold game, better get your coat, get your snow chains, man\nIt's a chess game full of kings and pawns\n\n[Outro]\nAll I ever wanted was to ride my '64 down 'Shaw\nUh, I'ma spit them verses for my niggas\nDreams coming true, don't it always paint a perfect picture"}}, {"title": "Circles", "album": "The Documentary 2", "year": "2015-10-09", "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Game & Sha Sha]\nI just want you to come home\nNo matter if it's late at night\n(I hear you talking)\nI know you saying you working\nBut baby boy this feeling ain't right\n(I'm just out here tryna get my money you know that)\nFuck that, we got enough houses, enough cars\nYou done bought me enough jewelry\nTired of your shit my nigga, you hear me\n(You know I be at the studio and shit)\nNigga you lying, who you trying to run that game on?\nWho you think I am?

Circles\u201d by Friends of Distinction (1969); Luther Vandross also sampled from this song in his 1994 rendition of \u201cGoing in Circles\u201d\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_agOnKrJ3y0"},

you talking)\nI know you saying you working\nBut baby boy this feeling ain't right\n(I'm just out here tryna get my money you know that)\nFuck that, we got enough houses, enough cars\nYou done bought me enough jewelry\nTired of your shit my nigga, you hear me\n(You know I be at the studio and shit)\nNigga you lying, who you trying to run that game on?\nWho you think I am? I'm not one of these thots you met at Playhouse\n(I didn't say that)\nI just rode by nigga, you wasn't at Drake house\nParked my shit at 'Ye house and hopped in the uber\nJayceon stop lying you fucking think I'm stupid\nNah look, ain't nobody say that\nYou ain't complain when I bought that Maybach\nPut you in Chanel, your friend Chanelle can't even say that\nYou wanted to see Rihanna I put you and your friends at the concert\nCloset full of Giuseppes, you came a long way from Converse\nTook you out that Hon-cord, put you in that Tom Ford\nAll this arguing I ain't got no time for it\nYou call my phone like fifty times\nDon't do no shit like that\nI was just fucking them girls\nI was gon' get right back\n\n[Hook: Eric Bellinger]\nSpinning around, spinning around\nSpinning around, spinning around\nIt's the same old, we be going through the same old\nSpinning around, spinning around\nPulling them down, taking them down\nIt's the same old, niggas get tired of the same old\n\n[Verse 2: Game & Sha Sha]\nNigga you strapping up?\nYeah I'm strapping up, shit, you acting up?\nYeah I'm acting up, nigga\nYou not gon' keep on playing me\nYou not gon' keep on playing me\nIs it gon' be this bitch or your family?\nI'll kill that bitch whole family (I fucking hate you!)\nWhat your crazy ass shooting in the house for?\nWhat yo dumbass screwing in the house for?\nAnd what time you get home anyway?\nShit, about four\nAnd that's what the fuck you sleeping on the couch for\nI don't give a fuck, thug life, I'm an outlaw\nAnd the next bitch ain't nothing but a house call\nScrolling through my iPhone looking for my side chick\nThis bitch always flipping pushing buttons like a sidekick\nThat's when I hop in my Jeep and pull it up to Toxic\nAnd while you gone, guess what?\nI'll be bouncing on that side dick, nigga\n\n[Bridge: Eric Bellinger & Sha Sha]\nI guess you thought they stopped making real niggas when they made you\nI guess you thought they stopped making real niggas when they made you\nI guess you thought they stopped making real niggas when they made you\nShit, they stop making them, they stop making them\nGuess you thought they stopped making real bitches when they made you\nShit, there's a few in the room and a couple in the Wraith too\nBut you know you still the one\n\n[Verse 3: Q-Tip]\nAnd nothing can compare to the temper that you hear\nWhen you get caught in a stare at the next derriere\nNow she's explaining to you\nThat she's the baddest bitch that ever graced a pair of shoes\nAnd if you wanna gamble to find better, you lose\nAnd all this loud chirping that you consider rude\nBut when food is on the table\nWe may be arguing like we Cain and we Abel\nThen we have some makeup love and we get back stable\nHave a little girl, I cut the cord from her navel\nHey\n\n[Outro: Eric Bellinger & Q-Tip]\nI guess it's just the way it goes down\nLove is like a merry go round\nI guess it's just the way it goes down\nLove is like a merry go round\nAnd on goes the game"}}, {"title": "Black On Black", "album": "Blood Moon: Year Of The Wolf ", "year": "2014-09-30", "lyrics": "[Intro: Jeezy & (Game)]\n'Sup, nigga, huh?\nYou know

tell you how a real nigga supposed to bounce back\nSee I left and came back in that black on black\n\n[Verse 1: Game]\nNigga come through for a nine and a half\nI'm a tell him ain't nothin' left\nNigga need an eight, tell him everythin' straight\nAll they gotta do is wait, tell a nigga I'm a chef\nHow you think a nigga went and got that Wraith?\nCould've went to jail but I bought that case\nLawyer came through, told him it's about time\nJim Carrey to the Rollie, I just switch that switch\nPut ten karats on my daughter ear, fuck it\nShe deserved every rock I done sold out in public\nDo anythin' for my Destiny's Child\nShe a Beyonc\u00e9, never be LeToya Luckett\nBlack on black, checkerboard Louis luggage\nOn a PJ feelin' like Warren Buffett\nWith the Minnesota Twins, ain't no Kirby Puckett\nLift the shade, see the clouds, tell Aaliyah that I love her\nBack and forth in a Lear\nMy grandmother say I never see her\nShe want me come home on Thanksgivin'\nPut on some

table, nigga, choppin' my blow up\nSaid she want to sell more like my father\nSame time, had me for a couple dollars\nYeah, I'm 'bout to pull an all nighter\nI'm 'bout to kill these niggas so you might not see me 'til tomorrow\nJust like that, then my palms start itchin'\nSuede hit the block, then my bong gone missin'\nSee, I'm 'bout to take me a trip to the other side of town\nAnd I'm goin' there to find me a chicken\nYeah, I got a nigga in the spot with a nine right now\nSo, I'm goin' there to sell him a pigeon\nMy pastor told me that the money is the root of all evil\nI said if it is, then I losin' my religion\n\n[Bridge: Jeezy]\nIf I had to be precise, tell you two things about life\nNiggas win everyday, niggas fail every night\nI say, \"Now Oprah got a billion dollars and you're nowhere near her\"\nType of shit I tell myself while starin' in the mirror\n\n[Hook: Jeezy]\nEverythin' wrong, this can't be right\nWinning so much, this can't be life (Yeah)\nShit get real, man, you

come through for a nine and a half\nI'm a tell him ain't nothin' left\nNigga need an eight, tell him everythin' straight\nAll they gotta do is wait, tell a nigga I'm a chef\nHow you think a nigga went and got that Wraith?\nCould've went to jail but I bought that case\nLawyer came through, told him it's about time\nJim Carrey to the Rollie, I just switch that switch\nPut ten karats on my daughter ear, fuck it\nShe deserved every rock I done sold out in public\nDo anythin' for my Destiny's Child\nShe a Beyonc\u00e9, never be LeToya Luckett\nBlack on black, checkerboard Louis luggage\nOn a PJ feelin' like Warren Buffett\nWith the Minnesota Twins, ain't no Kirby Puckett\nLift the shade, see the clouds, tell Aaliyah that I love her\nBack and forth in a Lear\nMy grandmother say I never see her\nShe want me come home on Thanksgivin'\nPut on some black on black like here\nBlack on black to my dear\nBlack on black in my ear\nBlack Maserati that I gave to my mama\nRight hand to the father, she can't even find the gears\n\n[Hook: Jeezy]\nEverythin' wrong, this can't be right\nWinning so much, this can't be life (Yeah)\nShit get real, man, you can't hold back\n(Stay on back, nigga, you

'bout to kill these niggas so you might not see me 'til tomorrow\nJust like that, then my palms start itchin'\nSuede hit the block, then my bong gone missin'\nSee, I'm 'bout to take me a trip to the other side of town\nAnd I'm goin' there to find me a chicken\nYeah, I got a nigga in the spot with a nine right now\nSo, I'm goin' there to sell him a pigeon\nMy pastor told me that the money is the root of all evil\nI said if it is, then I losin' my religion\n\n[Bridge: Jeezy]\nIf I had to be precise, tell you two things about life\nNiggas win everyday, niggas fail every night\nI say, \"Now Oprah got a billion dollars and you're nowhere near her\"\nType of shit I tell myself while starin' in the mirror\n\n[Hook: Jeezy]\nEverythin' wrong, this can't be right\nWinning so much, this can't

Gates]\nMayonnaise jar, straight drop, no whippin'\nElectric's off, everything's spoilin' in the fridge\nI ain't bathed in a week, house smellin' like pickles\nStreet showin' no pity, still gettin' to the business\nSafety pin the zip break it down sell nickels\nHad to ball him out of jail, blew the money on the bail\nWent flat, bounced back from a 30-cent flipper\nI don't even know a nigga livin' how I'm livin'\nI don't even know how many times I've been to prison\nShit get gangsta, we call Hot Beezle\nBought two things at the third, I wanna appease you\nTwo-fifty-two on the scale, that's a nina\nEighteen zaps, five hundred-four grams\nAdd an extra gram when you weigh it with the bag\nReal trap talk, keep it real, don't believe you\nWhen you get out of line, swear to God, I'm a leave you\nDicks cut the water 'fore they kick a nigga door\nTried to flush it down the toilet but the dope just float\n(Wooh!) Tear gas from the cannon\nEverybody scramblin', but I ain't never panic\nDouble homicide, broad day, that's my jacket\nTry to bird feed, cut throat, I'mma jack you\nAnd I take change, I'm a serve when they askin'\nCome from out of town, I'mma tax, no relaxin'\n\n[Hook: Jeezy]\nEverythin' wrong, this can't be right\nWinning so much, this can't be life (Yeah)\nShit get real, man, you can't hold back\n(Stay on back, nigga, you gotta do what you gotta do)\nIf he left and came back in that black on black\nI still do it for them niggas with them bricks on bricks\nI still do it for them niggas with them nicks on nicks\nLet me tell you how a real nigga supposed to bounce back\nSee I never came back in that black on black\n\n[Outro: California Dream Taylor (Game's Daughter) & Game]\n(Wolf Howls)\nCalifornia: It's okay, Daddy, I'm not scared\nGame: I know, baby, the rest of the world is\nCalifornia: (Laughs)\nGame: You ready to go home?\nCalifornia: Yes, Daddy\nGame: Let's go\nCalifornia: Okay"}}, {"title": "Born in the Trap", "album": "The R.E.D.

California, nah, it ain't cold as New York\nBut life is a bitch out here: word to Too Short\nWack as a shooter so we called him Tony Kukoc\nGang banging had us addicted like it was Newports\nWhoever thought that it would spread like petroleum\nNow BP connect got us praying to them holy men\nJust had a daughter, almost named her Katrina\nIf I raise her right, then maybe she can take over FEMA\nSpike Lee in New Orleans shooting documentaries\nAnd Game's still in Cali, eatin' off The Documentary\nTake em to the symmetry I mean the cemetery\nWhere everybody boxed in: Refrigerator Perry\n\n[Hook]\nAnd every little fuck up, they blame it on Barack\nCause he's just like T.I.: Born in the Trap\nAnd every little fuck up, they blame it on Barack\nCause he's just like Gucci: Born in the Trap\nAnd every little fuck up, they blame it on Barack\nCause he's just like Jeezy: Born in the Trap\nAnd every little fuck up, my gun she go \"crack!\"\nCause I'm just like Outkast, born in the Trap\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo what's going on with you faggots?\nAnd what you gonna do when your swagger no longer matters?\nAnd your bitch ain't the baddest cause she in her mid-40s\nAnd your Phantom played out so you hating on the shorties\nCause they running around like they was your age, when you was your age\nFucking bitches raw cause now the world ain't got no AIDS\nYeah, 2050 on these niggas\nGolddiggers sucked you dry left hickeys on you niggas\nI used to run around like you, run the town like you\nWalk my red nose and clown like you\nBut it got old like Betty White\nThis rap shit real deep like Barry White\nReminiscing on the days I used to carry white\nWalking though them Crip hoods in the Cherry Nikes\nNow I live a married life, walking in the house, to them home-cooked meals\nJoint American Express accounts and less dollar bills\n\n[Hook]\nNiggas still got their hands out, begging for a stack\nJust like Goodie Mob, I was born in the Trap\nNiggas still got their hands out, begging for a stack\nBut just like Luda, I was born in the Trap\nLeechers still got their hands out, begging for a stack\nBut like Soulja Boy, I was born in the Trap\nBroke ass niggas still begging for a stack\nTake 'em to Shawty Lo, nigga, learn how to Trap\n\n[Verse 3]\nShit deeper than The Roots band\n15's drumming, ?uestlove in the coupe fam\nRiding through Pittsburgh, Wiz got the Steelers\nBorn by the jungle so I came with gorillas\nSince niggas dropping more dimes than we fuckin'\nWe out the hood, tryna get money like P touching\nSplitting backwoods just to get our weed stuffed in\nThe crack we cookin, we don't need ovens\nWe need something to put in the mouth of our kids\nInstead of copping chains, lets fly to Chile and dig\nGo to Haiti and feed, to the Bahamas and breathe\nOn the way back, scoop my nigga Shyne from Belize, you know\nSometimes I feel like this rap shit is heaven sent\nThen I get a high, feel like it's irrelevant\nSo I'm about to pop the trunk like an elephant\nAnd campaign with Wyclef while he run for president\nI'm 'bout to pop the trunk like an elephant\nAnd campaign with Wyclef while he run for president\nTold you I was gonna kill this shit, Premo.."}}, {"title": "Money", "album": "LAX", "year": "2008-08-26", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nKanye told me that \"Jesus Walks\" in '04\nBut I grew up around Impala's and drug lords\nWelcome to Los Angeles, palm trees and drug stores\nAll we know is rocks and presidents like Mount Rushmore\nFuck the police, they hop out and bust doors\nI ain't goin' back to jail, nigga that's what I flush for\nMy money or my Glock, who do I trust more?\nI don't know, it's probably the one that I touch more\nGuess it's the green, cause paper motivate niggas\nAnd my Rolex racist cause it hate niggas\nI used to only sell 8's like that Laker nigga\nNow I'm movin' 24's like I play at the Staples Center\nYou might miss The Game so nigga don't blink\nMy Phantom stand out like Frank Lucas' mink\nSo go ahead and think, like Frank Lucas think\nSomebody'll find your brains on the fuckin' kitchen sink about\n\n[Hook]\nDead presidents, big paper (\"for the money\")\nBenjamins, skyscrapers, my niggas get (\"money\")\nMy bitches get (\"money\") like the strippers get\nFrom the block to the club I'll make it rain (\"money\")\nIn California niggas die (\"for the money\")\nFrom the South to New York, them

Cash Money\nAll the jewelry on your whole crew, that's my tax money\nThat Pablo Escobar crack money\nThat LeBron first Nike contract money\nThat make it rain, all my niggas throw a stack money\nStack it to the ceilin' then call it Shaq money\nThat walk in the club, straight to the back money\nFlavor of Love, Deelishis sittin' on my lap money\nThat rap money, niggas get clapped money\nAir Force One's don't bend when I trap money\nOoooh, I'm Rich like Porter\nHavin' Alpo nightmares whippin' that water\nLike McDonald's, I was flippin' them orders\nIn that '02 Porche truck, whizzin' through borders\nI was through flippin' quarters when I made my first mill'\nI'm about a dollar, 50 Cent ain't real\n\n[Hook]\nDead president, big paper (\"for the money\")\nBenjamins, skyscrapers, my niggas

open them briefcases\nOrder that Patron, tell 'em we want three cases\nFuck a black card, you see these green faces?\nLook at my chest, now you seen Vegas\nTreat my money like the Cristal that we wastin'\nCause I'm a money machine, I could re-make it\nYou a fool thinkin' that Freddy could see Jason\nI've been iced out, like who the fuck need Jacob\nThe doc told me to be patient, but I want\nMoney like Dwight Howard, next time he a free agent\nI'm tryin' to make enough money so I could feed Asia\nHave Asians in the kitchen cookin' in Louis V. aprons\nWord to Martha Stewart, if I could park a Buick\nThen I could flip a Brink's truck, I got the heart to do it\nBall like the nigga Tony Parker do it\nSpeak no Ingles but dinero I talk it fluent\n\n[Hook]\nDead president, big paper

like Mount Rushmore\nFuck the police, they hop out and bust doors\nI ain't goin' back to jail, nigga that's what I flush for\nMy money or my Glock, who do I trust more?\nI don't know, it's probably the one that I touch more\nGuess it's the green, cause paper motivate niggas\nAnd my Rolex racist cause it hate niggas\nI used to only sell 8's like that Laker nigga\nNow I'm movin' 24's like I play at the Staples Center\nYou might miss The Game so nigga don't blink\nMy Phantom stand out like Frank Lucas' mink\nSo go ahead and think, like Frank Lucas think\nSomebody'll find your brains on the fuckin' kitchen sink about\n\n[Hook]\nDead presidents, big paper (\"for the money\")\nBenjamins, skyscrapers, my niggas get (\"money\")\nMy bitches get (\"money\") like the strippers get\nFrom the block to the club I'll make it rain (\"money\")\nIn California niggas die (\"for the money\")\nFrom the South to New York, them bullets fly for the (\"money\")\nDon't stop gettin' (\"money\") It don't matter where you from\nIf you hustle motherfucker keep gettin' that (\"money\")\n\n[Verse 2]\nI get it, that Baby and Slim, Cash Money\nAll the jewelry on your whole crew, that's my tax money\nThat Pablo Escobar crack money\nThat LeBron first Nike contract money\nThat make it rain, all my niggas throw a stack money\nStack it to the ceilin' then call it Shaq money\nThat walk in the club, straight to the back money\nFlavor of Love, Deelishis sittin' on my lap money\nThat rap money, niggas get clapped money\nAir Force One's don't bend when I trap money\nOoooh, I'm Rich like Porter\nHavin' Alpo nightmares whippin' that water\nLike McDonald's, I was flippin' them orders\nIn that '02 Porche truck, whizzin' through borders\nI was through flippin' quarters when I made my first mill'\nI'm about a dollar, 50 Cent ain't real\n\n[Hook]\nDead president, big paper (\"for the money\")\nBenjamins, skyscrapers, my niggas get (\"money\")\nMy bitches get (\"money\") like the strippers get\nFrom the block to the club I'll make it rain (\"money\")\nIn California niggas die (\"for the money\")\nFrom the South to New York, them bullets fly for the (\"money\")\nDon't stop gettin' (\"money\") It don't matter where you from\nIf you hustle motherfucker keep gettin' that (\"money\")\n\n\n[Verse 3]\nSomebody tell Snoop to pop open them briefcases\nOrder that Patron, tell 'em we want three cases\nFuck a black card, you see these green faces?\nLook at my chest, now you seen Vegas\nTreat my money like the Cristal that we wastin'\nCause I'm a money machine, I could re-make it\nYou a fool thinkin' that Freddy could see Jason\nI've been iced out, like who the fuck need Jacob\nThe doc told me to be patient, but I want\nMoney like Dwight Howard, next time he a free agent\nI'm tryin' to make enough money so I could feed Asia\nHave Asians in the kitchen cookin' in Louis V. aprons\nWord to Martha Stewart, if I could park a Buick\nThen I could flip a Brink's truck, I got the heart to do it\nBall like the nigga Tony Parker do it\nSpeak no Ingles but dinero I talk it fluent\n\n[Hook]\nDead president, big paper (\"for the money\")\nBenjamins, skyscrapers, my niggas get (\"money\")\nMy bitches get (\"money\") like the strippers get\nFrom the block to the club I'll make it rain (\"money\")\nIn California niggas die (\"for the money\")\nFrom the South to New York, them bullets fly for the (\"money\")\nDon't stop gettin' (\"money\") It don't matter where you from\nIf you hustle motherfucker keep gettin' that (\"money\")\n\nG-g-g-g-g-get your paper boy\nG-g-g-g-g-get your paper

first I pray yo\nThen I lay low, looking for the halo\nOr more yayo, my little angel\nReminded me to stay playful\nFaithful walks I take in the woods, thinking what's good\nThings that I can change I should\nThings I can't, need to be understood\nTh-this is the bliss, I used to drift from the hood\nFor a second at least, I'm resurrecting the peace\nPipes that Indians used to light, we called it Chief, right?\nStepping on the leafs right to reach heights\nTh-th-th-that I never seen, it's so so evergreen\nSome use it for medicine, or to write better things\nI was in Amsterdam man, bike pedalling\nTo the nature spot to taste the flavors they got\nMy eyes drop, I like it a lot\nYeah, my angel\n\n[Hook]\nI wanna turn up the sound and spread my wings\nBecause I'm riding with my (angel)\nGoing through the city of the Chi\nMakes me feel like I'm in the city of (angels)\nOhh, I wanna fly, fly away with my (angel)\nShe takes me high, she will always be my (angel)\n\n[Verse 2: The Game]\nTh-th-the way that I rhyme blow nigga's mind\nLike the first time you heard Mary J. and you were standing in line\nTo purchase tickets to see her blow like Chicago wind\nAnd I'm ridin with Common looking for Chicago Zen\nAnd like Chicago winds, I was once a Street Disciple\nRockin every Jordan shoe, Nike put out by Michael\nThat made me feel like I could fly, sometimes I wanted to die\nProlly cause the angel dust was fuckin with my third eye\nSo I start hip-hop and I understand why Common used to love her\nShe got me open so I even had to fuck her\nBut I used the rubber, cause she was married to Rakim\nSo I bought me a gold chain, pretendin' that I was him\nSo I can get close to the girl I loved the most\nBut she left Cali and went on tour with Ne-Yo and Ghost\nBig gave her one more chance and she took Big down\nI should've knew when Shock G and Pac told me she get around\nAn angel\n\n[Hook]\nI wanna turn up the sound and spread my wings\nBecause I'm riding with my (angel)\nGoing through the city of the Chi\nMakes me feel like I'm in the city of (angels)\nOhh, I wanna fly, fly away with my (angel)\nShe takes me high, she will always be my (angel)\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nFly away, fly away\nMy love for her is not about jewelry and cars\nI love her cause she love me, just for who I are\nWho I is, who I am, resembles the rims on the Lam'\nI shine like Shyne when Barrington Levy was sayin\n\"Didilly whoooa!\", I got love for the streets\nPeace to New York and every hood in the East\nBefore I was duckin' cops, gunshots\nI used to be an L.A. Dodger, now I'm a (angel)\nFrom the city of lost souls, Impalas and polished gold\nBetween the car and the rims, we got a lot of chrome\nYour hood not alone, they knockin, we not at home\nAnd when they bust in, we not Caesar, but gotta roam\nCause they try to wire phones, I'm talking Verizon phones\nThe ones they put wires on, they got us on tap\nBut I put wires on, my Bentley in fact\nI spit it through the wires on a Kanye track\n\n[Hook]\nI wanna turn up the sound and spread my wings\nBecause I'm riding with my (angel)\nGoing through the city of the Chi\nMakes me feel like I'm in the city of (angels)\nOhh, I wanna fly, fly away with my (angel)\nShe takes me high, she will always be my (angel)\n\n[Outro: Common]\nYeah, it's The Game and Common\nSpread your wings, follow your dreams\nThings will be so serene\nL.A. and the Chi is a team\nYeah, angel supreme, yeah, keep on\nYeah, it's for the world boy\nWe do it forever, yeah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bba1920bee43a618432ce43748293ec6.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "The Game", "raw": {"annotation_count": 14, "api_path": "/songs/44984", "apple_music_id": "288649643", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/44984/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "Common and Game rapping about their angels.

first I pray yo\nThen I lay low, looking for the halo\nOr more yayo, my little angel\nReminded me to stay playful\nFaithful walks I take in the woods, thinking what's good\nThings that I can change I should\nThings I can't, need to be understood\nTh-this is the bliss, I used to drift from the hood\nFor a second at least, I'm resurrecting the peace\nPipes that Indians used to light, we called it Chief, right?\nStepping on the leafs right to reach heights\nTh-th-th-that I never seen, it's so so evergreen\nSome use it for medicine, or to write better things\nI was in Amsterdam man, bike pedalling\nTo the nature spot to taste the flavors they got\nMy eyes drop, I like it a lot\nYeah, my angel\n\n[Hook]\nI wanna turn up the sound and spread my wings\nBecause I'm riding with my (angel)\nGoing through the city of the Chi\nMakes me feel like I'm in the city of (angels)\nOhh, I wanna fly, fly away with my (angel)\nShe takes me high, she will always be my (angel)\n\n[Verse 2: The Game]\nTh-th-the way that I rhyme blow nigga's mind\nLike the first time you heard Mary J. and you were standing in line\nTo purchase tickets to see her blow like Chicago wind\nAnd I'm ridin with Common looking for Chicago Zen\nAnd like Chicago winds, I was once a Street Disciple\nRockin every Jordan shoe, Nike put out by Michael\nThat made me feel like I could fly, sometimes I wanted to die\nProlly cause the angel dust was fuckin with my third eye\nSo I start hip-hop and I understand why Common used to love her\nShe got me open so I even had to fuck her\nBut I used the rubber, cause she was married to Rakim\nSo I bought me a gold chain, pretendin' that I was him\nSo I can get close to the girl I loved the most\nBut she left Cali and went on tour with Ne-Yo and Ghost\nBig gave her one more chance and she took Big down\nI should've knew when Shock G and Pac told me she get around\nAn angel\n\n[Hook]\nI wanna turn up the sound and spread my wings\nBecause I'm riding with my (angel)\nGoing through the city of the Chi\nMakes me feel like I'm in the city of (angels)\nOhh, I wanna fly, fly away with my (angel)\nShe takes me high, she will always be my (angel)\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nFly away, fly away\nMy love for her is not about jewelry and cars\nI love her cause she love me, just for who I are\nWho I is, who I am, resembles the rims on the Lam'\nI shine like Shyne when Barrington Levy was sayin\n\"Didilly whoooa!\", I got love for the streets\nPeace to New York and every hood in the East\nBefore I was duckin' cops, gunshots\nI used to be an L.A. Dodger, now I'm a (angel)\nFrom the city of lost souls, Impalas and polished gold\nBetween the car and the rims, we got a lot of chrome\nYour hood not alone, they knockin, we not at home\nAnd when they bust in, we not Caesar, but gotta roam\nCause they try to wire phones, I'm talking Verizon phones\nThe ones they put wires on, they got us on tap\nBut I put wires on, my Bentley in fact\nI spit it through the wires on a Kanye track\n\n[Hook]\nI wanna turn up the sound and spread my wings\nBecause I'm riding with my (angel)\nGoing through the city of the Chi\nMakes me feel like I'm in the city of (angels)\nOhh, I wanna fly, fly away with my (angel)\nShe takes me high, she will always be my (angel)\n\n[Outro: Common]\nYeah, it's The Game and Common\nSpread your wings, follow your dreams\nThings will be so serene\nL.A. and the Chi is a team\nYeah, angel supreme, yeah, keep on\nYeah, it's for the world boy\nWe do it forever, yeah"}}, {"title": "Better Days", "album": "Better Days - Single", "year": null, "lyrics": "[Hook: Andre Merrit]\nBeen holding this pain inside for so long\nThough the rain never goes away\nThey say I should leave these streets behind me\nBut it's so hard to escape\nOh Lord please send me an angel\nTo lead me out of this place\nTake me away, away\nFar away, to better days\n\n[Verse 1: The Game]\nFirst thing I wanna do is say \"What up\" to T.I\nKing of the south, now everybody see why\nI'm just driving and thinking how I survived here\nAnd I ain't seen Dre and Eminem in five years\nThat sound Shady right, I live a crazy life\nSo many black thoughts I had to paint the Mercedes white\nI could tell you 'bout the rims, but I ain't here for that\nGoing out like Big and Pac, I fear for that\nTake this Lambo, and put six holes in it\nShut up the glass and leave my body exposed in it\nLift the doors up and let all of my demons out\nAnd I can see my brother now cause that's what I've been dreamin 'bout\nI ain't thinkin 'bout bitches or pulling Beamers out\nI'm thinkin 'bout my sons' safety everytime they leave the house\nI know how to make it out the hood, I seen the route\nAnd here's the proof, me, Venus and Serena out\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: The Game]\nI'm sittin on these stairs at this church, 'bout to start a verse\nAnd somewhere in the world, somebody 'bout to start a hearse\nTell me who inside it, Who's son is that\nAnd how he get there, now tell me who gun was that\nI ain't saying confess, definitely ain't saying snitch\nBut if you killed the nigga, help his mama dig his ditch\nI'm from a hood where niggas gotta keep they gun cocked\nAnd kids wear Dre Beats to stop the sound of gun shots\nBut at least they got the Dre Beats\nCause kids in Africa ain't even got shoes on they feet\nAnd I seen it with my own eyes\nAt the same time I'm picking flies off my own eyes\nCan you feel that, If you can hear 'em buzzin\nYou can feel the pain of Mike Tyson and his baby mother\nThey lost they baby daughter, and she was only three\nShe never got a chance to blossom on the family tree\n\n[Hook]\n\nVerse 3: The Game]\n\nWe got a new president and I love that he black\nBut I'mma ask him like Bush \"Where the soldiers at?\"\nNow move the camera to New Orleans \"Where the soldiers at?\"\nThe water dried up, well nigga do the Nolia clap\nWe all juveniles, we all been through some trials\nAnd some tribulations, I'm in this booth pacin'\nWhat do I say next, should I talk about some cars?\nOr the next chapter of my life and show you all my scars\nAll my bullet wounds and my stab wounds\nI can't show you, I covered 'em up with tattoos\nI can't do nothing but spit the truth\nOn probation, smoke and drink Patron before I hit the booth\nYou makin' songs for the club, when niggas drinking\nI make 'em for the ride home, when niggas thinking\nOne minute you here, next minute shit is tragic\nAnd this a Jim Jonsin track, now feel the static\n\n[Hook]", "image":

Lord please send me an angel\nTo lead me out of this place\nTake me away, away\nFar away, to better days\n\n[Verse 1: The Game]\nFirst thing I wanna do is say \"What up\" to T.I\nKing of the south, now everybody see why\nI'm just driving and thinking how I survived here\nAnd I ain't seen Dre and Eminem in five years\nThat sound Shady right, I live a crazy life\nSo many black thoughts I had to paint the Mercedes white\nI could tell you 'bout the rims, but I ain't here for that\nGoing out like Big and Pac, I fear for that\nTake this Lambo, and put six holes in it\nShut up the glass and leave my body exposed in it\nLift the doors up and let all of my demons out\nAnd I can see my brother now cause that's what I've been dreamin 'bout\nI ain't thinkin 'bout bitches or pulling Beamers out\nI'm thinkin 'bout my sons' safety everytime they leave the house\nI know how to make it out the hood, I seen the route\nAnd here's the proof, me, Venus and Serena out\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: The Game]\nI'm sittin on these stairs at this church, 'bout to start a verse\nAnd somewhere in the world, somebody 'bout to start a hearse\nTell me who inside it, Who's son is that\nAnd how he get there, now tell me who gun was that\nI ain't saying confess, definitely ain't saying snitch\nBut if you killed the nigga, help his mama dig his ditch\nI'm from a hood where niggas gotta keep they gun cocked\nAnd kids wear Dre Beats to stop the sound of gun shots\nBut at least they got the Dre Beats\nCause kids in Africa ain't even got shoes on they feet\nAnd I seen it with my own eyes\nAt the same time I'm picking flies off my own eyes\nCan you feel that, If you can hear 'em buzzin\nYou can feel the pain of Mike Tyson and his baby mother\nThey lost they baby daughter, and she was only three\nShe never got a chance to blossom on the family tree\n\n[Hook]\n\nVerse 3: The Game]\n\nWe got a new president and I love that he black\nBut I'mma ask him like Bush \"Where the soldiers at?\"\nNow move the camera to New Orleans \"Where the soldiers at?\"\nThe water dried up, well nigga do the Nolia clap\nWe all juveniles, we all been through some trials\nAnd some tribulations, I'm in this booth pacin'\nWhat do I say next, should I talk about some cars?\nOr the next chapter of my life and show you all my scars\nAll my bullet wounds and my stab wounds\nI can't show you, I covered 'em up with tattoos\nI can't do nothing but spit the truth\nOn probation, smoke and drink Patron before I hit the booth\nYou makin' songs for the club, when niggas drinking\nI make 'em for the ride home, when niggas thinking\nOne minute you here, next minute shit is tragic\nAnd this a Jim Jonsin track, now feel the static\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "Fuck A Bitch", "album": "OKE: Operation Kill Everything ", "year": null,

these hoes with me but you can have em\nI don't cuff a bitch, pull up in some other shit\nNot that shit my other shit\nThis my bread and butter\nPeanut butter guts in the whip\nProject dirty got the pyrex burning\nTotin' iron moving birdies\nI'm a rich ass burglar\nDon't get yo bitch ass murdered\nI'm from Compton, hub city\nGot my thugs with me, got my bloods with me\nMaserati do a buck fitty\n\n[Bridge: Elijah Blake]\nI fear no nigga, I trust no bitch\nAnd these pretty bad broads be all on my dick\nGot this Amaretto make sure it don't drip\nSee I fear no nigga, I trust no bitch\nI don't trust no bitch, real niggas be like\n\n[Hook: Game]\nFuck a bitch(X6)\n\n[Verse 2: Nipsey Hu$$le]\nLook, fuck a bitch, never on no sucka shit\nAlways on some money motivated Nipsey Hu$$le shit\nPass on her, go fast on her\nPull out Benz coupes and count cash on her\nHoggy with me if i point he gon' blast on em\nDrop racks on a case, that's a gag order\nTough talk turn to sad stories\nFuck a bitch if he die that's too bad for it\nFuck a bitch I'm too fly, I'm a asshole\nI'm a bougie ass nigga with these fast hoes\nI got stripes and stamps on my passport\nYou got life fucked up so yo ass broke\nI be in some new shit\nHundred thousand plus coupe shit\nV.I.P Rose bull shit\nBitch 'fore you hit my bottle who is you with?\n\n[Bridge]\n\n[Hook: Game]\nFuck a bitch(X6)\n\n[Verse 3: Joe Moses]\nFuck a basketball wife and bet I didn't say nothin'\nPut a K up on a nigga, bet he won't bang nothin'\nBought a Roley for the homie, blood swear that he pimpin'\nRed bottoms cost a church shit I swear that I\u2019m Christian\nI\u2019m a all on a bitch- rain, hail, snow\nAnd if I ever love a bitch, I'm like hell no\nWell maybe at the Supperclub we was TU\nWe had to nickname this model bitch PU\nI'm the man in the city, AP's and gold bottles\n9 out of 10 she suck and she gon' swallow\n9 out of 10 she lookin' for ball players\nI\u2019m a pimp about mine, Giuseppe\u2019s don\u2019t do gators\nWeave to your knees believing you too on\nFuckin' for a sip in the club you too wrong\nGame called the nigga I'm like what's the deal\nHe like fuck a bitch nigga,

Siberia\nSame way they are in the middle of Nigeria\nEvery part of the whole world, there's an area\nThat, if you're poor, another day alive is a miracle\nThe blocks in Watts got crooked cops that frame the innocent\nNo different from Flint, Michigan\nLiving in the D, checking in with the pimps and them\nIt's similar to O-Town, in the Southern Peninsula\nPretty city, skyscrapers will fool you, look through to\nInner cities the rich won't move to\nThe nice parts, they well-protected by a vanguard\nThe opposite of how these concentration camps are\nLow-income housing, it dwells murderers\nBut children don\u2019t qualify for health services\nThe bourgeois act like they don\u2019t see starvations\nLike they spraying Est\u00e9e Lauder on sanitation\n\n[Chorus: will.i.am]\nIt seems like

It is produced by 1500 or Nothin' and DJ Quik, and features the Blink 182 drummer, Travis Barker. Beat sound a bit familiar? It\u2019s because the song samples a classic Beatles song \u2013 Eleanor Rigby AKA All The Lonely People.\nThe song, containg a fairly heavy drum beat, is mainly about the production and selling of Crack Cocaine. Some aspects are of Game\u2019s real life experience as a drug dealer in his youth, others are of exaggerated or typically \u2018West Coast gangster\u2019 situations. In true Jayceon Taylor style, there are mnay references and name drops, such as OJ Simpson, Ludacris, Dr. Dre, 50 Cent, hell\u2026 Even Game\u2019s grandmother!\nThe Dr. Dre mention touches on a continued theme in Game\u2019s music, since the whole of his previous album, Doctor\u2019s Advocate, was about Dre. There is a somewhat deep meaning continued as well, as Game feels the falling out with 50 Cent and subsequent leave from Dre\u2019s Aftermath label has caused his mentor and father figure to be disconnected from him.\nAs the beef was in it\u2019s prime during the time this song was released, it is unsurprising that Game takes a shot at 50, by making sexual regards to his girlfriend.\nThe single peaked at Number 11 on the U.S. Billboard Bubbling Under R&B/Hip-Hop Singles."}, "embed_content": "<div id='rg_embed_link_44989' class='rg_embed_link' data-song-id='44989'>Read <a

LAX\nReleased: June 24, 2008\nRecorded: 2008\nGenre: Rap Rock\nLabel: Geffen\n\nDope Boys is the second single from The Game\u2019s 3rd studio album, LAX. It is produced by 1500 or Nothin' and DJ Quik, and features the Blink 182 drummer, Travis Barker. Beat sound a bit familiar? It\u2019s because the song samples a classic Beatles song \u2013 Eleanor Rigby AKA All The Lonely People.\nThe song, containg a fairly heavy drum beat, is mainly about the production and selling of Crack Cocaine. Some aspects are of Game\u2019s real life experience as a drug dealer in his youth, others are of exaggerated or typically \u2018West Coast gangster\u2019 situations. In true Jayceon Taylor style, there are mnay references and name drops, such as OJ Simpson, Ludacris, Dr. Dre, 50 Cent, hell\u2026 Even Game\u2019s grandmother!\nThe Dr. Dre mention touches on a continued theme in Game\u2019s music, since the whole of his previous album, Doctor\u2019s Advocate, was about Dre. There is a somewhat deep meaning continued as well, as Game feels the falling out with 50 Cent and subsequent leave from Dre\u2019s Aftermath label has caused his mentor and father figure to be disconnected from him.\nAs the beef was in it\u2019s prime during the time this song was released, it is unsurprising that Game takes a shot at 50, by making sexual regards to his girlfriend.\nThe single peaked at Number 11 on the U.S. Billboard Bubbling Under R&B/Hip-Hop Singles."}, "comment_count": 0, "community": true, "custom_preview": null, "has_voters": true, "id": 3534887, "pinned":

want a piece I want my whole destiny\nIf you got it, I'm gone take it\nIf you're in it, you're coming with me\nBench warmers, get no playing time\nNo sleeping til I cross the line, I'm running\n\n[Verse 1: The Game]\nWith 99 miles left, on the Avis rental car\nBlowing horns like Miles Davis\nAt the pearly gate, God let me in\nGive me a room by Aaliyah with ESPN\nI know I got more sins than two lesbians\nBeen back and forth across the border like Mexicans\nBut I'm running like New York pedestrians\nTrying not to scuff my Nike Air checks again\nIt's funny how niggas be the best of friends\nAnd fall out over pussy and wanna dead they man\nOne of my niggas in the grave the other one in the pen\nShe fucking my enemies inside my homeboys Benz\nNow she begging God's mercy cause she ain't listen to Nas\nAnd never heard about Ike and the Iverson jersey\nHe got a cousin named Jayceon that rock the Gary Payton\nNow the same trifling bitch is a HIV patient, true story\n\n[Hook: Dion]\nGot to live for today cause tomorrow ain't promised to me\nDon't just want a piece I want my whole destiny\nIf you got it, I'm gone take it\nIf you're in it, you're coming with me\nBench warmers, get no playing time\nNo sleeping til I cross the line, I'm running\n\n[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]\nIf I get knocked with my gun nigga I'm running\nIf I catch a murder one nigga I'm running\nHomicide come around and they keep on coming\nThat's why I'm out of state and I keep on running\nI ain't Nelly but my Desert Eagle's on girl\nJust dropped bail traveling the world\nWhen I sign my deal I said fuck jail\nI went on tour to Barcelona and Brazil\nThis shit real fuck an appeal\nD's want my head like that bitch in Kill Bill\nSling dope sling crack and them E pills\nThat's why I'm on the low like a damn navy seal, I'm running\n\n[Hook: Dion]\nGot to live for today cause tomorrow ain't promised to me\nDon't just want a piece I want my whole destiny\nIf you got it, I'm gone take it\nIf you're in it, you're coming with me\nBench warmers, get no playing time\nNo sleeping til I cross the line, I'm running\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nCause I gotta pack them shows\nAnd Dre told me ain't no coming back from gold\nSo I gotta get my album in place\nMy G-Unit features, my Eminem sixteens, my Dr. Dre beats\nAnd it was two years from today when I started rhyming\nAnd took my demo to Suge and he ain't sign me\nNiggas threatening my life like it's hard to find me\nSee me shining in the hood like twenty inch Lexanis\nMy mom said I'm hard head, I don't follow the rules\nWhy should I when Reebok giving niggas they own shoes\nAnd I'm dealing with the same problems 50 Cent got\nYayo in jail and they think I'm trying to take his spot\nI'm in the studio laughing at Chris Rock\nThen I turn on MTV and see Soulja Slim shot\nAnd niggas trying to gun me down in the rim shop\nCause I just want the same recognition that the Crips got\nThey say I'm the next in line and if I get shot\nThen I go out as the Bobby Fischer of hip hop\nMake your chest move, Sylvia Rome and Kevin Lyle slept cool\nJimmy Iovine was the best move\n\n[Hook: Dion]\nGot to live for today cause tomorrow ain't promised to me\nDon't just want a piece I want my whole destiny\nIf you got it, I'm gone take it\nIf you're in it, you're coming with me\nBench warmers, get no playing time\nNo sleeping til I cross the line, I'm

D-R-E\nRun up I let it sing like Nate D-O-double-G\nWalk through 8 Mile, G-Unit's on my feet\nGot a cherry lowrider in the N-Y-C\nEve took me to Philly, never been to the pen\nBeen to Uptown with 50, seen niggas in Timbs\nI done seen Young Buck scuff Air Force Ones\nIn Cashville, but Compton is {where I'm from}\nWhere it's just me, my son, and my bitch\nShe graduated when Notorious BIG dropped \"Me & My Bitch\"\nShe get them birds past, I put her in first class\nAnd tell her to carry on that Dooney & Burke bag\nShe from Grape Street, she know how to work the mag\nAnd only buy white tees, tell 'em to keep the purple tags\nCause the laces in my Chucks keep the beef crackin\nI lay niggas out like creased khakis\nIn that G-wagon, lean like the 23's draggin\nI got the whole N-Y-C saggin\n\n[Hook: Nate Dogg]\nIf you don't know\n(Aftermath, nigga witta attitude) (Game time niggas, Westside)\nWhere I'm from\n(Nigga witta attitude) (Straight Outta Compton) (We rock khakis and Chucks)\nIf you don't know\n(Almost lost my life when Dre dropped The Chronic) (Legend in the making)\nWhere I'm from\n(Aftermath, you better watch your colors in the City of Angels)\n\n[Verse 2: Game]\nY'all niggas got it fucked up\nWhat you thought cause I'm from Compton I couldn't do numbers like Usher?\nPlatinum certified, nigga that's a mill' plus\nPlay both sides of the fence cause the Crips feel cuz\nSee me ridin with Nate, nigga it's still Blood\nYou can C-walk to this, homey it's still love\nNigga I've been bangin since Mary J did \"Real Love\"\n(If you don't know) I painted the Rover black\nThe West coast is back, I can smoke to that\nMoms got the CL-6, that's a fact\nI bought the house, I'm just waitin on the platinum plaques\nNiggas lookin for a cat to jack\nHomey I'm willin to do two life sentences back to back\nSo please don't push me\nYou niggas is W-N-B-A, all pussy\n\n[Hook - 2X]", "image":

D-O-double-G\nWalk through 8 Mile, G-Unit's on my feet\nGot a cherry lowrider in the N-Y-C\nEve took me to Philly, never been to the pen\nBeen to Uptown with 50, seen niggas in Timbs\nI done seen Young Buck scuff Air Force Ones\nIn Cashville, but Compton is {where I'm from}\nWhere it's just me, my son, and my bitch\nShe graduated when Notorious BIG dropped \"Me & My Bitch\"\nShe get them birds past, I put her in first class\nAnd tell her to carry on that Dooney & Burke bag\nShe from Grape Street, she know how to work the mag\nAnd only buy white tees, tell 'em to keep the purple tags\nCause the laces in my Chucks keep the beef crackin\nI lay niggas out like creased khakis\nIn that G-wagon, lean like the 23's draggin\nI got the whole N-Y-C saggin\n\n[Hook: Nate Dogg]\nIf you don't know\n(Aftermath, nigga witta attitude) (Game time niggas, Westside)\nWhere I'm from\n(Nigga witta attitude) (Straight Outta Compton) (We rock khakis and Chucks)\nIf you don't know\n(Almost lost my life when Dre dropped The Chronic) (Legend in the making)\nWhere I'm from\n(Aftermath, you better watch your colors in the City of Angels)\n\n[Verse 2: Game]\nY'all niggas got it fucked up\nWhat you thought cause I'm from Compton I couldn't do numbers like Usher?\nPlatinum certified, nigga that's a mill' plus\nPlay both sides of the fence cause the Crips feel cuz\nSee me ridin with Nate, nigga it's still Blood\nYou can C-walk to this, homey it's still love\nNigga I've been bangin since Mary J did \"Real Love\"\n(If you don't know) I painted the Rover black\nThe West coast is back, I can smoke to that\nMoms got the CL-6, that's a fact\nI bought the house, I'm just waitin on the platinum plaques\nNiggas lookin for a cat to jack\nHomey I'm willin to do two life sentences back to back\nSo please don't push me\nYou niggas is W-N-B-A, all pussy\n\n[Hook - 2X]"}}, {"title": "Letter to the King", "album": "LAX", "year": "2008-08-26", "lyrics": "[Produced by Hi-Tek]\n\n[Verse 1: The Game]\nSecond floor of my hotel, I'm rollin' up, 'bout to blaze\nAnd zone out, to this Frankie Beverly and Maze\nAs I daze about the past, and them days in the past\nHe set my mind free, so my mind free at last\nSo much that I don't even drink from a fuckin' glass\nI'd rather find the first fountain I can and do it fast\nDidn't understand the dream of a King, I do the math\nCoincidentally on your birthdays, I ditched the class\nCause the younger me, dumber me was chasin' the cash\nChasin' the ass, lowlife with his face in the grass\nRidin' home from school, in front of the bus\nNot even thinkin' 'bout how Rosa Parks done it for us\nHow she stayed behind bars and she done it for us\nAnd she stayed behind bars 'til she won it for us\nSometimes I wanna give up or at least take a break\nThat's when I close my eyes and see Coretta Scott's face\n(Ohhhh)\nCause sometimes I wanna give up or at least take a break\nThat's when I close my eyes and see Coretta Scott's face\n\n[Chorus: Sample]\nWay up high, saw it all\nA whole new world outside this bubble\nA whole new world outside this bubble\nWay up high, I will fly\nI will hover the world\nSaw it all\n\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nUhh, word up, Game\nStandin' at the pew, panaramic view of the seatin' and greetin'\nI've been meanin' to do me some letter readin'\nTo the King, he forever breathin', your message is never leavin'\nSome of your homies phonies, I should've said it when I see them\nThem sleazy bastards, some greedy pastors, jerks\nShould never be allowed at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta\nSo people be patient, I know this ghetto grammar\nBut I'm a street dude, normally I just speak rude\nMartin Luther, the martyr, the trooper, hate killed him\nNobel Peace Prize winner, they duplicate your feelin'\nAs a kid I ain't relate really\nI would say your dream speech jokingly, 'til your world awoke in me\nFirst I thought you were passive, soft one who ass kissed\nI was young but honest, I was feelin' Muhammad\nI ain't even know the strength you had to have to march\nYou was more than just talk, you the first real Braveheart\nWe miss you\nFeel like King be in me sometimes\n\n[Chorus: Sample]\nWay up high, saw it all\nA whole new world outside this bubble\nA whole new world outside this bubble\nWay up high, I will fly\nI will hover the world\nSaw it all\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nThe word \"nigga\" is nothin' like \"nigga\"\nDon't sound shit a like, like Game, like Jigga\nOne came before the other, like aim and pull the trigga\nOne is slang for my brother, one is hang and take a picture\nThe rope ain't tight enough, he still alive, go fix it\nPour some gasoline on him, call his daughters black bitches\nMake 'em pick cotton, while they mama cleanin' up the kitchen\nSame cotton in white T's, that's the cotton they was pickin'\nIf Dr. King marched today, would Bill Gates march?\nI know Obama would but would Hilary take part?\nGreat minds think great thoughts\nThe pictures I paint, make the Mona Lisa look like fake art\nI feel the pain of Nelson Mandela\nCause when it rains it pours, I need Rihanna's umbrella\nFor Coretta Scott's tear drops, when she got the phone call\nThat the future just took a fuckin' head shot\nI wonder why Jesse Jackson ain't catch him before his body dropped\nWould he give me the answer? Probably not\n\n[Chorus: Sample]\nWay up high, saw it all\nA whole new world outside this bubble\nA whole new world outside this bubble\nWay up high, I will fly\nI will hover the world\nSaw it all\nI will hover the world\nSaw it all", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bba1920bee43a618432ce43748293ec6.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "The Game", "raw": {"annotation_count": 8, "api_path": "/songs/4995", "apple_music_id": "288649654", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/4995/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "A tribute to Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King Jr. and his wife Coretta Scott King.

to blaze\nAnd zone out, to this Frankie Beverly and Maze\nAs I daze about the past, and them days in the past\nHe set my mind free, so my mind free at last\nSo much that I don't even drink from a fuckin' glass\nI'd rather find the first fountain I can and do it fast\nDidn't understand the dream of a King, I do the math\nCoincidentally on your birthdays, I ditched the class\nCause the younger me, dumber me was chasin' the cash\nChasin' the ass, lowlife with his face in the grass\nRidin' home from school, in front of the bus\nNot even thinkin' 'bout how Rosa Parks done it for us\nHow she stayed behind bars and she done it for us\nAnd she stayed behind bars 'til she won it for us\nSometimes I wanna give up or at least take a break\nThat's when I close my eyes and see Coretta Scott's face\n(Ohhhh)\nCause sometimes I wanna give up or at least take a break\nThat's when I close my eyes and see Coretta Scott's face\n\n[Chorus: Sample]\nWay up high, saw it all\nA whole new world outside this bubble\nA whole new world outside this bubble\nWay up high, I will fly\nI will hover the world\nSaw it all\n\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nUhh, word up, Game\nStandin' at the pew, panaramic view of the seatin' and greetin'\nI've been meanin' to do me some letter readin'\nTo the King, he forever breathin', your message is never leavin'\nSome of your homies phonies, I should've said it when I see them\nThem sleazy bastards, some greedy pastors, jerks\nShould never be allowed at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta\nSo people be patient, I know this ghetto grammar\nBut I'm a street dude, normally I just speak rude\nMartin Luther, the martyr, the trooper, hate killed him\nNobel Peace Prize winner, they duplicate your feelin'\nAs a kid I ain't relate really\nI would say your dream speech jokingly, 'til your world awoke in me\nFirst I thought you were passive, soft one who ass kissed\nI was young but honest, I was feelin' Muhammad\nI ain't even know the strength you had to have to march\nYou was more than just talk, you the first real Braveheart\nWe miss you\nFeel like King be in me sometimes\n\n[Chorus: Sample]\nWay up high, saw it all\nA whole new world outside this bubble\nA whole new world outside this bubble\nWay up high, I will fly\nI will hover the world\nSaw it all\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nThe word \"nigga\" is nothin' like \"nigga\"\nDon't sound shit a like, like Game, like Jigga\nOne came before the other, like aim and pull the trigga\nOne is slang for my brother, one is hang and take a picture\nThe rope ain't tight enough, he still alive, go fix it\nPour some gasoline on him, call his daughters black bitches\nMake 'em pick cotton, while they mama cleanin' up the kitchen\nSame cotton in white T's, that's the cotton they was pickin'\nIf Dr. King marched today, would Bill Gates march?\nI know Obama would but would Hilary take part?\nGreat minds think great thoughts\nThe pictures I paint, make the Mona Lisa look like fake art\nI feel the pain of Nelson Mandela\nCause when it rains it pours, I need Rihanna's umbrella\nFor Coretta Scott's tear drops, when she got the phone call\nThat the future just took a fuckin' head shot\nI wonder why Jesse Jackson ain't catch him before his body dropped\nWould he give me the answer? Probably not\n\n[Chorus: Sample]\nWay up high, saw it all\nA whole new world outside this bubble\nA whole new world outside this bubble\nWay up high, I will fly\nI will hover the world\nSaw it all\nI will hover the world\nSaw it all"}}, {"title": "LA", "album": "The Documentary 2", "year": "2015-10-09", "lyrics": "[Produced by will.i.am]\n\n[Hook: will.i.am]\nI'm cooling in LA\nThe place where stars are born\nAnd it ain't never cold outside\nBecause the rain will never storm\nAnd the stars ain't only in the sky\nBecause the stars lay on the floor\nAnd I-I-I-I-I, I got the city on lock if you wanna explore\nAnd baby I been cooling in LA\n\n[Verse 1: The Game]\nPull up to the Rosco's\nOnly guy here, cause niggas from here\nKnow you gotta swerve around the potholes\nEating chickens with these chickens, politicin'\nWe gon' get a new team or not?\nThey up and down like Impala switches\nAll these girls got extensions, even with the long hair\nEverybody tripping, we mix C\u00eeroc with Patr\u00f3n here\nDon't walk around alone here, everybody from a gang\nNiggas ask you where you from\nThat mean you gotta run that chain\nSmoking on that purple rain\nWe only smoke a certain strain\nSoon as you call twice nigga\nWelcome to the circle maine\nCatch me off of Rodeo, Alameda, Figueroa\nWhoop these rappers ass, they all bums nigga, skid row\nAnd I ain't dissing homeless people, I be down there feeding niggas\n100 days, 100 nights, we killing for no reason nigga\nLa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, look at me in my Impala\n\n[Hook: will.i.am & Fergie]\nIn LA\nThe place where stars are born\nAnd it ain't never cold outside\nBecause the rain will never storm\nAnd the stars ain't only in the sky\nBecause the stars lay on the floor\nAnd I-I-I-I-I, I got the city on lock if you wanna explore\nAnd baby I been cooling in LA\nLa-la-la-la-la-la\nBaby when you coming to LA?\nLa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la\n\n[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg & The Game]\nI'm from that big blue raggin', tip toe taggin'\nMustard and mayonnaise, with Daynas on the wagon\nBrown paper baggin', baby mama naggin'\nYou're either skinny jeans, Gucci belt or straight saggin'\nPleasure and agony, black James Cagney\nThe wood is the wood, but the hood is like a cavity\nSo much tragedy, rarely see clarity\nI'm like a heir-to-be, charity, sincerely\nLos Angeles, scandalous, handle us how?\nWe the ones you get your swag from, write that down\nHome of the green leaf, watch out now\nHigh school lesson, y'all can drop out now\nCalifornia highway, California my way\nI do it that way, then roll a fat jay\nLa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, look at me in my Cadillac car\n\n[Hook: will.i.am & Fergie]\nIn LA\nThe place where stars are born\nAnd it ain't never cold outside\nBecause the rain will never storm\nAnd the stars ain't only in the sky\nBecause the stars lay on the floor\nAnd I-I-I-I-I, I got the city on lock if you wanna explore\nAnd baby I been cooling in LA\nLa-la-la-la-la-la\nBaby when you coming to LA?\nLa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la\n\n[Verse 3: will.i.am]\nI got LA poppin', cars be hoppin'\nNo refreshing these hoes, they keep shoppin'\nSunset droppin', chicken heads flockin'\nNo recess, my flows, there's no stoppin'\nDeLorean rollin', pockets stay swollen\nDrive down the 10, East Los is where I'm goin'\nCholo swagger, que pasa wassup?\nI'm rockin it in LA\nLA native, LA Raider, LA Rams, motherfuckin' traitors\nLA Clippers, LA Lakers, trippin' off Kobe, you the motherfuckin' greatest\nLA Dodgers, finger to the Padres\nEast Los niggas sayin' chinga tu madre\nLa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, look at me in my fancy car\n\n[Hook 2: will.i.am & Fergie]\nIn LA\nThe place where stars are born\nAnd it ain't never cold outside\nBecause the rain will never storm\nAnd the stars ain't only in the sky\nBecause the stars lay on the floor\nAnd I-I-I-I-I, I got the city on lock if you wanna explore\nAnd baby I been coolin' in-\n(Compton, Compton, Compton, Compton, Compton, Compton)\n\n[Verse 4: The Game]\nIt's time to blackout, time to spit this crack out\nNiggas been fiending for this shit, Aftermath a crackhouse\nThe way I spit, niggas'll think I pulled the Mac out\nI said the way I spit, niggas'll think I blew J-Lo back out\nStill Compton nigga, fuck y'all thought I went on vacation?\nSame nigga that used to break in houses and steal PlayStation's\nI hate waitin'\nI told Dre to put out Detox, or I'mma do it\nThis is that nigga, The Chronic mixed with embalming fluid\nBring your chin here blood, so I can put this llama to it\nDisrespectful nigga, see this window?

cause niggas from here\nKnow you gotta swerve around the potholes\nEating chickens with these chickens, politicin'\nWe gon' get a new team or not?\nThey up and down like Impala switches\nAll these girls got extensions, even with the long hair\nEverybody tripping, we mix C\u00eeroc with Patr\u00f3n here\nDon't walk around alone here, everybody from a gang\nNiggas ask you where you from\nThat mean you gotta run that chain\nSmoking on that purple rain\nWe only smoke a certain strain\nSoon as you call twice nigga\nWelcome to the circle maine\nCatch me off of Rodeo, Alameda, Figueroa\nWhoop these rappers ass, they all bums nigga, skid row\nAnd I ain't dissing homeless people, I be down there feeding niggas\n100 days, 100 nights, we killing for no reason nigga\nLa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la,

Game\u2019s 2005 debut album The Documentary which detailed the birth of his first son, Harlem Caron Taylor on June 30, 2003. The track also highlights Game\u2019s blessing that Harlem does not have to grow up to be a gangster like his dad.\n\nFor the sequel track, Game has once again teamed up with Busta Rhymes who featured on the original \u201cLike Father, Like Son\u201d track and also on other tracks \u2013 most notably on \u201cDoctor\u2019s Advocate\u201d from his second album Doctor\u2019s Advocate.\n\n\n\nIn this song Harlem is old enough to actually sing his own hook with very slight help from his \u201cuncle\u201d Busta Rhymes."}, "comment_count": 0, "community": true, "custom_preview": null, "has_voters":

Like father, like son\nHad a million dollars 'fore I was 1\nCause my daddy hustle\nWe good now\nCause my daddy hustle\nWe out the hood now\nCause my daddy hustle\n\n[Verse 1: Harlem Taylor]\nWinning like Steph Curry in the chip though\nUsed to be the only one, now I'm the big bro (I'm big too)\nKnow my daddy schizo, don't mess with his kids yo\nMe and my brother tight (yeah), we like the Klitschkos\nI love you daddy\n\n[Verse 2: The Game]\nTen years later, I love you too sons\nI do life in the box if they ever fuck with my two sons\nYou're my lil' man, I remember the first day you came out\nYour lil' face, your big nose, your lil' feet, your lil' hands\nYou turned one, come in the room wobbly, lil' stance\nAnd every time I walked in the house he used to do this lil' dance\nOn the cover of the album with them Chucks on\nYou cried for 6 hours, your mama in here going nuts on me\nShe said you had enough, I said we having fun\nAll babies cry when they're one, my career had just begun\nAnd so did being a daddy\nCar seat in my Escalade, you want me in the Caddy\nPlaying Like Father, Like Son, looking in the back seat\nHe don't look nothing like his mama if you ask me\nOn the first album Busta Rhymes did the hook\nNow he can do it for himself, watch him and his uncle cook\nBuss\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes]\nI'm glad you grew up to becoming everything you could be\nThat's all I wanted for you young'n, like father, like son\nAnd in the end I'm glad you only turned out better than me\nI hope you know I love you young'n, like father, like son\nYour daddy told you it was coming\nComing, your day was coming, I told you\nNow daddy's here just keep on running\nRunning, just keep on running, I tell you\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nI wanna thank my baby mamas Tiff and Eliska for everything\nY'all deserve the world, I wasn't worthy of no wedding ring\nIt ain't be one day since I met you I wasn't there for you\nWasn't husband material, but you know I really cared for you\nAnd I know you remember that time when he was 5\nAll these tours taking the toll, I can see it in his eyes\nSo I stopped tours, stopped rapping, didn't give a fuck about\nNothing that happened after recording The Doctor's Advocate\nCatching up with my son, cause ain't nothing more important\nThan walking inside the Footlocker, copping them matching Jordans\nHelping him with his jumper, the day he turned 9\nI asked him what he want for his birthday, he said to spend some time\nSo we kick it, that's my best friend, I don't have to get married\nHe still my best man, and that's forever\nAnybody can be a daddy, just bust a nut and leave\nBut I'm a father, and I'ma be everything he need and more\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes]\nI'm glad you grew up to becoming everything you could be\nThat's all I wanted for you young'n, like father, like son\nAnd in the end I'm glad you only turned out better than me\nI hope you know I love you young'n, like father, like son\nYour daddy told you it was coming\nComing, your day was coming, I told you\nNow daddy's here just keep on running\nRunning, just keep on running, I tell you\n\n[Verse 4: The Game]\nEvery time I get in this booth\nI'm reminded ten years ago I did it for you\nHad this vision for you, and I know your daddy get in trouble sometimes\nBut I'ma stay up out this prison for you, I mean\nYou all my seed, lil' brother and both of your sisters\nYou all I need like Method and MJB\nAnd I know I be wildin' sometimes, you told me (\"Breathe daddy\") (1,1, 2,2, 3,3, 4,4)\nFurthermore, I'm try'na stay outta trouble just for my sons\nEven though it feel weird leaving my house without a gun\nI just gotta do it, cause they might grow up and do this shit\nJust cause they father do it, fuck with my kids and six Bloods\nJumping out a Buick, understand Puff choking that man for Jus\nI'ma do my stuff even if I land in fucking cuffs\nFor every nigga out here without a kid\nHave one and that's gon be the best shit you ever did\nOne\n\n[Outro: Harlem Taylor (King Justice)]\nI'm Harlem, The Game's oldest son\nI make straight A's and I'm a good kid\nBut more importantly, I'm safe\nBecause my daddy hustled his way out of Compton\nSo I could have a better life\nThat's my daddy\nAnd I wish all kids had one like mine\nThe world would be a better place\nOne\n(Wait Harlem, I wanna say something)"}}, {"title":

played out on that movie screen\nHad to scope with some killers, almost died from moving green\nMy mama a felon, my daddy so long gone\nMy grandmama died at 18, left me all alone\nAll I got is my guns, bandanas, some weed\nLeave me with 2 dead brothers, my enemies gon' bleed\nI'm masked up, suicidal, rest in peace to Hayes\nWasn't no killers, swear my niggas seen some better days\nWhen California have you stressed out, a million ways to die\nGotta pull that vest out, cause\n\n[Hook]\nWhen the gang signs go up\nYou see your life flash right before your eyes\nAnd you know what\nThat's

cry\nWhite chalk, black streets\nRed rack, coke killer, watch 'em leak\nBlack on black crimes, killing our own brothers\nBut what the fuck can you do when you got on the wrong colors?\nTake a breath, inhale, let it go, lights off\nHave a problem, hit the switch, lay it low\nSoon as you walk out the crib, we gon' blast\nHit the 110 and now the one time on your ass\nIn 4 minutes, you thought that you got away with it\nThought that shit was a dream, let us pray cause\n\n[Hook]\nWhen the gang signs go up\nYou see your life flash right before your eyes\nAnd you know what\nThat's how it is on the

hello\nPut your hands in the sky, that's where we gon go\nI like you so I gotta put a ring on that\nYou the one that I wanna put everything on that\nLet's go, baby this is hello\n\n[Verse 1 : Game]\nShe used to wake up to The View\nNow she wake up with a view\nUsed to wake up to a kiss\nNow she wake up to a shoe\nUsed to dream about millions\nNow she workin with a few\nUsed to know one Porsche, now she know two\nChanel handbags stuck to her like glue\nMinks and chinchillas, whole closet like a zoo\nAgent Provocateur, Louis and lots of Dior\nAll her friends wearing Gucci so she don't rock it no more\nEverytime we in Jimmy Choo, they gotta lock up the store\nWalk out with boxes galore\nNext week she cop her some more\nAlexander McQueen cause she my queen\nSpent an Aston Martin on the ring..\n\n[Hook : Lloyd]\n\n[Verse 2 : Game]\nSoon as them butterfly doors go up on the Ferrari\nShe step outside the car on there, stumble into Bulgari\nFall in that YSL, try it on, you fly as hell\nDon't really like it, but I'm buying it: might as well\nHave her own reality show: no drama\nGrab your girl, we're shooting real housewives in the Bahamas\n2-piece Hermes, Bottega Veneta flats\nHeard Diddy out here so you know where the party at\nWe on.. and I ain't even gotta ask twice\nCause when we hit the room she up and down like the gas price - damn!\nGot chills thinking of last night\nI swear you was a goddess in your past life\n\n[Hook : Lloyd]\n\n[Verse 3 : Lloyd]\nGirl I know you wanna get away\nThis hotel room, that's where it goes down\nAnd I know we never get away\nJust give me a couple minutes and I'm in it\nWe all over the table, ain't no problem with you sweating on me\nAnd I ain't pulling out, I'm tryna have fun\nI know you tryna have fun..\nYou ain't gotta say bye bye, baby this is hello\nAnd you ain't gotta front for your friends, you know I had you at hello\nAnd Louboutins that I got you on your birthday, that was hello\nAnd all them bottles that we popped on the first date, that was hello"}}], "artist": "The Game"}
