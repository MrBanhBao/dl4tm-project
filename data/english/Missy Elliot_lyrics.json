dance that you doing is dumb\nHow they do it where you from?\nStickin' out your tongue\nGirl, but you know you're too young\nA bunch of girls do it and the shit look fun\nThat's how they do it where we from\nYou know it don't start till one\nThat's how they do it where they from\n\n[Verse 1: Missy Elliott]\nI'm so faded, no exaggeration\nBacks breakin' like a percolation\nBoys to the yard for some hip spankin'\nWhere you make it drop down like you in the matrix\nCan't take it, them chicks been fakin'\nY'all still sleep, better stay awakened\nHot new dance for the hood to make it\nMake the donk move fast, make them think you drinkin'\nHead to the floor don't collect that though\nYou better huddle up cause the beat's so cold\nPop that, pop that, cock and reload\nThis another hit, I got an ace in the hole\nBoys on my back, playa did you peep that?\nYou got a small stack, playa, you can keep that\nI'm a Big Mac make you wanna eat that\nLike m-m-m-m-m, yak it to the yak\nJunk in the trunk make you pumps in the bump\nGirls wanna have fun make you stickin' out your tongue\n\n[Hook: Missy Elliott]\nShorty what?\nThe dance that you doing is dumb\nHow they do it where you from?\nStickin' out your tongue girl\nBut you know you're too young\nA bunch of girls do it and the shit look fun\nThat's how they do it where we from\nYou know it don't start till one\nThat's how they do it where they from\n\n[Verse 2: Pharrell]\nI come into this bitch like liquid\nDrip, drip, then the business\nClick, click, get your picture\nHerm\u00e9s Trismegistus\nWitness and get lifted\nBasic, nigga I was born in the basement\nShape shift, nigga I think like a spaceship\nFalse, oh-nah-nah-nah\nI am so different than y'all, so far apart\nThe way that I balance the bars\nI never fall, and if I do I just call\nThe almighty yellow star, God\nLyrically I'm Optimus Prime\nThe car I drive, look far I ride\nWhen I go by, smoke in your eyes\nSo open your eyes, the joke's on you guys\nAnd you ain't gotta be a mason to see through\nSome of this shit on occasion\n\n[Hook: Missy Elliott]\nShorty what?\nThe dance that you doing is dumb\nHow they do it where you from?\nStickin' out your tongue girl\nBut you know you're too young\nA bunch of girls do it and the shit look fun\nThat's how they do it where we from\nYou know it don't start till one\nThat's how they do it where they from\n\n[Verse 3: Missy Elliott]\nI'm like kak-a-rak-a-rak-rak-a-rak-a-rak\nMake a new track, make 'em fall on they crack\nGive 'em a slap, appetizer and smack\nI'm so fat in the back, make the boys all collapse\nYeah when I rap they be all on my jack\nBoys wanna jump on this pussy cat\nGot a new idea, let me switch it\nMan, I'm so futuristic\nBig lips and big, big, big hips\nBody be thick like a biscuit\nDifferent, rippin' shit, microphone grippin' it\nGettin' these Benjamins, new car, whippin' it\nUh, I'm so far ahead of ya'll, man I'm on top of the stars\nI don't care none of you are, blah-blah-blah-blah\nYou best to go rewrite your bars\n\n[Outro Missy Elliott & (Pharrell)]\nShawty what?\nHow they do it where you from? (Triflin'!)\nHow they do it where you from?\nThat's how they do it where we from\nThat's how they do it where they from\nShawty what?\nHow they do it where you from?

Timbaland produced and co-wrote the song and appeared in the video (the beginning of Elliott\u2019s longtime collaboration with director Hype Williams until he was replaced by Dave Meyers). Elliott played up her size in the video by wearing an enormous inflated trash bag \u2013 a \u201cscrew you\u201d to all the execs who told her she was too fat to make it in the music

ooh, ooh, ah, ah, ooh, ooh, ah\n\n[Verse 1]\nBoy I'mma make you love me, make you want me\nAnd I'mma give you some attention, tonight (Shut up!)\nNow follow my intuitions, what you're wishin'\nSee I'mma keep you up all night (all night), for a long time\nSo start countin' away\n\n[Hook]\nBreak me off, show me what you got\nCause I don't want, no one minute man\nBreak me off, show me what you got\nCause I don't want, no one minute man\nBreak me off, show me what you got\nCause I don't want, no one minute man\nBreak me off, show me what you got\nCause I don't want, no\n\n[Verse 2]\nTonight I'mma give it to you, throw it to you\nI want you to come prepared, ohh yeah (Oh yes)\nBoy it's been a long time, a crazy long time\nAnd I don't want no minute man, and that's real\nGive it to me some more\n\n[Hook]\nBreak me off, show me what you got\nCause I don't want, no one minute man\nBreak me off, show me what you got\nCause I don't want, no one minute man\nBreak me off, show me what you got\nCause I don't want, no one minute man\nBreak me off, show me what you got\nCause I don't want, no\n\n[Verse 3: Ludacris]\nIt's time to set your clock back bout as long as you can\nI stop daylight, it's Ludacris the maintenance man\nGet your oil changed, I check fluids and transmission\nYou one minute fools, you wonder why y'all missin\nOn the back of milk cartons and there's no reward\nNo regards, close but it's no cigar\nA hard head make a soft ass, but a hard dick make the sex last\nI jump in pools and make a big splash\nWater overflowin, so get your head right\nIt's all in your mind punk so keep your head tight\nEnough with tips and advice and thangs\nI'm big dog, havin women seein stripes and thangs\nThey go to sleep, start snorin, countin sheep and shit\nThey so wet, that they body start to leak and shit\nJust cause I'm an all-nighter, shoot all fire\nLudacris, balance and rotate all tires\n\n[Bridge]\nOoh, I don't want I don't need I can't stand no minute man\nI don't want no minute man\nOoh, here's your chance be a man take my hand understand\nI don't want no minute man\n\n[Hook]\nBreak me off, show me what you got\nCause I don't want, no one minute man\nBreak me off, show me what you got\nCause I don't want, no one minute man\nBreak me off, show me what you got\nCause I don't want, no one minute man\nBreak me off, break me off, break me off\nCause I don't want, no one minute man\n\n[Verse 4: Trina]\nYou know lil' mama ain't with that quick shit\nYou better break me off stiff tongue or stiff dick\nOne minute, two minutes, three minutes\nHell naw, to please me you gotta sleep in it\nI see you talk a good game and you play hard\nBut if I put this thing on ya, can you stay hard?\nIf not, you better keep your day job\nCause I'm looking for a man to make me say God\nI'm off glass and you know this\nI'll work your ass out like aerobics\nSo baby stay focused\nStart off slow and then speed it up\nBaby show me what you got, is you a G or what?\nIf you can't beat it up then eat it up\nPut a cherry on top, whip cream it up, What?\n\n[Outro]\nBreak me off, show me what you got\nCause I don't want, no one minute man\nBreak me off, show me what you got"}}, {"title": "Pass That Dutch", "album": "This is Not a Test!", "year": "2003-10-14", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nListen up, everyone!\nWe have been just informed that there's an

Elliott]\nSlim Shady (x3)\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nWell I do pop pills\nI keep my tube socks filled\nAnd pop the same shit that got 2Pac killed\nSpit game to these hoes\nLike a soap opera episode\nAnd punch a bitch in the nose til her whole face explodes\nThere's three things I hate\nGirls, women, and bitches\nI'm that vicious to walk up and drop-kick midgets\nThey call me Boogie Night\nThe stalker that walks awkward\nStick figure with a dick bigger than Mark Wahlberg\nComing through the airport\nSluggish, walking on crutches\nHit a fucking [pregnant] bitch in her [stomach] with luggage\nIt's like a dream I can't snap out\nI black out, I'm back out\nI'm lookin for something of to beat the crap out\nI'm bringing you rap singers two middle fingers\nI flip you off in French\nThen translate in English\nThen I'mma vanish off the face of the planet and come back\nSpeaking so much Spanish, Pun can't even understand it\n\n[Hook: Missy Elliott]\nWon't you busa rhyme for me, boy (Slim Shady)\nWon't you busa rhyme for me boy, Slim motherfucking Shady\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nI had a huge attitude, started off staticky\nMad at you, had you mad at me automatically\nI'm not a commodity, I'm an oddity\nWho oddly enough developed himself a Halloween following\nIt's so big if I counted up all the freaks who follow me\nI'd probably owe Ozzy Osbourne an apology\nCollege girls, live in an alcoholic's world\nFull of url, head twirls every time the toilet swirls\nCovered in throw-up, and I refuse to grow up\nI won't budge, I still tell a grown-up to shut up\nI made this rap game suspenseful, cause now I got an impulse\nGave to insult you with a pencil (Bitch)\nAnd waste the paper on you\nChopping down the oakwood\nCause everything that you wrote in your notebook was no good\nAnd as long as I stay in the studio and keep cuttin'\nYou motherfuckers are puttin' your words together for nothin'\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Bridge: Missy Elliott]\nTurn the music up, we gonna wake the neighbors\nWe gon' get high, we gon' roll the Vega's\nMe and Slim Shady on some shit daily\nWhat you want, what you got\nIs it hot, is it hot\nTurn the music up, we gonna wake the neighbors\nWe gonna get high, we gonna roll to Vegas\nMe and Slim Shady, on some shit daily\nWhat you want, what you want\n\"A person from another planet might disagree with you.\"\n\"Well if you want my opinion, he comes from right here on Earth.\"\n\n[Interlude]\nSlim Shady, Misdemeanor\nTimbaland\nSlim Shady, Misdemeanor\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nI'm homicidal and suicidal with no friends\nHolding a gun with no handle, just a barrel at both ends\nSpraying tecs at you until you see your fucking legs\nWith the bullet holes and the exit wounds laying next to you\nFucking mad dog, foaming at the mouth\nFuck mouth, my whole house is foaming at the couch\nJumped out of the 93rd floor of a building\nAnd shot every window out on the way down to the ground\n(Keep filming)\nWoke up to a hospital staff, got up and laughed, chopped 'em in half\nSuffocated the oxygen mask\nShit, if I get any higher\nImma get the East and West beefing again\nSlide back to Detroit and stand in the crossfire\n\n[Verse 4: Missy Elliott]\nY'all better call the police 'fore I kill this track\nDon't shoot Missy, get back\nI'mma put you all in the line and I'mma watch you MC's die\nYo Mommy, Mommy, Missy done lost her mind\nI think somebody done pissed her off this time\nI'mma have to bust you through your chest and\nYou gonna have to clean up the mess\nIt's raining, raining and it's pouring loud\nNever fear, cause pissy Missy's through the crowd\nI hear the gats go cha-pow\nWho shot me dammit, bitch get down\nDon't walk when I talk, I never talk when I smile\nLay em on down, like they lived underground\nFor the sound that me and Timbaland, we found\nGet your ass kicked later or get your ass kicked now\n\n[Outro]\nUhh, one-two Misdemeanor, Slim Shady, Timbaland, motherfucker\nUhh uhh uhh, two, two, two, triple

2Pac killed\nSpit game to these hoes\nLike a soap opera episode\nAnd punch a bitch in the nose til her whole face explodes\nThere's three things I hate\nGirls, women, and bitches\nI'm that vicious to walk up and drop-kick midgets\nThey call me Boogie Night\nThe stalker that walks awkward\nStick figure with a dick bigger than Mark Wahlberg\nComing through the airport\nSluggish, walking on crutches\nHit a fucking [pregnant] bitch in her [stomach] with luggage\nIt's like a dream I can't snap out\nI black out, I'm back out\nI'm lookin for something of to beat the crap out\nI'm bringing you rap singers two middle fingers\nI flip you off in French\nThen translate in English\nThen I'mma vanish off the face of the planet and come back\nSpeaking so much Spanish, Pun can't even understand it\n\n[Hook: Missy Elliott]\nWon't you busa rhyme for me, boy (Slim Shady)\nWon't you busa rhyme for me boy, Slim motherfucking Shady\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nI had a huge attitude, started off staticky\nMad at you, had you mad at me automatically\nI'm not a commodity, I'm an oddity\nWho oddly enough developed himself a Halloween following\nIt's so big if I counted up all the freaks who follow me\nI'd probably owe Ozzy Osbourne an apology\nCollege girls, live in an alcoholic's world\nFull of url, head twirls every time the toilet swirls\nCovered in throw-up, and I refuse to grow up\nI won't budge, I still tell a grown-up to shut up\nI made this rap game suspenseful, cause now I got an impulse\nGave to insult you with a pencil (Bitch)\nAnd waste the paper on you\nChopping down the oakwood\nCause everything that you wrote in your notebook was no good\nAnd as long as I stay in the studio and keep cuttin'\nYou motherfuckers are puttin' your words together for nothin'\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Bridge: Missy Elliott]\nTurn the music up, we gonna wake the neighbors\nWe gon' get high, we gon' roll the Vega's\nMe and Slim Shady on some shit daily\nWhat you want, what you got\nIs it hot, is it hot\nTurn the music up, we gonna wake the neighbors\nWe gonna get high, we gonna roll to Vegas\nMe and Slim Shady, on some shit daily\nWhat you want, what you want\n\"A person from another planet might disagree with you.\"\n\"Well if you want my opinion, he comes from right here on Earth.\"\n\n[Interlude]\nSlim Shady, Misdemeanor\nTimbaland\nSlim Shady, Misdemeanor\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nI'm homicidal and suicidal with no friends\nHolding a gun with no handle, just a barrel at both ends\nSpraying tecs at you until you see your fucking legs\nWith the bullet holes and the exit wounds laying next to you\nFucking mad dog, foaming at the mouth\nFuck mouth, my whole house is foaming at the couch\nJumped out of the 93rd floor of a building\nAnd shot every window out on the way down to the ground\n(Keep filming)\nWoke up to a hospital staff, got up and laughed, chopped 'em in half\nSuffocated the oxygen mask\nShit, if I get any higher\nImma get the East and West beefing again\nSlide back to Detroit and stand in the crossfire\n\n[Verse 4: Missy Elliott]\nY'all better call the police 'fore I kill this track\nDon't shoot Missy, get back\nI'mma put you all in the line and I'mma watch you MC's die\nYo Mommy, Mommy, Missy done lost her mind\nI think somebody done pissed her off this time\nI'mma have to bust you through your chest and\nYou gonna have to clean up the mess\nIt's raining, raining and it's pouring loud\nNever fear, cause pissy Missy's through the crowd\nI hear the gats go cha-pow\nWho shot me dammit, bitch get down\nDon't walk when I talk, I never talk when I smile\nLay em on down, like they lived underground\nFor the sound that me and Timbaland, we found\nGet your ass kicked later or get your ass kicked now\n\n[Outro]\nUhh, one-two Misdemeanor, Slim Shady, Timbaland, motherfucker\nUhh uhh uhh, two, two, two, triple zero"}}, {"title": "Hot Boyz (Remix)", "album": null, "year": "1999-11-09", "lyrics":

profits\nFor what I'm selling, never gon' stop it\nSocking it to niggas and rocking it\nDropping 'em on the spot\nHeat up any block or record shop\nKnocking you off of your socks\nGuaranteed platinum, watch two of the coldest bitches get hot\nI be the B-R-A-T, her be Missy\nWe some bad bitches who be fucking it up\nI'm the B-R-A-T, her be Missy\nAnd we some bad bitches who be fucking it

'em goddammit\nIt's 9-7, this the motherfuckin' bitch era\nWhat y'all niggas wanna do?\nThe Brat-tat-tat on that ass once more\nI'm out the door motherfucker, yeah, uh"}}, {"title": "She's a Bitch",

outside in the summertime\nI just might change the weather\nI'm done with the Benz so I bought a Wraith\nI don't trust the bank so I bought a safe\nThis fur on me like I fought a ape\nI'm killin' 'em,

pilots, damn and I'm shinin'\nAll my bitches with me, 305's finest\nDon't come around us if you ain't 'bout commas\nCommas, commas, commas, commas\nShow you how to hit a lick\nCollect the profit, watch it flip\n(He watchin' my body like he watchin' Scandal\nBut I'm just yeah) Never front, so you spend\n\n[Chorus: Cainon Lamb]\nI'ma start it from the bottom\nShow you how to flip a dollar\nI got

this money for days\nLife is so good, it feel good\nNo worries with all of these foreigns up in my driveway\nI ain't got no time for no dumb shit\nA lot of y'all be on some bum shit\nFirst I got my D's up, then I got my pounds up\nWhat you been talkin' ain't addin' up\nMarch to the beat of my own drum\nPhilly to London conundrum\nI've been this way, baby since the first day\nBut they keep askin', \"Where the fuck does she come from?\"\nI'm better\n\n[Chorus: Cainon Lamb]\nI'ma start it from the bottom\nShow you how to flip a dollar\nI got food in my dinin' room\nI'm better, I'm better,

you see how them bitches move they booty\nEvery time you play this record smell they coochie, follow them\nScreamin' like a groupie\nMisdemeanor move my nookie like a coochie\nFuck them haters, haters fuck whatever you say\nBecause you know I'm too cool for you anyway\nI'm just a bad bitch\nM-I-S miss\nI'm gone keep talking shit till you get this\nI'm gone bust up in the club with no guest list\nThe other artists I'll keep em' all restless\nI don't french kiss, unless it's 50 Cent\nVivica we can share him like the president\nTabloids I don't care it's irrelevant\nI'm heaven sent now watch how I do this shit\n\n[Hook]\nHo!.....Ho (I'm..I'm..I'm..I'm)\nHo!.....Ho Go Go!\nHo!.....Ho (Hot..Hot.Hot,Hot)\nHo!.....Ho,Go Go!\nI'm really, really hot\nEvery time my records drop\nRadio says I won't stop\nCause I'm killin' em\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou don't know what you talking bout\nYou would think I was Suge when I come out\nMy album hit hard when I roll out\nY'all records make a bitch wanna throw em out, and that's no doubt\nSee I rock bells, Fly as hell and cool as zinfandel baby can't you tell\nI lick my lips like I'm LL\nAnd I'm doin it & doin it & doin it well\nStraight to the hotel\nI'm sober bitch so boy you gets no tail\nKiss kiss and still you gets nowhere\nJust two blue balls down in your underwear, I play unfair\nI'm a hot gal, fly cars and stars in strip bars it ain't hot if I'm not there\nI'm a true playa, you can find me up in any record store hurry up and get yours\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nLook, let me move to the left\nGo Head, let me feel myself\nTouch my chest my sweat\nShow the DJ how I shake my breast\nJiggle, Jiggle, Jangle\nWatch how my glu-te-us dangle\nI do a one-two step STOP!\nNo I ain't done yet\nEverybody in the club go to work\nTight jeans, crop shirts, short skirts\nI'm gone rock to the beat till it hurt\nI'm gone drop it on the street yeah you heard\nHaters I flip the bird, Got guns so what I ain't scurred\nI came to boogy and swerve, Hang-line folk that's my word\n\n[Hook]\n\nRelease...yourself\nRelease...yourself"}}, {"title": "Best Friends", "album": "Supa Dupa Fly ", "year": "1997-07-15", "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Aaliyah]\nMy best

sound so (fresh)\nI be the best don't second guess\nWhen it comes to other rappers bout it boy get flexed\nWhen I say I'm tight as wife beaters\nMissy bout to teach you how to follow the leader\nHit the club in a blue two seater\nLooking like I'm finna cock a nine millimeter\nGet out with my high hill cuffs\nTwisting my ass cause I know what guys want\nLicking my lips like I'm taking him home\nTeasing and teasing I'm faking the funk\nShaking my titties like I wanna bone\nBend over slow then I tell him I'm gone\n\n[Hook]", "image":

say what\nUh, uh, uh\nSay what, say what\nUh\nMissy, bring it in\n\n[Verse 1: Missy Elliot]\nWhy you played on me, wasn't I good enough for you (wasn't good enough)\nAll those other girls you've been with can't do like I do (doooo, doooo)\nGave you all my dough when you needed it all the time (uh huh)\nAnd if you planning on leaving me again\nThen give me a sign (say what, say what)\n\n[Hook: 702]\nBeep me 911 or call me on my cell phone (uh)\nI'll call you back\nTo see what you gon' tell me (say what, say what)\nYou don't wanna date\nNo ifs, ands, or waits it's over babe\n(Say what, say what, say what, say what)\nBeep me 911 or call me on my cell phone (uh)\nI'll call you back\nTo see what you gon' tell me (say what, say what)\nYou don't wanna date\nNo ifs, ands, or waits it's over babe (uh)\n\n[Verse 2: Missy Elliot]\nWhy you cheating on me, can you tell me what I've done\nI thought you was the one but you just a hit and run\nGave up clubs and parties, I put them aside (I stopped goin' to all the parties)\nLeft me in the dark with no kind of sign\n(Why don't you give me a sign?)\n\n[Hook]\nBeep me 911 or call me on my cell phone\nI'll call you back\nTo see what you gon' tell me\nYou don't wanna date\nNo ifs, ands, or waits it's over babe, it's over\n(No thinking twice)\n(Say what, say what)\nBeep me 911 or call me on my cell phone\nI'll call you back\nTo see what you gon' tell me\nYou don't wanna date\nNo ifs, ands, or waits it's over babe, it's over\n\n[Bridge: 702]\nAll my friends say I can do better than you (say what, say what)\nMaybe they was right cause I feel like a fool (fool, fool)\nBut I can't let you go until you take some time (say what, say what)\nTo tell me why you left me without a goddamn sign (say what, say what)\n\n[Hook]\nBeep me 911 or call me on my cell phone\nI'll call you back\nTo see what you gon' tell me\nYou don't wanna date\nNo ifs, ands, or waits it's over babe, it's over (uh huh, uh huh)\nBeep me 911 or call me on my cell phone\nI'll call you back\nTo see what you gon' tell me (say what)\nYou don't wanna date\nNo ifs, ands, or waits it's over babe, it's over\n(Magoo, Magoo)\n\n[Verse 3: Magoo]\nType of nigga made built to last\nLook homegirl I pump like gas when\nGet your friend and your girl and them (what)\nMy sex drive workout like a gym, Kim (what)\nWas the girl that I used to hit\nYou the girl that I gotta quit\nSee the kitty Kit\nGotta gold it like a light\nIn the night you the freak come out\nWe don't bite\nNo diggity, who took you out\nNo doubt when I first got down\nMade the bro' shout\nLook out, make it live\nDip and dive, staying alive\nShoot me sugar, there it is\nNow we talking square biz\nI'm leaving you without arrears\nBut I still luh the kids\nWhat you think, I'm hen pecked\nGirl

Kim kicks off the track with a fiery guest verse, which is actually quite interesting. Missy decided to have two established artists contributing to her album before she even graces the stage with first her finest vocals and then shows off her funky flow on the second verse. I imagine that having 2 major artists talking her up before she even says a word, is to really show that she deserves the hype (and the 2 Hype Williams directed music videos on her debut album)."},

Kim kicks off the track with a fiery guest verse, which is actually quite interesting. Missy decided to have two established artists contributing to her album before she even graces the stage with first her finest vocals and then shows off her funky flow on the second verse. I imagine that having 2 major artists talking her up before she even says a word, is to really show that she deserves the hype (and the 2 Hype Williams directed music videos on her debut album)."},

Production was helmed by Stewart and Nolan, with Elliott and Timbaland serving as co-producers and Eve having featured vocals.\n\nThe track was released as the album\u2019s fourth and final single and peaked at number two in the Netherlands and number five in the United Kingdom due to heavy airplay of the Basement Jaxx remix \u2013 Elliott\u2019s second highest charting single in the UK to date, after \u201cGet Ur Freak On\u201d.

up\nShow me some love, strip off your clothes, and take off your socks\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1: Missy Elliott]\nThe party's jumpin', I see something fine\nBoy I wanna kiss you, but I'm just too shy\nLet me dance with you, let me wear you out\nHere's a glass of orange juice, let's go X it out\nThe music's bangin', way down in my soul\nWhen you dance behind me, I lose all control\nMake me grind my hips, make me move my waist\nWhen the music comes on, you take my breath away\n\n[Chorus: Missy Elliott]\nThis is for my people, my party people\nThis is for my people, my motherfucking

and lick your face\nTake me on the dance floor to feel some ecstasy\nThe vibe is right now, and I'm bout to score\nMr. DJ can you play this joint once more\nCuz' I see the man I want, I want him right

his breath stink, freaky with his hands\nCocky with his mouth please like he got a fan\nCan't stand when a bitch all in my side\nI don't even know her and she all up in my light\nGivin me the side eye like she wanna fight\nPhilly known for boxing bitch better get it right\nCan't stand when a DJ fuckin up the song\nKnow I'm tryin to shake my ass all night long\nCuttin up the same shit all night

drinkin' Bloody Mary?\nBut shit, you betta hurry, before I have to bury\nMy attitude is bitchy, cuz my period is heavy\nI used to drive a Chevy, put twenties on that Bevy\nMy nigga was the shit, but then that stupid nigga left me\nAnd now I'm lovin' Larry, but Larry go with Terri\nAnd Terri is a freak, but it's his baby she will carry\nThe life he live's a fairy, cartoon like \"Tom and Jerry\"\nMy flow is legendary and your style is temporary\nYeah, you need to worry, like Jason, it gets scary\nThe words that I spit don't fit in that category\nIs my vision blurry? My speech is very slurry\nMe without Tim is like Jamaicans with no curry\nAnd yes, it's necessary, so hurry, nigga, hurry\nCuz when this album drops, you whack MC's will all get burried\n\n[Hook]\nFunky fresh dressed to impress ready to party\nFunky fresh dressed to impress (Turn the volume up)\nFunky fresh dressed to impress ready to party\nFunky fresh dressed to impress

volume up\nYes, turn the volume up\nThis is an exclusive (Turn the volume up)\n\n[Verse 1: Missy]\nIt's very necessary, on the contrary\nNo you do not scare me, is you drinkin' Bloody Mary?\nBut shit, you betta hurry, before I have to bury\nMy attitude is bitchy, cuz my period is heavy\nI used to drive a Chevy, put twenties on that Bevy\nMy nigga was the shit, but then that stupid nigga left me\nAnd now I'm lovin' Larry, but Larry go with Terri\nAnd Terri is a freak, but it's his baby she will carry\nThe life he live's a fairy, cartoon like \"Tom and Jerry\"\nMy flow is legendary and your style is temporary\nYeah, you need to worry, like Jason, it gets scary\nThe words that I spit don't fit in that category\nIs my vision blurry? My speech is very slurry\nMe without Tim is like Jamaicans with no curry\nAnd yes, it's necessary, so hurry, nigga, hurry\nCuz when this album drops, you whack MC's will all get burried\n\n[Hook]\nFunky fresh dressed to impress ready to party\nFunky fresh dressed to impress (Turn the volume up)\nFunky fresh dressed to impress ready to party\nFunky fresh dressed to impress (Turn the volume up)\nFunky fresh dressed to impress ready to party\nFunky fresh dressed to impress (Turn the volume up)\nFunky fresh dressed to impress ready to party\nFunky fresh dressed to impress (Turn the volume up)\n\n[Verse 2: Missy]\nYour style's very crummy, that's why you have no money\nYou always looking bummy, I don't care if you don't love me\nDon't try to come before me, unless you are a dummy\nRepeat, you'll lose your teeth and I would hate to call you gummy\nRainy or sunny, battle no way, honey\nThis not a game of Hide-and-Seek, go call ya mummy\nIt's about get so ugly, and I'mma keep y'all runnin'\nHiding from me, cuz you know you are weak\nYou ain't sayin' nothin', I keep it jumpin' jumpin'\nIn your Kenwoods, I'm bumpin' sumthin' in ya trunk'n\nYou can say I'm buggin', cuz when I come out bustin'\nThat's why y'all be discussin' who I like and who I'm fuckin'\n\nRepeat Chorus\n\n[Break: Timbaland]\nC'mon, c'mon\nC'mon, c'mon\nC'mon, c'mon\nFickidy, uh, uh, uh\nC'mon, c'mon\nC'mon, c'mon\n\n[Verse 3: Ms. Jade]\nI had a little homie named Paul Revere\nSmokes blunt after blunt, guzzled 40's of beer\nHe would swear up and down every first of the year\nHe was gon' quit smokin', but he never did\nWatch y'all huskey, it's about that time\nGettin' ready for the club 'round quarter til' nine\nCouple bottles of hypnotic in the back of the ride\nMight spit like a girl, but I hit like a guy\nMe and Missy ballin' up the avenue\nFunky fresh dressed to impress, we mackin' dudes\nMusic biz only reason I ain't jackin fools\nYou know bullshit walk and stackin' rules\nShit keeps drawin', the streets keep callin'\nDrink til' I'm nice and uh, uh-uh, on'n\nI'm bad luck, y'all mad cuz y'all suck\nPlease do not try to fuck with young duck\nPlease do not try to fuck with young duck\n\nRepeat Chorus"}}, {"title": "Bring the Pain", "album": "Under Construction", "year": "2002-11-12", "lyrics": "\"One two three four five six seven eight nine!\" - Chuck D\n\"Are we on the

you nada\nCause I got me a toy (Tooooy)\nAnd it works for me and it lasts longer than the battery\nSo you best believe that\n\n[Hook]\n\n[VERSE 3]\nI used to wish that you would love me\nAnd fantasize on how we used to be\nUntil I discovered something better than you\nI don't need, no need, your loving\nYou wanna come home late at night touchin' and feelin' all over me\nBut I don't need no help in pleasing me\nOh!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[OUTRO]\nHow could I miss you baby, I didn't even know you was gone\nIt's obvious you aren't needed in the bedroom anymore\nI'm just keeping myself occupied like all

This a jack move!\"\n\"Fried chicken, pork chops, chitlins, collard greens... What's wrong with you, eh? I have to get back to the kitchen. My cabbage is burning.\"\n\"Yeah, I want the cabbage and your collard greens. All of it. Right now.\"\n\"Besides, you're making me miss my favorite episode Fear Factor! I wonder if the ribs are done. You boys want to know chef's favorite recipe for musicals?\"\n\"I don't wanna know no chef recipe?! Go 'head. Get the pump! Gon' and get the pump.\"\n\"Well I tell you.

Oh I'm back!\" \"Now what now!\"\n\"It's easy as 1-2-3 play. Next, you mix [?] Qu'ran in a Bangladesh style bowl to make some Nissan Stewart. Mix some Campbell's soup...\"\n\"And then???\"\n\"...I prefer Warryn style myself personally. Add a pinch of Fantasia...\"\n\"And THEN???\"\n\"...and a Grand sized Puba. You sprinkle one Scoop Fatman throughout to add flavor and a dab of Soul Diggaz. Then you throw a tablespoon of Timbaland and half a Neptune smothered in hot Scott Storch dressing.\"\n\"We gon' smother you in some hot sauce. Whatever you said.\"\n\"...and you serve with a side order of Mike Jones.\"\n\"Mike Jones?\" \"Who?\" \"Mike Jones!\"\n\"It's best served with a cold [?] brew, whichever you prefer.

You know what I'm saying? So\nI'mma talk about this one I had a fewa years ago\n\nI had a friend named Cutie Tootie\nTootie turned tricks to get some Gucci\nKnown as loose bootie\nTruly, she was a freak in the evenin\nAnd if she wasn't teasin, then give me one reason\nWhy she do dat? Always knew dat\nShe was hot as da nectar\nHector said he pecked her, direspected her\nCause he bang bang swang in his dingalang\nBroke his back long range\nAnd make the ugly bitch sing\n\nOooh oooh\nWhy you hurtin me?\nTell me why more\nOooh oooh\nOooh oooh\nWhy you hurtin me?\nTell me why more\nOooh oooh\n\nCutie Tootie with her sight\nAnd if she humped Ralph\nShe humped Bobby, Ricky and Mike\nTight, is the way she wore her dresses\nHas she learned her lesson\nFrom all the dick testing\nNow I'm guessing\nShe's laying in a casket\nIn a yellow basket\nFor a Gucci jacket\nDaggit, I wish she didn't do those nasty things\nCause he made the ugly bitch sing\n\nChorus\n\nTootie didn't know the facts of life\nStaying up in clinics\nLoosy bootie made trife\nFeeling, she got the heeby geebies\nQuick to give you freebies\nUnderneath the staircase in Brooklyn\nNeighbors out the window sure was lookin\nShe greasy like chicken\nI don't give a cotton pick and\nShe can do her thing\nCause me and her don't hang\nThe ugly bitch sang\n\nChorus\n\nSo you know what? This should be a lesson for anybody\nWho's hanging with someone who's dirty, nasty, stank\nOnce again going around humping everybody\nEverybody and anybody and anything\nThat's why you make the ugly

me to realize\nThat I needed to be through' wit you (yea)\nCuz you're the reason I can't eat or sleep (yea)\nAll the girls you runnin' through (yea)\nUsed to be best friends, down wit'

myself, I'mma let you know\nYou don't play, games wit' me\nBut before I go, betta leave my dough\n\n[Missy - Verse Two]\nI'mma fool for you (yea)\nBut you seem to think my love's a joke (it ain't a joke boo)\nI get no love from you (yea)\nLike all these times I did before\nI think I'll pass on you (yea)\nBecause of the way you been actin' lately\nI get no cash from you (yea)\nIf you want me to stay, you must be cra-crazy\n\n[Repeat Hook]\n\n[Hook TWO]\nDedication\nIt was jus a bad relation (yes it was, yes it was)\nWhen I think it cuts my insides\nThe tears, they fall deep down from my

jaws, Peter shoulda stayed in his draws\nNow I'm out the door and you can't claim me no more\nThe loss is yours\nHow you gonna slumber wit' a bitch I'm supposed to be cool wit'\nWent to grade school wit', couldn't pay me to believe you hit it\nTo think I footed all the bills and now you breakin '\nStop accusin' me of that dumb shit I don't even participate in\nYou wasted my valuable time there's money to make\nScared to set foot in another relationship cuz of the heartache\nHeartbreak Hotel no not Faith, Kelly, and Whitney, no it's Brat, Aaliyah and\nMissy You miss me cuz we finished\nI'll just keep the keys to the 20 inch rim ride with the TVs in it\nYou don't need it, beat it, it's mine\nKiss my ass like your heart was in it (stupid ass)\nKeep stickin' them chickens\nSend Peter straight to the clinic nigga\n\n[Missy]\nSee I'mma give you your props tho\nYou like a bad ass motherfucker\nRunnin' two bitches at one time\nWhen I'm flyin' out, she flyin' in\nSayin' the same shit, spittin' the same game\nWho the fuck you think I am\nWilly Limpdick or somebody, forget you man\nThat's why us bitches gonna stick together\nBitch", "image":

I can't eat or sleep (yea)\nAll the girls you runnin' through (yea)\nUsed to be best friends, down wit' me\n\n[Hook]\nWhen I'm gone, you're alone\nYou stickin' them chickens 'til I get home\nWhen I'm home, you're wit' me\nKissin' on my ass, tryna be wit' me\nWell it's done, this I know\nSeen it for myself, I'mma let you know\nYou don't play, games wit' me\nBut before I go, betta leave my dough\n\n[Missy - Verse Two]\nI'mma fool for you (yea)\nBut you seem to think my love's a joke (it ain't a joke boo)\nI get no love from you (yea)\nLike all these times I did before\nI think I'll pass on you (yea)\nBecause of the way you been actin' lately\nI get no cash from you (yea)\nIf you want me to stay, you must be cra-crazy\n\n[Repeat Hook]\n\n[Hook TWO]\nDedication\nIt was jus a bad

more\nThe loss is yours\nHow you gonna slumber wit' a bitch I'm supposed to be cool wit'\nWent to grade school wit', couldn't pay me to believe you hit it\nTo think I footed all the bills and now you breakin '\nStop accusin' me of that dumb shit I don't even participate in\nYou wasted my valuable time there's money to make\nScared to set foot in another relationship cuz of the heartache\nHeartbreak Hotel no not Faith, Kelly, and Whitney, no it's Brat, Aaliyah and\nMissy You miss me cuz we finished\nI'll just keep the keys to the 20 inch rim ride with the TVs in it\nYou don't need it, beat it, it's mine\nKiss my ass like your heart was in it (stupid ass)\nKeep stickin' them chickens\nSend Peter straight to the clinic nigga\n\n[Missy]\nSee I'mma give you your props tho\nYou like a bad ass motherfucker\nRunnin' two bitches at one time\nWhen I'm flyin' out, she flyin' in\nSayin' the same shit, spittin' the same game\nWho the fuck you think I am\nWilly Limpdick or

Delicious\u201d is an album track from Missy Elliott\u2019s The Cookbook that not only samples Slick Rick\u2019s \u201cLick The Balls,\u201d but it also features Missy trading verses with the legendary storytelling rapper himself.\n\nKnown for his outlandish tales, Slick Rick wraps this one in meta references. This time, he spins a hilarious (and clearly fictional) story about giving in to being seduced by Missy Elliott in the studio after being invited to do a guest rap on her song.\n\nMissy alternates between coy singing parts and raunchy rap verses imitating Rick\u2019s British accent. The combination of the two feels natural given Rick\u2019s place in hip-hop history, and Missy\u2019s deep respect for all things old-school hip-hop."}, "comment_count": 0, "community": true,

you a hug (let's stick together)\nI got problems just like you (woo, ooh, yeah)\nAnd everybody needs some love\n\n[Verse 2: Dorinda Clark Cole]\nWhen you're feeling bad, some friends they can't be found\n(Look around, look around, be found)\nCause some people love it just to see you when you're down\nBut it's ok, pick yourself up, start over again\n(That's what you gotta do)\nIf you try you will, you will succeed in the end\n(The end, I know you will, oh yeah)\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Bridge: Missy Elliott]\nShake a hand, shake a hand y'all, come on (oh shake somebody's hand)\nTo every woman, every

life)\nAnd your self esteem might be low from what people say\n(Keep holding on)\nHold your head up high, I promise it's gonna be ok\n\n[Hook]\nI'm not perfect just like you (I'm not perfect)\nSo come on let me give you a hug (come on let me give you a hug)\nI got problems just like you (I got problems)\nSo don't nobody sit here and judge (just like you)\nI'm not perfect just like you (we're gonna stick together)\nSo come on let me give you a hug (let's stick together)\nI got problems just like you (woo, ooh, yeah)\nAnd everybody needs some love\n\n[Verse 2: Dorinda Clark Cole]\nWhen you're feeling bad, some friends they can't be found\n(Look around, look around, be found)\nCause some people love it just to see you when you're down\nBut it's ok, pick yourself up, start over again\n(That's what you gotta do)\nIf you try you will, you will succeed in the end\n(The end, I know you will, oh yeah)\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Bridge: Missy Elliott]\nShake a hand, shake a hand y'all, come on (oh shake somebody's hand)\nTo every woman, every man y'all, come on (oh, to every woman, every man)\nTell a friend, tell a friend y'all (ooh, shake a hand with someone)\n'Cause united we stand y'all

down, get up, then I gotta dust it off\nSay you dust it off?!\nYeah I quickly dust it off\nI'm off the walls, I do brawls\nI don't stall, yes it's on\nSaid it strong, I can't be cloned\nYou can call

Misdemeanor okay\nCall me 4 play, position more than 40 ways\nLike a chocolate glaze, I'm hotter than a summer day\nStingray, Sugar Ray\nKnuckles all up in your face\n\n[Chorus]\nWho dat, who dat,

new wheels\nI wear high hills, I touch and feel\nCatch me in your mans grill\nMy record deal, my movie deal\nIs super sick-sick, I click-click\nAnd if you doubt me I'll click-click\nSmack dem boi's, I
