believe you ain't here\nSometimes it's just hard for a nigga to wake up\nIt's hard to just keep goin'\nIt's like I feel empty inside without you bein' here\nI would do anything man, to bring you back\nI'd give all this shit, shit the whole lot\nI saw your son today, he look just like you\nYou was the greatest, you'll always be the greatest\nI miss you B.I.G\nCan't wait til that day, when I see your face again\nI can't wait til that day, when I see your face again\nYeah, this right here (tell me why)\nGoes out to everyone that has lost someone\nThat they truly loved (c'mon, check it out)\n\n[Verse 1: Puff Daddy]\nSeems like yesterday we used to rock the show\nI laced the track, you locked the flow\nSo far from hangin' on the block for dough\nNotorious, they got to know that\nLife ain't always what it seem to be\nWords can't express what you mean to me\nEven though you're gone, we still a team\nThrough your family, I'll fulfill your dream (that's right)\nIn the future, can't wait to see\nIf you open up the gates for me\nReminisce some time, the night they took my friend\nTry to black it out, but it plays again\nWhen it's real, feelings hard to conceal\nCan't imagine all the pain I feel\nGive anythin' to hear half your breath\nI know you still livin' your life after death\n\n[Refrain: Faith Evans]\nEvery step I take, every move I make\nEvery single day, every time I pray\nI'll be missin' you\nThinkin' of the day when you went away\nWhat a life to take, what a bond to break\nI'll be missin' you\n\n[Verse 2: Puff Daddy]\nIt's kinda hard with you not around\nKnow you in heaven, smilin' down\nWatchin' us while we pray for you\nEvery day we pray for you\n'Til the day we meet again\nIn my heart is where I'll keep you, friend\nMemories give me the strength I need to proceed\nStrength I need to believe\nMy thoughts Big I just can't define\nWish I could turn back the hands of time\nUs in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks\nYou and me takin' flicks\nMakin' hits, stages they receive you on\nStill can't believe you're gone\nGive anything to hear half your breath\nI know you still livin' your life after death\n\n[Refrain: Faith Evans]\nEvery step I take, every move I make (I miss you)\nEvery single day, every time I pray\nI'll be missin' you\nThinkin' of the day when you went away\nWhat a life to take, what a bond to break\nI'll be missin' you\n\n[Interlude: Faith Evans]\nSomebody tell me why\nOne black morning\nWhen this life is over\nI know I'll see your face\n\n[Bridge: 112 & Puff Daddy]\nEvery night I pray, every step I take\nEvery move I make, every single day\nEvery night I pray, every step I take\nEvery day that passes\nEvery move I make, every single day\nIs a day that I get closer\nTo seeing you again\nEvery night I pray, every step I take\nWe miss you B.I.G., and we won't stop\nEvery move I make, every single day\n'Cause we can't stop, that's right\nEvery night I pray, every step I take\nEvery move I make, every single day\nWe miss you B.I.G\n\n[Refrain: Faith Evans]\nEvery step I take, every move I make (I miss you)\nEvery single day, every time I pray\nI'll be missin' you\nThinkin' of the day when you went away\nWhat a life to take, what a bond to break\nI'll be missin' you (we miss you)\n\n[Outro]\nEvery step I take, every move I make (I miss you)\nEvery single day, every time I pray\nI'll be missing you\nThinkin' of the day when you went away\nWhat a life to take, what a bond to break\nI'll be missin' you", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d5238047e49073d1f03cdf209aaf9ce1.500x497x1.jpg",

keep goin'\nIt's like I feel empty inside without you bein' here\nI would do anything man, to bring you back\nI'd give all this shit, shit the whole lot\nI saw your son today, he look just like you\nYou was the greatest, you'll always be the greatest\nI miss you B.I.G\nCan't wait til that day, when I see your face again\nI can't wait til that day, when I see your face again\nYeah, this right here (tell me why)\nGoes out to everyone that has lost someone\nThat they truly loved (c'mon, check it out)\n\n[Verse 1: Puff Daddy]\nSeems like yesterday we used to rock the show\nI laced the track, you locked the flow\nSo far from hangin' on the block for dough\nNotorious, they got to know that\nLife ain't always what it seem to be\nWords can't express what you mean to me\nEven though you're gone, we still a team\nThrough your family, I'll fulfill your dream (that's right)\nIn the future, can't wait to see\nIf you open up the gates for me\nReminisce some time, the night they took my friend\nTry to black it out, but it plays again\nWhen it's real, feelings hard to conceal\nCan't imagine all the pain I feel\nGive anythin' to hear half your breath\nI know you still livin' your life after death\n\n[Refrain: Faith Evans]\nEvery step I take, every move I make\nEvery single day, every time I pray\nI'll be missin' you\nThinkin' of the day when you went away\nWhat a life to take, what a bond to break\nI'll be missin' you\n\n[Verse 2: Puff Daddy]\nIt's kinda hard with you not around\nKnow you in heaven, smilin' down\nWatchin' us while we pray for you\nEvery day we pray for you\n'Til the day we meet again\nIn my heart is where I'll keep you, friend\nMemories give me the strength I need to proceed\nStrength I need to believe\nMy thoughts Big I just can't define\nWish I could turn back the hands of time\nUs in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks\nYou and me takin' flicks\nMakin' hits, stages they receive you on\nStill can't believe you're gone\nGive anything to hear half your breath\nI know you still livin' your life after death\n\n[Refrain: Faith Evans]\nEvery step I take, every move I make (I miss you)\nEvery single day, every time I pray\nI'll be missin' you\nThinkin' of the day when you went away\nWhat a life to take, what a bond to break\nI'll be missin' you\n\n[Interlude: Faith Evans]\nSomebody tell me why\nOne black morning\nWhen this life is over\nI know I'll see your face\n\n[Bridge: 112 & Puff Daddy]\nEvery night I pray, every step I take\nEvery move I make, every single day\nEvery night I pray, every step I take\nEvery day that passes\nEvery move I make, every single day\nIs a day that I get closer\nTo seeing you again\nEvery night I pray, every step I take\nWe miss you B.I.G., and we won't stop\nEvery move I make, every single day\n'Cause we can't stop, that's right\nEvery night I pray, every step I take\nEvery move I make, every single day\nWe miss you B.I.G\n\n[Refrain: Faith Evans]\nEvery step I take, every move I make (I miss you)\nEvery single day, every time I pray\nI'll be missin' you\nThinkin' of the day when you went away\nWhat a life to take, what a bond to break\nI'll be missin' you (we miss you)\n\n[Outro]\nEvery step I take, every move I make (I miss you)\nEvery single day, every time I pray\nI'll be missing you\nThinkin' of the day when you went away\nWhat a life to take, what a bond to break\nI'll be missin' you"}}, {"title": "Coming Home", "album": "Last Train to Paris", "year": "2010-11-21", "lyrics": "[Hook: Skylar Grey]\nI'm coming home, I'm coming home\nTell the world I'm coming home\nLet the rain wash away\nAll the pain of yesterday\nI know my kingdom awaits\nAnd they've forgiven my mistakes\nI'm coming home, I'm coming home\nTell the world I'm coming\n\n[Intro: Diddy]\nI'm back where I belong (yeah)\nI never felt so strong, man (I'm back, baby)\nI feel like there's nothing I can't try\nAnd if you feel me put your hands high (put your hands high)\nIf you ever lost a light before, this one's for you\n(Baby, put your hands high)\nAnd you, the dreams are for you\n\n[Verse 1: Diddy]\nI hear the \"Tears of a Clown,\" uh, I hate that song\nI always feel like they're talking to me, when it comes on (come on)\nAnother day, another dawn\nAnother Keisha, nice to meet ya, get the math, I'm gone\nWhat am I supposed to do when the club lights come on?\nIt's easy to be Puff but it's harder to be Sean\nWhat if my twins ask why I ain't marry their mom?\nDamn, how do I respond?\nWhat if my son stares with a face like my own\nAnd says he wants to be like me when he's grown?\nShit! But I ain't finished growing\nAnother night, the inevitable prolongs\nAnother day, another dawn\nJust tell Keisha and Teresa I'll be better in the morn'\n(I'll be better in the morn')\nAnother lie that I carry on\nI need to get back to the place where I belong\n\n[Hook: Skylar Grey]\nI'm coming home, I'm coming home\nTell the world that I'm coming home\nLet the rain wash away\nAll the pain of yesterday\nI know my kingdom awaits\nAnd they've forgiven my mistakes\nI'm coming home, I'm coming home\nTell the world I'm coming\n\n[Verse 2: Diddy]\n\u201cA House Is Not a Home,\u201d I hate this song\nIs a house really a home when your loved ones is gone?\nAnd niggas got the nerve to blame you for it\nAnd you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it\nBut you felt it, and still feel it\nAnd money can't make up for it or conceal it\nBut you deal with it (deal with it), and you keep ballin'\nPour out some liquor, playboy, and we keep ballin' (ballin')\nBaby, we been living in sin\nCause we been really in love, but we been living as friends\nSo you've been a guest in your own home\nIt's time to make your house your home\nPick up your phone, come on\n\n[Hook: Skylar Grey]\nI'm coming home, I'm coming home\nTell the world that I'm coming home\nLet the rain wash away\nAll the pain of yesterday\nI know my kingdom awaits\nAnd they've forgiven my mistakes\nI'm coming home, I'm coming home\nTell the world I'm coming\n\n[Verse 3]\n\u201cAin\u2019t No Stopping Us Now,\u201d I love that song\nWhenever it comes on, it makes me feel strong\nI thought I told y'all that we won't stop\nTil we back cruisin through Harlem, these old blocks\nIt's what made me, saved me, drove me crazy\nDrove me away, then embraced me\nForgave me for all of my shortcomings\nWelcome to my homecoming\nYeah, it's been a long time coming\nLot of fights, lot of scars, lot of bottles\nLot of cars, lot of ups, lot of downs\nMade it back, lost my dog (I miss you Big!)\nBut here I stand (here I stand), a better man\nThank you, Lord! Thank you all!\n\n[Hook: Skylar Grey]\nI'm coming home, I'm coming home\nTell the world that I'm coming home\nLet the rain wash away\nAll the pain of yesterday\nI know my kingdom awaits\nAnd they've forgiven my mistakes\nI'm coming home, I'm coming home\nTell the world I'm coming", "image": "https://images.genius.com/eb1fc48a136a9ccd12db01d345a9d8a2.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Puff Daddy",

what y'all wanna do?\nWanna be ballers, shot callers, brawlers\nWho be dippin' in the Benz with the spoilers\nOn the low from the Jake in the Taurus\nTryin' to get my hands on some Grants like Horace\nYeah, livin' the raw deal\nThree course meals: spaghetti, fettuccine, and veal\nBut still, everything's real in the field\nAnd what you can't have now, leave in your will\nBut don't knock me for tryin' to bury\nSeven zeros over in Rio Di Janeiry\nAin't nobody's hero, but I wanna be heard\nOn your Hot 9-7 every day, that's my word\nSwimmin' in women with they own condominiums\nFive plus five's, who drive Millenniums\nIt's all about the Benjamins, what\nI get a fifty pound bag of Euk for the mutts\nFive carats on my hands with the cuts\nIn something European chromed out with a clutch, what\n\n[Verse 2: Jadakiss]\nI wanna hold figures, fuck being a broke nigga\nDrinkin' malt liquor, drivin' a broke Viga\nI'm with Mo' sippers, watched by gold diggers\nRocking Girbaud denims with gold zippers\nLost your touch, we kept ours, poppin' Cristals\nFreakin' the three-quarter reptiles\nEnormous cream, forest green Benz jeep\nFor my team so while you sleep I'ma scheme\nWe see through, that's why nobody never gon' believe you\nYou should do what we do, stack chips like Hebrews\nDon't let the melody intrigue you, 'cause I leave you\nI'm only here for that green paper with the eagle\n\n[Verse 3: Sheek Louch]\nI'm strictly tryin' to cop those colossal-sized Picasso's\nAnd have papi flip coke outside Delgado's\nTienda, with cash flowin' like Sosa\nAnd a Latin chick transportin' in the chocha\nStampedin' over, pop Mo's, never sober\nFlexin' Range Rovers dealin' weight by Minnesota\nAvoidin' narcs with camcorders and Chevy Novas\nStash in the building with this chick named Willona\nFrom Daytona, when I was young I wanted to bone her\nBut now I only hit chicks who win beauty pageants\nTrickin' and takin' me skiin' at the Aspens, uh\nGangsta mental, stay poppin' Cristal\nPack a black pistol in the Ac' coupe that's dark brown\nPinkie ringin', gondolas with the man singin'\nItalian music down the river with your chick clingin'\nTo my bizzalls, player, you mad false\nActin' hard when you as pussy as RuPaul's\n\n[Hook]\nIt's all about the Benjamins, baby\nIt's all about the Benjamins, baby\nNow, what y'all wanna do?\nIt's all about the Benjamins, baby\nWanna be ballers, shot-callers\nIt's all about the Benjamins, baby\nBrawlers, who be dippin' in the Benz with the spoilers\nIt's all about the Benjamins, baby\nOn the low from the Jake in the Taurus\n\n[Verse 4: Lil' Kim]\nUh, uh, what the blood clot\nWanna bumble with the Bee, huh?\nBzzz, throw a hex on the whole family\nDressed in all black like The Omen\nHave your friends singin', \"This is for my homie\"\nAnd you know me from makin' niggas so sick\nFloss in my Six, with the 'Lex on the wrist\nIf it's murder, you know she wrote it\nGerman Ruger for yo' ass, bitch, deepthroat it\nKnow you wanna feel the womb 'cause it's platinum-coated\nTake your pick, got a firearm you shoulda toted, suck a dick\nAll that bullshit you kick, player-hatin' from the sidelines\nGet your own shit, why you ridin' mine?\nI'm a Goodfella kinda lady\nStash 380's in Mercedes, Puffy, hold me down, baby!\nOnly female in my crew and I kick shit like a nigga do\nPull the trigger too, fuck you!\n\n[Verse 5: The Notorious B.I.G.]\nUh, uh, uh, I been had skills, Cristal spills\nHide bills in Brazil, about a mill', the ice grill\nMake it hard to figure me, liquor be kickin' me\nIn my asshole; undercover, Donnie Brasco\nLeft my East Coast girl the Bentley to twirl (uh-huh)\nWhile my West Coast shorty push the chrome 740\nRockin' Redman and Naughty, oh, where my kitty cat?\nHalf a brick of yay in the bra where her titties at\nAnd I'm livin' that for life, we push weight\nFuck the state pen, fuck hoes at Penn State\nListen close, it's Francis, the Praying Mantis\nAttack with the MAC, my left hand spit\nRight hand grip on the whip for the smooth getaway\nPlayer haters, get away or my lead will spray\nSqueeze off 'til I'm empty, don't tempt me\nOnly to Hell I send thee, all about the Benjis, what\n\n[Outro]\nIt's all about the Benjamins, baby\nIt's all about the Benjamins, baby\nIt's all about the Benjamins, baby\nIt's all about the Benjamins, baby\nIt's all about the

Diddy]\nYeah, is that bounce right here\nTime to move on, time to be strong\nDon't stop now, straight to the top now\nSomeone who truly understands\nHow to treat a man\nThis is what I need\n\n[Verse 1: P Diddy]\nGirl you made me believe again\nIf you happy then be with him, go 'head mommy breathe again\nGo 'head mommy breathe again, don't stop now straight to the top now\nGo 'head mommy make it hot now\nI need me a love that's 'gon make my heart stop now\nAnd what I need is simple, five foot five with dimples\nPotential wife credentials\nKnow about the life I'm into, life I've been through\nAnd how I had a trifilin mental\nSo ride with me, G Force fly with me\nTimes get hard cry with me, die with me\nWhite beach sands lye with me\nMy advice is forget the limelight\nLet's make love, while we listen to Frank White\nSo tight, now I understand life\n\n[Hook:  Ginuwine , Mario Winans & (P Diddy)]\nWhat I need\n(Yeah take that)\nIs a pretty woman next to me\nA pretty woman yeah baby\nTo share the dreams that I Believe\n(Dream with me, believe in me)\nMaybe we could start a family\nStart a family baby\nSomeone who truly understands, how to treat a man\nThis is what I need\n\n[Verse 2: Loon & (P Diddy)]\nListen to me now what should I say now? Come on ma\nBeen a whole day now I wanna lay 'round\nAnd sip coladas, dipped in Prada\nI'm smooth as Erik Estrada, dipped in dollars\nWe out in Vegas Nevada, bubble bath in the champagne glass\n'Bout the size of a campaign ad\nYou don't know how you look to me\nBut if love was a crime you be a crook to me\nCause mommy I've done been around the world\nSeened alot of places\nBeen around your girl believe I read faces\nI can tell she don't want me prevail\nBut I, learn my lesson watchin Sean stressin'\nSo why listen to her and start guessin?\nMommy you ain't ready to ride then start dressin\nI need a girl 2 receive my mom's blessin\nConfession, my love no contestin\nI need affection\n(Yes I need affection, let's go Mario!)\n\n[Bridge: Mario Winans]\nGirl what the hell is on your mind?\nI could be dumb but I'm not blind\nThere's something leaking in your mind\nDon't look to good for you and me, always getting weak\nThat ain't what I need, baby!!!\n\n\n[Hook: Mario Winans]\nWhat I need baby\nIs a pretty woman next to me\nA pretty woman yeah baby\nTo share the dreams that I Believe\nI need a girl in my life\nMaybe we could start a family\nStart a family baby\nSomeone who truly understands, how to treat a man\nHow to treat a man\nThis is what I need\n\n[Verse 3: P Diddy]\nAy yo, the sun don't shine forever\nBut as long as were here then we might as well shine together\nNevermind the weather, go somewhere and get our minds together\nBuild a love that'll last forever\nSo let's stop the pain, stop the rain\nPut stress to rest girl, stop the games\nName the spot, mommy I got the plane\nRoll through rough, I got the Range\nMa I got some thangs, knowned to put rocks in rings\nPushing hundred foot yachts and thangs\nYour man don't play, have you ever been to Saint Tropez\nOr seen a brotha play a Mandolay?\nGirl I wanna just look in your eyes and watch the sun rise\nNo more lies, no more tears to cry\nNo more reasons for leavin, you I believe in\nLove you till the day I stop breathing\nI love you girl\n\n[Outro:  Ginuwine and Mario Winans]\nThis is what I need\nIs a pretty woman next to me\nA pretty woman next to me\nTo share the dreams that I believe\nWhen I wake up in the morning\nMaybe we could start a family\nI wanna see your pretty face\nSomeone who truly understands, how to treat a man\nOh yeah oh yeah\nThis is what I need\nIs a pretty woman next to me\nTo share the dreams that I believe\nSomeone who truly understands, how to treat a man\nThis is what I need baby\nIs a pretty woman next to me\nStanding next to me\nTo share the dreams that I Believe\nWhen I wake up in the morning\nMaybe we could start a family\nI wanna see your pretty face baby\nSomeone who truly understands, how to treat a man\nOh yeah oh yeah\nThis is

Diddy]\nI had a girl that would've died for me\nDidn't 'preciate her so I made her cry for me\nEvery night she had tears in her eyes for me\nQuarter K's, shorty took the whole ride for me\nFirst we were friends then became lovers\nYou was more than my girl, we was like brothers\nAll night we would play fight under covers\nNow you gone, can't love you like I really wanna\nBut every time I think about your pretty smile\nAnd how we used to drive the whole city wild\nDamn I wish you would've had my child\nA pretty little girl wit Diddy's smile\nThis shit is wild\nAll dem days that I reminisce\nAbout the way I use to kiss dem pretty lips\nBut as long as you happy, I'mma tell you this\nI love you girl and you're the one that I will always miss\nI love you, yeah\n\n[Chorus:

wanna be the one you respect, even when you're vexed\nRock Versace silks over a steel V-neck\nGot green never seen so you suck my jewels\nClutch my uz', anything I touch I bruise\nPuff make his own laws, nigga fuck your rules (that's right)\nGoodfellas, you know you can't touch us dudes\n\n[Hook: Puff & Mase]\nDon't push us, 'cause we're close to the, edge\nWe're tryin', not to lose our heads, a-hah hah hah hah\n\n[Verse 2: Mase]\nBroken glass everywhere\nIf it ain't about the money, Puff, I just don't care (that's right)\nI'm that goodfella fly guy, sometimes wiseguys\nSpend time in H-A-W-A-I-I\n(Mase can you please stop smoking la la?)\nPuff why try? I'm a thug, I'mma die high\nI be out in Jersey, puffin' Hershey\nBrothers ain't worthy to rock my derby\nThough I'm never drug free when I'm the club, G\nThough I know the thug be wantin' to slug me (uh-huh)\nCould it be I move as smoove as Bugsy? (yeah)\nOr be at the bar with too much bubbly? (c'mon)\nYo I think it must be the girls want to lust me\nOr is it simply the girls just love me\nBrothers wanna: rock the rolls, rock my clothes\nRock my ice, pull out Glocks, stop my life (uhh)\nI'm like, \"Damn, how these niggas got that trife?\nUsed to be my man, how he gonna plot on my wife?\"\nDo you think he snake me 'cause he hate me?\nOr he got his Ph.D; Player Hatin' Degree? (Ahaha!)\n\n[Bridge: Puff]\nCan't nobody take my pride\nUh-uh, uh-uh\nCan't nobody hold me down... ohh no\nI got to keep on movin'\n\n[Verse 3: Puff]\nQuit that! (uh-huh) You a big cat?

(who?)\nBet against us? (Not a sure bet)\nWe make hits that'll rearrange your whole set (that's right)\nAnd got a Benz that I ain't even drove yet\n\n[Hook: Puff & Mase]\nDon't push us, 'cause we're close to the, edge\nWe're tryin', not to, lose our heads, a-hah-hah-hah-hah\n\n[Mase and (Puff)]\nI get the feeling sometime, it make me wonder\nWhy you wanna take us under\n(Why you wanna take us under?)\nI get the feeling sometime, it make me wonder\nWhy you wanna take us under\n(Why you wanna take us under?)\n\n[Bridge: Puff]\nCan't nobody take my pride\nUh-uh, uh-uh\nCan't nobody hold me down... ohh no\nI got to keep on movin'\n(Repeat until end)"}}, {"title": "Bad Boy For Life", "album": "The Saga Continues...", "year": "2001-11-27", "lyrics": "[Intro: P.

Diddy]\nAyo, you ready?\nLet's do it\n\n[Verse 1: P. Diddy]\nI'm the definition of \"half man, half drugs\"\nAsk the clubs, Bad Boy, that's wussup\nAfter bucks, crush crews after us\nNo games, we ain't laughing much\nNothing but big things, check the hit list\nHow we twist shit, what changed but the name?\nWe still here, you rockin' with the best\nDon't worry if I write rhymes, I write checks (Ha!)\nWho's the boss? Dudes is lost\nDon't think cause I'm iced out, I'mma cool off\nWho else but me? And if you don't feel me\nThat mean you can't touch me, it's ugly, trust me\nGet it right, dawg, we ain't ever left\nWe just moved in silence and repped to the death\nIt's official, I survive what I been through\nY'all got trauma, the saga continues\n\n[Hook]\nWe ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere\nWe can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life\nWe ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere\nWe can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life\n\n[Verse 2: Black Rob]\nHey yo straight from the Harlem streets\nI don't play, I push it down with the Harlem Heat\nAll a sudden niggas got a problem wit me\nThey run around actin like the Black-o can't eat\nAnd you know what? For some strange reason\nI'm off of this medication, feeling deranged needing\nFor y'all to put the word out, we ain't leavin'\nWe trying to be rich before we all stop breathing\nTherefore we kinda hustle lames\nStay laying down our muscle games\nStill turn niggas dreams to flames, you got the wire\nIf not I ain't sayin no names; you'll soon expire\nNo pain, nothing, I feel remorse\nYes of course it's me and Diddy up first racing Porsches\nWith the big twin valve exhausts\nOn the cover of your Vibes, XXLs, and Sources, bitch\n\n[Hook]\nWe ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere\nWe can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life\nWe ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere\nWe can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life\n\n[Verse 3: Mark Curry]\nIt ain't shit changed, since the Notorious (we miss you Big)\nSee everything still glorious\nWe still got warriors, still be the victorious\nSee it's a lot of them, but it's more of us\nStill got cash to blow, raps to flow\nStill them cats that know, pack yo' flow\nThat's fo' sho', bottles that pop, joints that rock\nPlayed the background, hand on my jock, holdin' my Glock\nMoney to get, cars to flip\nBars to sit at and sip Cognac wit jewels that drip\nHoes to see, make sure they knowin' it's me\nDrop that beat, can't believe that I MC\nBad boy 'til the casket drop, gotta love it\nPlace nothing above it, it's on like that\nDon't believe, we ain't gone like that\nWe're always gonna be here\nWe there every motherfucking year!\n\n[Hook]\nWe ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere\nWe can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life\nWe ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere\nWe can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life\nWe ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere\nWe can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life\nWe ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere\nWe can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life\n\n[Outro]\nWe ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere\nWe can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life"}}, {"title": "Big Homie", "album": "No Way Out 2", "year": null, "lyrics": "[Intro: PUFF DADDY]\nDon't be afraid to get old, man\nYou may learn some shit\nYou may know some shit\nYou may see some shit\nHaha\nBitch showed me how it's old\nI had to tell her\n\n[Hook: Diddy]\nYou could go to any hood, bet they know me\nRose gold pinky ring;

say\nYou're everything I want it to be\nIf you could only see, your heart belongs to me\nI love you so much, I'm yearning for your touch\nCome and set me free, forever yours I'll be\nBaby won't you

mind that\nFunny never find that, Puff a dime stack\nWrite hot shit and make a nigga say, rewind that\nNiggas know, we go against the Harlem Gigolo\nGetcha ho, lick her low, make the bitch hit the door\nI represent honeys with money fly guys with gems\nDrive with the tints that be thirty-five percent\nHoes hope I lay so I look both ways\nCop says okay my tint smoke gray\nNo way, nigga leave

for\nPain can make you wanna love no more\n\n[Refrain: Diddy]\nLovin' you no more\nI just, I can't, I just can\u2019t be lovin' you no more\nI love you more than I love myself\nLovin' you no more\nI just, I can't, I just can\u2019t be lovin' you no more\nI love you more than I love myself\n\n[Verse 1: Diddy]\nHurt with the heart that's bleeding slowly\nSo many lonely sleepless nights\nI'm going through hell to convince she love me\nBut never her approval no matter how I try\nThe way you talk to me but still I say I love you\nI\u2019m ashamed you can see it in my eyes\nMomma always told me to respect the woman\nBut what am I about to do when her parents do not try\n\n[Bridge 1: Dirty Money]\nSo many tears I cried\nBut all for nothin' I\u2019m afraid to say\nOh\n\n[Refrain: Diddy & Dirty Money]\nLovin' you no more\nI just, I can't, I just can\u2019t be lovin' you no more (I can't)\nI love you more than I love myself (no, woah)\nLovin' you no more (I can't)\nI just, I can't, I just can\u2019t be loving you no more (no, no, baby)\nI love you more than I love myself\n\n[Verse 2: Diddy]\nI\u2019ve been so dependent on your love for so long\nPunishment for me is tryin' to let go\nGive it from your heart is what you taught me\nAddiction to pain is what it got me\nMy life, now it's changed\nMy life, ain't the same as you are\nHeartbroke to the point sometimes wanna end it\nIf I can\u2019t have what mean most to me\n\n[Bridge 1: Dirty Money]\nSo many tears I cried (I cried)\nBut all for nothing I\u2019m afraid to say\nOh, oh, oh\n\n[Hook: Diddy & Dirty Money & Drake]\nLovin' you no more\nI just, I can't, I just can\u2019t be lovin' you no more (I can't)\nI love you more than I love myself\nLovin' you no more  (I can't) (Diddy)\nI just, I can't, I just can\u2019t be lovin' you no more (no, no, baby) (Drizzy baby, uh uh)\nI love you more than I love myself\n\n[Verse 3: Drake]\nUh, tryin' not to over think\nOnly 'cause I drove and I've had a lot to drink\nWhen I wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink\nAnd there\u2019s pieces of ya hair still sittin' in my sink\nAnd you still got underwear that\u2019s sittin' in the dryer\nHow come every time that you\u2019re suspicious I\u2019m a liar?\nYou stand out, I can hear you whistle in a choir\nAnd that\u2019s the only reason you the Mrs. I admire\nDamn. Tell me what I\u2019m gon' do?\nSince everythin' that I\u2019m trying to forget is all true\nMe and all your main girls get along too\nI would take my last dollar out and bet it on you\nBut uh, you see the same one I\u2019m missing\nIs basically the reason I became something different\nAnd just that I remember me before\nAnd if you could do the same, baby, then we\u2019d be for sure\n\n[Bridge 2: Dirty Money]\nSo selfishly, you can only show feelings\nWhen you feel yours in jeopardy\nOh, time, oh, time has changed and I\u2019m no longer willing\nCan't you see how my heart is bleeding?\nI guess I\u2026\n\n[Hook: Diddy & Dirty Money]\nLovin' you no more\nI just, I can't, I just can\u2019t be lovin' you no more (no, lovin' you no more)\nI love you more than I love myself (no, no)\nLovin' you no more (I can't)\nI just, I can't, I just can\u2019t be lovin' you no more (no, woah)\nI love you more than I love myself\nLovin' you no more (oh, no)\nI just, I can't, I just can\u2019t be lovin' you no more\nI love you more than I love myself\nLovin' you no more\nI just, I can't, I just can\u2019t be lovin' you no more (just wanna love you baby)\nI love you more than I love myself

mistakes\nNo matter what, you've always been by my side\nYou've always been my best friend\nYou're the love of my life (Oh)\nYou're everything to me (Oh)\nYou never left my side (You're my best friend)\nI love you so much (Yes, you are)\nYou're my best friend\n\n[Puffy]\nSince the beginning of time\nAll you did was bless men\nToo young to understand but now you my best friend\nHow could they doubt you, never think about you\nDon't they know nothing's possible without you\n\nFaith without fear that's how they raised me\nWords of man kill but never phase me\nGrateful for wisdom that you gave me\nBut still I'm like, dear God I wonder, could you save me?\nToo much sinning, gotta be more than plush living\nGotta be more than grabbing nines to buck tin in\nGotta be more than just to lust women\nGotta be more than platinum Rolexes, 600's and crushed linen\nPraise your name, I know some of them hate their due\nJudgment day, don't they know they can't escape your crew\nI'm just trying to live right and pray you take me through\nAnd with this song I dedicate to you, my Lord\n\n1 - [Mario Winans]\nLord, you mean the world to me\nBefore I was born you chose me\nYou always hear me when I'm calling\nEven catch me when I'm falling\nYou're the closest one to me\nI surrender all to thee\nI want the whole wide world to see\nThat we've always been and we'll always be\nBest friends\n\n[Puffy]\nSometimes I reminisce and wonder how I made it this far\nBecause of you, I'm me, so you the real star\nYour hindsight, the time's right to get my mind tight\nThen give it to you and let it shine bright\nMy best friend, only know how to teach the truth\nPlant the seeds of life and let them eat the fruit\nCan't you see that He spread love for you\nShed blood for you, cry for and die for you\nWillies with mac millies know how you get down\nWe know the drama you bring whenever you hit town\nJust remember when you pray, God is love\nGracious, merciful, forgive even the hardest thugs\nLife as we know it, it all begins with Him\nLife as we know it, it all ends with Him\nIf I was you I would never try to pretend with Him\nHe might spaz and blow it, I'm best friends with him\n\nRepeat 1\n\n[Puffy]\nBeen two and a half years since my man Big passed\nBeen two and a half years since my world crashed\nI needed help, God gave me the power\nGave me the strength to go face to face with my darkest hour\nLooked me in the eyes and ask \"What you doing unhappy?\"\n\"Don't you know why I'm here?\" and started shooting at me\nBack to the wall, is my faith gonna play out\nNever wavered once, gave me no way out\nYour time to die, don't even stress the date\nYou're coming with me, your soul I'm next to take\nI told him \"I'm too much blessed with faith\"\n\"And living for Christ\" and then he said \"Manifest the great\"\nAll of a sudden, what I'm remembering\nGround started to shake, everything trembling\nThe power of the truth was shooting through my Timberlands\nHere was my Lord Jesus Christ, my best friend again, come on\n\nRepeat 1 While:\n\n[Puffy]\nYou mean everything to me\nYou've been with me from day one\nEven when I thought nobody was there\nYou were there\nYou're my best friend\nI love you like no other\nThere is no feeling like this in the world\nIf you can relate to what I'm feeling\nPut your hands in the air for me\nLet me see you\nNaw, matter of fact clap your hands for me\nClap your hands, come on\nThank you Jesus\nYou always hear me when I'm calling\nAlways catch me when I fall, yeah\nI surrender all to thee\nI want the whole world to see\nThat you've always been, you'll always be\nMy best friend\nI love you Jesus\nThank you, forgive me for my trespasses\nAs I forgive those who trespass against me\nThank you",

my side\nYou've always been my best friend\nYou're the love of my life (Oh)\nYou're everything to me (Oh)\nYou never left my side (You're my best friend)\nI love you so much (Yes, you are)\nYou're my best friend\n\n[Puffy]\nSince the beginning of time\nAll you did was bless men\nToo young to understand but now you my best friend\nHow could they doubt you, never think about you\nDon't they know nothing's possible without you\n\nFaith without fear that's how they raised me\nWords of man kill but never phase me\nGrateful for wisdom that you gave me\nBut still I'm like, dear God I wonder, could you save me?\nToo much sinning, gotta be more than plush living\nGotta be more than grabbing nines to buck tin in\nGotta be more than just to lust women\nGotta be more than platinum Rolexes, 600's and crushed linen\nPraise your name, I know some of them hate their due\nJudgment day, don't they know they can't escape your crew\nI'm just trying to live right and pray you take me through\nAnd with this song I dedicate to you, my Lord\n\n1 - [Mario Winans]\nLord, you mean the world to me\nBefore I was born you chose me\nYou always hear me when I'm calling\nEven catch me when I'm falling\nYou're the closest one to me\nI surrender all to thee\nI want the whole wide world to see\nThat we've always been and we'll always be\nBest friends\n\n[Puffy]\nSometimes I reminisce and wonder how I made it this far\nBecause of you, I'm me, so you the real star\nYour hindsight, the time's right to get my mind tight\nThen give it to you and let it shine bright\nMy best friend, only know how to teach the truth\nPlant the seeds of life and let them eat the fruit\nCan't you see that He spread love for you\nShed blood for you, cry for and die for you\nWillies with mac millies know how you get down\nWe know the drama you bring whenever you hit town\nJust remember when you pray, God is love\nGracious, merciful, forgive even the hardest thugs\nLife as we know it, it all begins with Him\nLife as we know it, it all ends with Him\nIf I was you I would never try to pretend with Him\nHe might spaz and blow it, I'm best friends with him\n\nRepeat 1\n\n[Puffy]\nBeen two and a half years since my man Big passed\nBeen two and a half years since my world crashed\nI needed help, God gave me the power\nGave me the strength to go face to face with my darkest hour\nLooked me in the eyes and ask \"What you doing unhappy?\"\n\"Don't you know why I'm here?\" and started shooting at me\nBack to the wall, is my faith gonna play out\nNever wavered once, gave me no way out\nYour time to die, don't even stress the date\nYou're coming with me, your soul I'm next to take\nI told him \"I'm too much blessed with faith\"\n\"And living for Christ\" and then he said \"Manifest the great\"\nAll of a sudden, what I'm remembering\nGround started to shake, everything trembling\nThe power of the truth was shooting through my Timberlands\nHere was my Lord Jesus Christ, my best friend again, come on\n\nRepeat 1 While:\n\n[Puffy]\nYou mean everything to me\nYou've been with me from day one\nEven when I thought nobody was there\nYou were there\nYou're my best friend\nI love you like no other\nThere is no feeling like this in the world\nIf you can relate to what I'm feeling\nPut your hands in the air for me\nLet me see you\nNaw, matter of fact clap your hands for me\nClap your hands, come on\nThank you Jesus\nYou always hear me when I'm calling\nAlways catch me when I fall, yeah\nI surrender all to thee\nI want the whole world to see\nThat you've always been, you'll always be\nMy best friend\nI love you Jesus\nThank you, forgive me for my trespasses\nAs I forgive those who trespass against me\nThank you"}}, {"title": "Satisfy You", "album": "Forever", "year": "1999-08-24", "lyrics": "[Puffy]\nAll

Kelly-Hook]\nHe don't understand you like I do\nNo he'll never make love to you like I do\nSo give it to me\nCause I can show you 'bout a real love\nAnd I can promise anything that I do\nIs just to satisfy you\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhen it hurt I ease the pain girl, caress your frame\nGet them worries off your brain girl, I'm in your corner\nDo what you want, it's your thing girl, I persist and try but\nWe one in the same girl, it ain't a game\nSo I can't play with you, I wanna lay with you\nStay with you, pray with you, grow old and gray with you\nIn good and bad times, we'll always make it through\nCause what we got is true, no matter what they say to you\nI could straight lace you, not just appearance\nStimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits\nBe that voice of reason when you ain't tryna hear it\nYou want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it\nSit her on the sofa, get a little closer\nTouch you right, do it like a man's suppose to\nKnew you was the one, that's why I chose you\nCause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nYour soul ain't a toy, you ain't dealin' with a boy\nFeel emptiness inside? I can fill that void\nWhen you spend time with your woman and listen\nIt shines more than any baguette diamond can glisten\nI can't impress you with the cars and the wealth\nCause any woman with will and drive can get it herself\nI'd rather show you it's heartfelt, make your heart melt\nAnd prove to you you're more important than anything else\nWorthwhile, special like my first child\nWhen I see your face it's always like the first time\nOur eyes met, I knew we'd be together in a tri-jet\nI wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet\nHold you, mold you, don't know, let me show you\nAin't no tellin' what we could grow to\nLet it be known, I told you\nAnd I'mma be there for whatever you go through, my love's true\n\n[Hook]\n\n[R.

Kelly-Hook]\nHe don't understand you like I do\nNo he'll never make love to you like I do\nSo give it to me\nCause I can show you 'bout a real love\nAnd I can promise anything that I do\nIs just to satisfy you\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhen it hurt I ease the pain girl, caress your frame\nGet them worries off your brain girl, I'm in your corner\nDo what you want, it's your thing girl, I persist and try but\nWe one in the same girl, it ain't a game\nSo I can't play with you, I wanna lay with you\nStay with you, pray with you, grow old and gray with you\nIn good and bad times, we'll always make it through\nCause what we got is true, no matter what they say to you\nI could straight lace you, not just appearance\nStimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits\nBe that voice of reason when you ain't tryna hear it\nYou want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it\nSit her on the sofa, get a little closer\nTouch you right, do it like a man's suppose to\nKnew you was the one, that's why I chose you\nCause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nYour soul ain't a toy, you ain't dealin' with a boy\nFeel emptiness inside? I can fill that void\nWhen you spend time with your woman and listen\nIt shines more than any baguette diamond can glisten\nI can't impress you with the cars and the wealth\nCause any woman with will and drive can get it herself\nI'd rather show you it's heartfelt, make your heart melt\nAnd prove to you you're more important than anything else\nWorthwhile, special like my first child\nWhen I see your face it's always like the first time\nOur eyes met, I knew we'd be together in a tri-jet\nI wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet\nHold you, mold you, don't know, let me show you\nAin't no tellin' what we could grow to\nLet it be known, I told you\nAnd I'mma be there for whatever you go through, my love's true\n\n[Hook]\n\n[R. Kelly-Bridge]\nDon't let him sing you a sad song (No baby)\nWaiting for love like this too long\n(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on him, baby)\nAll that you need I can give you\n(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on)\nI do, satisfy you\n(You don't have to wait on him)\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm the light when you can't see\nI'm that air when you can't breathe\nI'm that feeling when you can't leave\nSome doubt, some believe, some lie, cheat, and deceive\nSo it's only you and me\nWhen you weak, I'll make you strong, here's where you belong\nI ain't perfect, but I promise I won't do you wrong\nKeep you away from harm, my love is protected\nI'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected\nI'll just make you aware of what we have is rare\nIn the moment of despair, I'm the courage when you're scared\nLoyal, down for you, soon as I saw you\nWanted to be there cause I could hold it down for you\nBe around for you, plant seeds in the soil\nMake love all night, bending bed coils\nYou're a queen, therefore I treat you royal\nThis is all for you, cause I simply adore you\n\n[Hook] until fade\n\n[Puff]\nThis one right here goes out to all my sisters"}}, {"title": "Angels (Remix)", "album": null, "year": "2010-02-09", "lyrics": "[Rick Ross - Intro]\nBad Boy\nMaybach\nYou ain't even gotta count the money\nIt's all up\nBOSS\nAll aboard\nLast Train to Paris\nHeh, via the ghetto\n{Maybach Music!}\nUh...

ignorance\nBut I keep making the same mistakes before I\nI see the danger but I go forward\nI'm sitting here trying to keep my composure\nKnowing inside I'm broken and tore up\nShe got me gone, I'm on her like a drug\nI try to go but end up wanting more\nStuck in my head vivid as a picture\nI wanna be clean but I can't get rid of her\n\n[Verse 1: Diddy, Chris Brown & Both]\nUh, give my all, you take it from me (From me, girl)\nAnd don't even replace it for me (No)\nI wish you'd just fake it for me (Fake it)\nI wish I can make you love me more\nYou can't tell I fucks with you\nI needed you\nI thought that you understood that\nBased on how I treated you\nI don't pay attention to the rumors that you feed into\nKnow you're missin' somethin'\nI wish I was what completed you (Damn, da-da, damn,

like a killer hit me (Hit me)\nThe weapon was concealed initially (Oh, oh)\nBut I felt so much pain from it (Pain)\nYou deserved to feel it with me more\nI feel like I beg with you, I plead with you\nI don't comprehend how you can't love\nWhen it's so easy to\nI thought you could do it\nI believed in the naive in you (Oh, oh)\nI just need to breathe, baby (Oh, no)\nNow I got the freedom to\n\n[Outro: Chris Brown]\nShe's like a drug, yeah\nAnd I don't think I can get rid of her (I can't get rid of her)\n'Cause she got me in this curse (Yeah)\nAnd then it dawned on me\nI can't do nothing with her\nThis woman's worth (Yeah, no, oh)\nI can't find my way out and it hurts\nI tried but she won't let me go\nShe won't let me go\nShe won\u2019t let me go\nShe won't let me go, oh\nShe

ring\nCarats ain't nothin' when the cabbage ain't nothin'\nI got habits like goin' to Paris I ain't frontin'\nYou can never need for nothin', only one pipe\nWould you like to go to dinner, wit Jordan and his wife?\nAm I moving fast? It could happen real soon\nThousand dollar shoes, dance in ballrooms\nYou know the dress, that got the party impressed\nYou'll only wear it one time, cause the world is mine\nI try to address it, but you never get the message\nYou the water in my life and I'm trapped in the desert\nI never seen a honey sweeter, won't stop\nTill I get her cause I need her, my se\u00f1orita\n\n[Chorus: Puff Daddy]\nMami ven aqui\nI wanna be your papi chulo can't you see?

Hold me down!!!\n\n[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]\nMonster cut truck balley shit\nChampagne spillin while we hittin every bump that my Denali hit\nOutfit is four thousand and better\nThe rhinestones in my flintstones look crazy in my sweater\nPah, it's not a big fairy tale that's my M.O\nFuck bitches on the rag with no problemo\nIceberg, rabbits, in the Foxhills Mall\nWhere I copped two more, brought four for RZA\nBad Boy thank you for this special delivery\nCatch me by the pool in my Tony Starks slippers\nWonder Woman armed, Ghost is intelligent\nMade 30 off of dust dime I was killin 'em\nDid cash on One-Sixteen I was feelin 'em\nThem days kept a crisp coke dollar bill on 'em\nI lived it out -- special delivery\nI spit it out -- special delivery\nI sniffed it out -- special delivery\n\n[Hook: P.

ones who stand firm like ain't, nuttin shook\nAbout them, I doubt them cats waitin for me\nYou know them niggas, them big dudes across the street\nShe say, \"Yeah, they from over on Mayfair\"\nBullets from out of nowhere, told her to stay there and duck down\nI hit the ground but managed to pull a piece out\nThis bitch over there with them pointin the chief out\nThey want beef out here, they gon' get it\nIn the worst way, I'mma show em how Black play\nRoll the dice, fuckin with me is like snake eyes\nI break guys, sit back and watch my cake rise\nIt's all about the Benjamins, true that be the motto\nRan out of ammo and started, throwin bottles\nRunnin, and I ain't lookin back for shit\nCrooked ass bitch, today I get you back for this\n(I'll get you back)\n\n[Chorus: repeat 2X]\nI love you baby No you don't\nYou drive me crazy That's right\nI'll never betray thee Uhh\nI love you baby C'mon\n\n[Verse 2: Black Rob]\nYo since the last altercation I been on the street\nSeein honey at the club every week and not speak\nI'mma rock that ass to sleep before I strike\nI ain't know the real deal until last night\nHow, one of them brothers was locked with Babe Bro\nUsed to call my crib from C-Seventy-Four\nKick rhymes over the phone for hours he had the jack\nBabe bro told him, 'You wanna get money, see Black\nWhen you get home', we never had chance to get up\nAnd wouldn't have, if his gun had left me hit up\nHe'd explain how his whole crew was slappin honey\nBesides all that, she owed them cats a lot of money\nFunny how it's a small world, baby girl\nYouse about to get fucked with no gel\nI'mma sit back and watch this cake finish bakin\nAnd plan your extermination, word\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3: Puff Dady]\nIt took a while to peep your style, Miss I-B-M-workin\nLow profile single, house in Staten Island\nAnd Manhattan while, them same cats\nYou sent to get me boo, is on they to get you\nFuckin' witchu, that small time crack dealin' nigga\nHe a bitch too, they gon' bust his shit too\nShit's real, you think you gonna set me up\nAnd get away scot free without some type of injury\nNah kill it, I'mma flip the script on you\nSame thing you did to me, I'mma do it to you\nWho knew she was the female Rambo\nFill one of they chest with four soon as he came in the door\nLife is out, snuffed all they mans and\nIn the end, she had to be the Last Bitch Standin'\nNot for long the buck the forty-four strong\nJust like that she was gone, now it's over\nAssumin' I'll go back to my everyday life\nOf a rich millionaire just rockin' the mic\nGotta pause, and think about honey no doubt\nAnd admire how the chick went out\n\n[Chorus]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a6984ae0fa0cdf55d0d316087289f892.220x221x1.jpg", "artist": "Puff Daddy", "raw": {"annotation_count":

Black Rob]\nI met her Uptown on Dyckman, aight then\nTalkin that, how she only dealt with businessmen\nNiggas baggin joints, money off and on the books\nThe ones who stand firm like ain't, nuttin shook\nAbout them, I doubt them cats waitin for me\nYou know them niggas, them big dudes across the street\nShe say, \"Yeah, they from over on Mayfair\"\nBullets from out of nowhere, told her to stay there and duck down\nI hit the ground but managed to pull a piece out\nThis bitch over there with them pointin the chief out\nThey want beef out here, they gon' get it\nIn the worst way, I'mma show em how Black play\nRoll the dice, fuckin with me is like snake eyes\nI break guys, sit back and watch my cake rise\nIt's all about the Benjamins, true that be the motto\nRan out of ammo and started, throwin bottles\nRunnin, and I ain't lookin back for shit\nCrooked ass bitch, today I get you back for this\n(I'll get you back)\n\n[Chorus: repeat 2X]\nI love you baby No you don't\nYou drive me crazy That's right\nI'll never betray thee Uhh\nI love you baby C'mon\n\n[Verse 2: Black Rob]\nYo since the last altercation I been on the street\nSeein honey at the club every week and not speak\nI'mma rock that ass to sleep before I strike\nI ain't know the real deal until last night\nHow, one of them brothers was locked with Babe Bro\nUsed to call my crib from C-Seventy-Four\nKick rhymes over the phone for hours he had the jack\nBabe bro told him, 'You wanna get money, see Black\nWhen you get home', we never had chance to get up\nAnd wouldn't have, if his gun had left me hit up\nHe'd explain how his whole crew was slappin honey\nBesides all that, she owed them cats a lot of money\nFunny how it's a small world, baby girl\nYouse about to get fucked with no gel\nI'mma sit back and watch this cake finish bakin\nAnd plan your extermination, word\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3: Puff Dady]\nIt took a while to peep your style, Miss I-B-M-workin\nLow profile single, house in Staten Island\nAnd Manhattan while, them same cats\nYou sent to get me boo, is on they to get you\nFuckin' witchu, that small time crack dealin' nigga\nHe a bitch too, they gon' bust his shit too\nShit's real, you think you gonna set me up\nAnd get away scot free without some type of injury\nNah kill it, I'mma flip the script on you\nSame thing you did to me, I'mma do it to you\nWho knew she was the female Rambo\nFill one of they chest with four soon as he came in the door\nLife is out, snuffed all they mans and\nIn the end, she had to be the Last Bitch Standin'\nNot for long the buck the forty-four strong\nJust like that she was gone, now it's over\nAssumin' I'll go back to my everyday life\nOf a rich millionaire just rockin' the mic\nGotta pause, and think about honey no doubt\nAnd admire how the chick went out\n\n[Chorus]"}}, {"title": "Tell Me", "album": "Press Play", "year": "2006-10-17", "lyrics": "[Intro: Diddy]\nCan you feel me\nDo that shit, do that shit, do it (x 4)\nGet

second\nYou don't know who I am\nAnd what I do, lets just put it do the side\nI can feel your heart beating\nI can hear you breathing\nLook into your eyes, try to see into your mind\nSee into your soul\nSee no limits, to the levels me and you can go\nWhen it's me that is in control\nBut it's something 'bout you that make me wanna change\nI like the way you dance and the way you play the game\nI

lanes\nI don't want your innocence\nI don't want you to stutter\nI don't want a commitment\nAnd I don't want you to suffer\nI don't want your number\nBaby I want you to wonder\nWant you to come up

test\nYou're pulsating, ya heart is beating out of your chest\nYou're hyperventilating, tryin to catch your breath (Don't stop)\nI'm the first I'm the next I'm the end\nI'm the pulse and of course I'll make ya my thing (Oh!)\nLook how I approach you, look how I expose you\nLook how I've studied every move, now I know you\nI don't wanna control you, I wanna console you\nAnd do everything that I

marijuana, pussy\nSome things I don't go without\nCome to my house, probably get lost\nHave you stuffing weed in cones you won't make it out\nI be so high that I'm floating\nFucked this bitch and now she open\nTalking 'bout she want a real one\nAll these niggas, I don't feel none\nHundred thousand dollar bills on her\nWrote another thousand dollar meal\nI'm the king and all my niggas loyal still\nTake your bitch and fuck her, crazy for the thrill\nI ain't tripping on you niggas cause I'm making paper\nLaugh now, she gon' fuck me later\nSmell the KK from the elevator\nNo phones, they

came here with nothing, you leave here with nothing\nYou know what I'm talking 'bout, you know what I'm talking 'bout\n\n[Verse 1: French Montana]\nShe came here with nothing, she gon' leave with nothing\nI was born with nothing, gon' die with nothing\nMy dome is strapped and she'll die for nothing\nYou came here for them, came out with nothing\nMy whole team stunting, neck full of gold, haaan\nI'm high and drunk, don't listen to this\nNo OG or Puff, got Christian women\nShe came from the block, it was picture women\nHop on this yacht, come fishing with me\nAll these bad bitches taking pictures with me\nAll the police taking pictures of me\nNew Lambo, old pistol with me\nGot bando out the window of it\n\n[Hook]\nI want it all or nothing, don't give me nothing\nDon't give me

nothing\nYou know what I'm talking 'bout, you know what I'm talking 'bout\n\n[Verse 2]\nI want it all\nYou want it too but shit, I want it more\nI had a ball\nI spoke to Ye, he said \"I am a god\"\nGot no time though\nYou know what I'm talking 'bout?\nYou can't take it with you, you might as well ball\nYou know what I'm talking 'bout?\nI take from the rich and I give to the poor\nI want it all or nothing, don't give me nothing\nI was born with nothing, gon' die with nothing\nThey ain't give me nothing so I owe 'em nothing\n\n[Hook]\nI want it all or nothing, don't give me nothing\nDon't give me nothing\nAyo French, yo, talk to 'em\nI want it all or nothing, these niggas be fronting\nThese niggas be fronting\nYou know what I'm talking 'bout\nYou came here with nothing, you leave here with nothing\nYou know what I'm talking 'bout, you know what I'm talking 'bout\n\n[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]\nI want all the weed, I want all the cheese\nI want a bad bitch from overseas\nI need my dick sucked, I mean, on your knees\nI roll a paper plane, go where I'm supposed to be\nI'm probably in the clouds and I ain't looking down\nNo problems, I got all smiles\nThe niggas with me, they all wild\nCounting money, let it all pile\nThey've been waiting a long while\nFor a young nigga with his own style\nShe hit my phone and I go to her house\nGive me that brain, told her open her mouth\nKnow when I'm 'bout, money, marijuana, pussy\nSome things I don't go without\nCome to my house, probably get lost\nHave you stuffing weed in cones you won't make it out\nI be so high that I'm

love\nGot me fiendin' right now, girl, I need you right now\nTryna hold back but you can get it\nDon't tease me right now, baby, please me right now\nGirl, scream yes if you with it\n\n[Hook: Trey Songz]\nGot, got-got, got-got one question, one question for you\nWhen I'm goin' through withdrawals tell me what I'm 'sposed to do\n'Cause I need your love, I want your love\nGirl, it ain't the same if I ain't got your love\nYour love, your love, your love, your love\nAll I want is you baby, all I want is you baby\nAll I really want is you, your touch, your sex is my drug\nAll I want is you babe, only one is you baby\n\n[Verse 3: Dirty Money]\nI'ma put it in yo' face boy as soon as you wake up\nI know you wanna hit it, want me to be your little slut\nIf you do it good, boy I'll return the favor\nBaby, I'm tired of the bed I wanna try it on the table\nBoy, I fiendin' right now, boy, I need you right now\nCome a-come a, come a little closer you can get it\nDon't tease me right now, better please me right now\nLet your tongue walk on this pussy\n\n[Hook: Dirty Money & Trey Songz]\nGot, got-got, got-got one question, one question for you\nWhen I'm goin' through withdrawals tell me what I'm 'sposed to do\n'Cause I need your love, I want your love\nBoy, it ain't the same if I ain't got your love\nYour love, your love, your love, your love\nAll I want is you baby, all I want is you baby\nAll I really want is you, your touch, your sex is my drug\nAll I want is you babe, only one is you baby\n\n[Verse 4: Diddy]\nBitch you know I'm Diddy hoe, real deally-o\nReal estate in the states, spillin' in Philly yo\nI did it for the team, I did it for you shorty\nI did it for the fam, I did it for the glory\nCocky nigga still half cockin' my Yankee fitted\nMy wrists Rocky, Sylvester Stallone, Jacob did it\nEarly birds, furry furs\nHis and hers, baby girl, silver spurs\nYou know I stay on my grind and she be right there\nThe shit I'm doin' won't be seen or done for light years\nTalkin' me and you, the world is ours\nAll we need is our love, money, and the power\nTalk to 'em\n\n[Outro: Dirty Money & Trey Songz]\nMy love, my love, your love, your love)\nYour sex, your sex, is my drug, is my drug\nBoy I need your body here tonight\nI ain't leavin' this club without your love\nYour love, your love, your love, your love\nAll I really want is your love\nOh, oh\nLove, yeah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fda63e3c57b2b428117325d3a72b23b9.760x752x1.jpg", "artist": "Puff Daddy", "raw": {"annotation_count": 7, "api_path": "/songs/53763", "apple_music_id": null,

what an Audmer is\nWalk up in the spot and we the trillest niggas in here\nGrab her by her arms, suck her neck 'til she surrenderin\u2019\nIs it him? Valet the BM\nNot a baller, but ballin' above the rim\nStill blowin' money fast, Boston George, countin' money\nChick finer than Wylona, so I let her count it for me\nShe got a nice bubble when she rockin' Robin jeans\nSmokin' all the loud, but the neighbors can hear us scream\nBlew a milli in a club, next day we made five\nSmokin' on a jet, they bill your card with the fine\nNever mind, Dirty Money ballin' on another planet\nIf I bought another Coupe, you niggas couldn't stand it\nMC Hammer in the flesh, 357\nBaby girl a thug, she use her pussy as a weapon\n\n[Verse 2: Trey Songz]\nGirl, I want you face down first thing when I wake up\nAlready got you covered girl ain't no need for make-up\nI just need a camera and someone to tape us\nInternet ain't ready for the way that we gon' make love\nGot me fiendin' right now, girl, I need you right now\nTryna hold back but you can get it\nDon't tease me right now, baby, please me right now\nGirl, scream yes if you with it\n\n[Hook: Trey Songz]\nGot, got-got, got-got one question, one question for you\nWhen I'm goin' through withdrawals tell me what I'm 'sposed to do\n'Cause I need your love, I want your love\nGirl, it ain't the same if I ain't got your love\nYour love, your love, your love, your love\nAll I want is you baby, all I want is you baby\nAll I really want is you, your touch, your sex is my drug\nAll I want is you babe, only one is you baby\n\n[Verse 3: Dirty Money]\nI'ma put it in yo' face boy as soon as you wake up\nI know you wanna hit it, want me to be your little slut\nIf you do it good, boy I'll return the favor\nBaby, I'm tired of the bed I wanna try it on the table\nBoy, I fiendin' right now, boy, I need you right now\nCome a-come a, come a little closer you can get it\nDon't tease me right now, better please me right now\nLet your tongue walk on this pussy\n\n[Hook: Dirty Money & Trey Songz]\nGot, got-got, got-got one question, one question for you\nWhen I'm goin' through withdrawals tell me what I'm 'sposed to do\n'Cause I need your love, I want your love\nBoy, it ain't the same if I ain't got your love\nYour love, your love, your love, your love\nAll I want is you baby, all I want is you baby\nAll I really want is you, your touch, your sex is my drug\nAll I want is you babe, only one is you baby\n\n[Verse 4: Diddy]\nBitch you know I'm Diddy hoe, real deally-o\nReal estate in the states, spillin' in Philly yo\nI did it for the team, I did it for you shorty\nI did it for the fam, I did it for the glory\nCocky nigga still half cockin' my Yankee fitted\nMy wrists Rocky, Sylvester Stallone, Jacob did it\nEarly birds, furry furs\nHis and hers, baby girl, silver spurs\nYou know I stay on my grind and she be right there\nThe shit I'm doin' won't be seen or done for light years\nTalkin' me and you, the world is ours\nAll we need is our love, money, and the power\nTalk to 'em\n\n[Outro: Dirty Money & Trey Songz]\nMy love, my love, your love, your love)\nYour sex, your sex, is my drug, is my drug\nBoy I need your body here tonight\nI ain't leavin' this club without your love\nYour love, your love, your love, your love\nAll I really want is your love\nOh, oh\nLove, yeah"}}, {"title": "Ass On The Floor", "album": "Last Train to Paris", "year": "2010-12-14", "lyrics": "[Refrain: Swizz Beatz]\nWhen you\u2019re in the club, get your ass on the floor\nWhen

Lil Wayne]\nUhh, before you get here\nPut your panties in your pocketbook\nThat\u2019s what I told her over the Motorola\nHennessy and Cola\nI hold her at attention with my manners\nAnd even though I don\u2019t roll a camera\nShe still performs like the superstar she truly are\nSo, also, I think I love her already\nDamn, I think I, already, ha-heh\nShe must be the one\nI look in her eyes and see the sun even on rainy days\nAin't it crazy mane? Yeah, that\u2019s what I said\nShe do doughnuts in my head, over and over and over\nTil the cops pull her over\nAnd then she say some real slick shit like\n\u201cI\u2019m on my way by Weezy Baby\u201d\nHeh, and of course they let her go\n(Let me take off my shades)\n\n[Verse 1: Bilal & (Diddy)]\nI know I got a lot of baggage\nIt's full of ladies and Mercedes\nYou say \"I know that it\u2019s heavy\"\nBut I'll pay someone to grab it, for me, yeah\nI know I got a lot of baggage\nFull of Chanel\u2019s and Tiffany\u2019s and broken hearts girl\nYou need me baby\nIt's hard to break a habit, for me, yeah\nAnd girl if you want (what do you want me to do?)\nI pour a gallon of gasoline on my heart just to light your cigarette\nGirl if you want (I\u2019ll do anything for you)\nI\u2019ll do anything for you (I\u2019ll even take off my shades)\nI\u2019ll even take off my shades\nAnd stare right at the sun from the stage\n(I\u2019ll even try different things) I\u2019ll even try different things\nI\u2019ll make love to you on marmalade\n(Never made love on marmalade)\nI\u2019ll even change my name, name, what you say\n(I\u2019ll be what ever you say) I\u2019ll be what ever you say\nI\u2019ll even take off my shades\nI\u2019ll make love to you on marmalade\n(Are you sure that's what you want to do)\nIf that's what you want to do\n\n[Hook x2: Bilal & James Fauntleroy]\nWhat you gonna do?

Listen to me)\nI know I got a lot of baggage\nIt's full of promises that why I keep a lock on it\nI promise girl I\u2019m trying to make it happen, for me, and you babe\nNow girl if you wanna pour a gallon of gasoline on my heart\nAnd light it if you get lonely\nIf you call me, girl if you call me\nIf you want me I\u2019m ready when you are just tell me you want me\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Justin Timberlake]\nBlack, gray, white\nIf I pull down these shades would I sound too bright\nGet it, sound too right\nMaybe I\u2019m just feeling myself cause\nFlashing lights come from everywhere\nAnd you can feel that something's blowing in the air tonight\nNow if you need that fire I\u2019ll be that propane\nIf you need it wet I can make it pour rain\nBut maybe I won't, maybe you just have to take it\nGo ahead pretend I\u2019m a drug now let me see you shake it\nI can read your mind, read your mind, Professor X\nWe can press rewind, press rewind, VHS\nSpeaking of the past, its so futuristic behind ya\nLet me fill up that plate and dish it out, dish it out, China\nI\u2019mma bend yo body, bend yo body, Magneto\nLet me have my way, I\u2019mma have my way, Carlito\nNow we can put in work, let me get my busy on for you\nYou ain't never heard me talk like this, just got my Drizzy on for you\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/eb1fc48a136a9ccd12db01d345a9d8a2.1000x1000x1.jpg",

end?)\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse One: Puff Daddy]\nSometimes I be wakin up at high noon\nSayin, \"Why me Lord?\" -- folks thinkin I'mma die soon\nI just tell em keep seekin, but when they sleepin\nI be concealed up in my room, knowin that it could happen\nI'm just tryin to maintin, because the future is untold\nTill the static unfolds that the good die young\nPlease God let a Bad Boy die old\nDo you think I wanna lie cold\nOr better yet have many shots come close to the head\nShirt soaked til it's red\nThe most that was said was that my homies had a toast to the dead\nDo I need a pack a vest for stress so I can rest\nCause even though I'm blessed in my flesh\nIt all came down to a test\nA motherfucker wanna go and put a tattoo on my chest\nNow I'm caught up in the mix and I can't do shit, but still\nI can't ride with program, fearing no man\nHit the car door let the door slam it's a blessing that he had slow hands\nBut he's still right behind me\nAll these heartless fools is steady comin after my P\nSo many phony niggas lovin to hate Sean\nSo many cheddar niggas comin after my cheese\nIs it my car that they're losin, are we all for the choosin?\nOr is it all in confusion? Better yet all an illusion\nShots rang through the hall bullets cruisin for bruisin\nDon't let this heartless bastard take my life away\nI don't wanna conceive takin his either\nDipped into the back and took a breather\nHeard steps steady in closin with the bullet skeezer\nGotta do somethin, I ain't scared to go\nBut yet my heart is steady pumpin for somethin\nI refuse to be the one that they be dumpin\nGotta get away before the techs start gunnin\nBodies start jumpin, wreckin my brain not to try and understand\nBut withstand, is it cause I'm a rich man\nOr is it trying to put a brother down in the dirt like quicksand\nBut no matter what the reason, I don't wanna stop breathin\nThere's dreams to fulfill still\nCan't complete em with a still kill\nFace to face with enemies still grill\nForgive me for the pain I've caused and the sins I've committed\nEven though I'm not hopin to go\nI wish someone would open the do'\nThis man's holding the trigger and his finger's steady choking it slow\nIs this the end?\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Hook Two: Ginuwine]\nJust, can't, let, go (Is this the end?)\nI, just, don't, know\nWish it would've happened then\n\n[Verse Two: Puff Daddy, Twista]\nDid I just hear a tight jam, now it's on let make my maneuver\nHit the alley saw his man in a landcruiser\nIn his hand was a Ruger, dipped in a Lex like Luger\nHeard shots from a steel bruiser\nTeflon in the seat took a pale stress\nFelt the hate on my chest as I placed on my vest\nWhat's wrong with the brakes in the LX?\nRan straight into a lightpole, just before I got my life stole\nA car came to the rescue\nI bailed in and said, \"Bless you\nBut what made me the man you would wanna show help to?\"\nI proceeded to ask him, and he said with a passion\n\nI could never watch a soul die, plus you the man lookin too fly\n(But who are you?) The pimp nigga named Twista from the cold Chi\nAin't no sunshine, gotta keep [?] nigga, I been shot at and stole on\nNo protection from one time, only caught for my prime\nSo I asked the Father what I did so wrong?\nCause shit it's been hard for me besides chief\nAnd the smell of sweet news when the beef brew\nMotherfuckers steady ballin but steady fallin\nRight in detours, bout to hit my feet soon\nSo I just presume, deep into the rhymes of a rapper\nPrepare my mind for the capture\nThinkin Ginuwine like the bachelor\nBut why these niggas wanna make us intertwined with the rapture?\nEgo for dispersin us, don't even hurt the clutch\nCause he's coldblooded and merciless\nSteady bustin shots at both of us, was the strap close to us\nThen for survival we both to bust\nBut Renaults get to roast to crush, cause he steady gettin closer\nParanoid like a crackfiend when the gat seen\nScream when the bullet hit me in the shoulder\nDon't wanna die til I get older\nTry to visualize the beholder, he's inconceivable\nSo now my sight is gettin dark a lot\nLet's step off up in this parking lot where them dogs bark a lot\nAnd try to wait until his ma get hot\nI can make a person fight to survive whether good or connivin\nYou never know when it's your time to leave\nSmokin weed to keep my mind at ease, let's go back to the car\nBut wait, I can't find the keys\nPlus we didn't chill long enough, the footsteps are comin close\nIs it one of them unholy men?\nWith a strap ready to boldly sin\nMama told me it was comin, but I wish she woulda told me when\nIs this the end?\n\n[Hook 2X]\n\n(Chorus Two fades out at the end)"}}, {"title": "Come With Me", "album": "Godzilla: The Album", "year": null, "lyrics": "Uh-huh, Yeah\nUh-huh, Yeah, uuh\nUh-huh, Yeah, uuh\nUh-huh, Yeah, uuh\nUh-huh, Yeah, uuh\nUh-huh, Yeah, Yeah\n\nHear my cries\nHear my call\nLend me your ears\nSee my fall\nSee my error\nKnow my faults\nTime halts\nSee my loss\nKnow I'm lacking\nBacktracking\nWhere I met you\nPistol packing\nItchy finger\nTrigger happy\nTry to trap me\nBad rap\nWiretap me\nBack-stab me\nBreak the faith\nFall from grace\nTell me lies\nTime flies\nClose your eyes\n\nCome with me\nCome with me, Yeah\nCome with me, Uh-huh, Yeah\n\nYou said to trust you\nYou'd never hurt me\nNow I'm disgusted\nSince then adjusted\nCertainly you fooled me\nRidiculed me\nLeft me hanging\nNow shit is boomeranging\nRight back at you\nThink long range\nNarrow-minded\nLeft me blinded\nI cosigned it\nShit backfired\nBut I'm bouncing back\nI grinded\nNot many would bear the pressure\nYou comprehend me\nYou want to end me\nYou offend me\nIt's drama, feel the trauma\nCome with me\n\nYeah, Uh-huh, ah ha\nCome with me, Don't be afraid, yeah\nCome with me\n\nI close my eyes\nAnd I see..\nYou standing there\nI cry...\nTears...\nOf sorrow...\nI die....\n\nUh-huh, Yeah\n\nFuck my enemies\nFuck my foes\nDamn these hoes\nYou're stepping on my toes\nBack up off me\nTake your hands off me\nGive me room to breathe\nI'm not hearing it\nI'm not fearing it\nI'm up to my ears in it\nBullshit I'm destructive\nSome women find that seductive\nSome say it's lunacy\nReluctantly I've been moving on\nI ignore you\nSorry if I bore you\nI neglect you\nDon't mean to disrespect you\nCan't you see\nI love you dearly\nAnd that sincerely\nBut you annoy me\nYou can't avoid me\nI'm here to stay\nForever and ever and a day\nThat's never\nI can't let you go\nI can't forget it\nWhy you did it\nI won't permit it\nAnd won't acquit it\nI want to fight you\nI'll fucking bite you\nCan't stand nobody like you\nYou can't run\nYou can't hide\nNo surprise\nClose your eyes\n\nCome with me, yeah\nCome with me\nCome with me, AHHHHHHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOWWW\nYeah, like this\nCome on, Come on\nYeah turn me up, turn me up\nYeah yeah yeah, come on now, Yeah\n\nHear my cries\nHear my calls\nLend me your ears (Uh huh You ready now?

Rottweilers\nPull the collars, make em sit for the Godfather\nThen I holler, to Justin my son, run the water\nFor the shower, trust fund scholarship sure to give him power\nBaby momma call, she pick him up, in about an hour\nNow free to go, free to blow, with the calicos\nAnd the navajos, it's just the way this player knows\nAnything goes, finally caught up with my nigga Sam Sam\nPicked me up, in the tan Lex Land\nWanted breakfast down at Pan Pan's, what's your favorite dish?\nHe ordered cheese eggs and grits, I had the swordfish\nWhat is this? Three niggas dressed in black\nRoleys on they wrist, feathers in they hat\nOne tapped me on my back, then pointed at my stack\nPut my finger on the trigger\nThen I asked him, \"Whatchu want nigga?\"\n\n[Hook 2X: Puff Daddy]\nWhatchu gonna do when it's your turn to go\nWhatchu gonna do when you can't take no mo'\nYou gonna cry like a bitch or take it nice and slow\nWhatchu gonna do when it's your turn to go\n\n[Verse Two: Puff Daddy]\nI pray to God that I'm dreamin, I know my family\nWouldn't take it, when the doctor said, \"He ain't make it\"\nMom Dukes cryin, baby mom full of grief\nHow she gonna tell her son his daddy is deceased?\nNow she got beef with them bitches up the street\nAll because I used to creep, with her girlfriend Sharese\nShe knows, I keep the hoes, from nation, to nation\nOn every radio station, Goodfellas in rotation, uhh\nThat's why niggas wanna twist my shit, flip my wig\nAttempt to murder me like Tommy Gibbs\nBefore they draw, niggas threw me to the floor\nDrill holes in my pocket, Sam launch the rocket\nThey wanna rip my arms out the socket, fuckin heathens\nLove to see a nigga stop breathin\nI heard a voice sing out, \"Ain't you Sean Puffy Combs?\nHere's your eulogy, meet you at the Crossroads\"\nG'night Bone\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse Three: Puff Daddy]\nNothing but clouds and white suits fill my vision\nWatching my life go down, like Christion\nListen hear them bullets rang, shotguns and Mac millis\nSpraying like a hurricane in this war called the terror game\nAnd deuce deuces can't stand the pain\nLittle guns ain't got no business in this blizzard\nThey just kibitz, here's five shots to visit, blaka\nBlowin bullet holes sizes of door knockers\nThree headed for my chest straight, the other two\nCame a little late, and just barely missed my face\nI'm tryin to find a steady place between two cars\nOne of us gon' either wind up dead, or behind bars\nShit, I'm just tryin to live, so I can raise my kid\nAnd own the world, bone all the girlie girls\nThat's when I finally figured out\nThat's that nigga David Arthur, Sharese baby father\nAnd I didn't even bother to ask no further questions\nNo more confessions only suggestions\nI think Sam set me up, cause them bullets squeezed up\nFrom the rear, and Sam was the only nigga there\nThen they all peeled out in the rental, aluminum\nSam in the passenger seat, so I'm assumin them\nNiggas didn't even get to peep\nLil' Kim and them, in the backseat, with the heat\nClips they feelin em, to the top, shit ain't sweet\nOnce the light turns red, nuff said, that's dead\nThey fled, and they waved, hot lead\nIf I aimed up, I'd be on my deathbed\nSucker move, for that they don't get no props\nLil' Kim and them, mad they ain't bust no shots\nWe in the block, no Land posters just old posters\nOf gangsta niggas I see ghosts of gangsta figures\nI'm tryin to hold my own when they snatched me out the car\nTook me in the saloon and said, \"Puffy, there you are\"\nThem same cats we chased two blocks had new spots\nWashin dishes, I guess for goin out like bitches\nI smacked em, gave a little speech, to mirth\nHappiness, cause me and all my peeps got hurt\nThat night, I said a little prayer, me and Justin\nThat's when I heard the bustin, yeah\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "I Know", "album": "Last Train to Paris", "year": "2010-12-14", "lyrics": "[Intro:

in this madness, all alone on my mattress\nDon't know how the hell did this happen, you knew lovin' me was a hazard\nOutcome of my actions, I wish we could go backwards, go back a couple of chapters\nBack when there was laughter, back when we first met\nBefore we came such a disaster\nBefore your heart got shattered, before I forgot how much you mattered\nCrazy we don't realize what we have until after we no longer have it\nUh-uh, uh, uh, uh-uh\n\n[Chorus: Chris Brown, Sevyn Streeter, Both, (Diddy) & Wiz Khalifa]\nDon't you ever leave, don't you ever go away\n(Don't leave)\nDon't

out the door (Yeah), you're out the door\nYou sick and tired can't take no more (Come on), can't take no more\nYou know the game and tried to play it time and time before\nTold me you don't got time to waste, so hey, you got to go, you got to go (You got to go)\nCan't help of think of you when I'm alone (Come on)\nTried and failed, I call your cell, you don't pick up your phone\nGuess that really means you meant just what you said\nSaid just what you meant\nGettin' all this bread but it don't mean shit\nFuck the dough I get, plus the dough I spend, darling, just (Yeah)\n\n[Chorus: Chris Brown, Sevyn Streeter, Both, (Diddy) & Wiz Khalifa]\nDon't you ever leave, don't you ever go away, oh(Hahahaha)\n(Don't leave, baby) (Yeah)\nAnd throw it away, hear all them people talkin' 'bout us\nI love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, yeah\nYeah, them hoes so in the way\nBut this is all I can say\n(I love you)\nI'm begging you, don't you leave (Hahahaha)\nI'm begging you, baby (Uh)\nI'm

(I didn't survive)\nEast vs. West the rap game where words became flesh\nA whole pound of herb won't desolve my stress\nStill I ride to the death, love hip hop\nCause Afrikabababa was def, a lot of respect\nFeel Me? Fuck to the rock Sean John jury\nI got the same hands of crap platinum and the crap pyramids\nWrite about the black experience, sell it to Marimax\nTell me if you feelin' that\n\n[Chorus: Lil' Kim & Joe Hooker]\nTake a journey through the life of these real niggas\nThe things that they seen it would thrill niggas\nIf you've seen what they've seen, you would wonder\nThrough the rain and the pain and the thunder\nBy the time that you realized that it's goin' down\nYou may find yourself going underground\nWhen they see that this life is upon us\nWe would see that there's no one that we can trust\n\n[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]\nYou can never see what I see, motherfucker\nBeanie Sigel, the realest nigga from the streets was taught\nStay cased up nigga, stay deep in court\nReminiscin' on that cold cell, deep in thought\nGettin' skinny, couldn't eat, cause the meat was poor\nYa'll niggas couldn't live my life, I've been through it\nStreached up in hospital beds, fed fluid\nTwo bullets hit my leg, one passed through it\nSaw the blood and the hole in my calf, looked through it\nMy life's no joke, I don' played dice with soap\nUpstate the case niggas slice your throat\nWear your boxers in the shower when you guard your soap\nI done seen the biggest niggas in the yard get broke\nI done took blocks to war, took blocks for fall\nTook blocks to Wall for blocks of raw\nWhat you think .33 in the Glock is for?\nBlack fatigues, skullies and binoculars\nC4, block your doors, niggas can't stop this war\nI show you faggots what this Swatz' is for\nHidding spots in the door for the Glocks is for\nRead the papers, '94 I took the cops to war\nHalf of ya'll niggas livin' a lie\nOnly reason why you switchin' up your jewelry?\nCause you keep gettin' robbed\nI looked that nigga in the eyes before I send him to God\nBeanie Sigel, Desert Eagle, realest nigga alive\n\n[Chorus: Lil' Kim & Joe Hooker]\nTake a journey through the life of these real niggas\nThe things that they seen it would thrill niggas\nIf you've seen what they've seen, you would wonder\nThrough the rain and the pain and the thunder\nBy the time that you realized that it's goin' down\nYou may find yourself going underground\nWhen they see that this life is upon us\nWe would see that there's no one that we can trust\n\n[Verse 3: Nas]\nAyo, ayo, gangsta, gangsta\nThe Bible has words that Christ wrote, evil men sacrifice goats\nI speak all my life under oath\nSince a kid, troublesome\nThrowin' shit at little girls jump ropes\nBustin' BB guns at stray cats, that was way back\nWatched it die, covered in flies\nThen I picked up a stick, try to dig in its eyes\nMakin' dirt pies, na, being buggy-eyed shit\nAnd every other nigga that rap, sound like my shit\nI wear chrome .45's with ice on the grip\nI don't shoot it, I roll with killers and criminals\nWith heroin habits they picked up from the penile\nThey let you have it, all I do is give them a smile\nLifestyle of the realest, you ain't ruthless you bitch\nI got a pine box just your size, I know it fit\nYour whole life's a mistake, stop holdin' the pen\nKill yourself, come back as a man over again\nCause in this lifetime I'm reigning, slay men\nLeave your whole body cold\nYour nails grow long, you get gray skin\nMay this nigga rest in peace, Amen\nI run with brave men, straight out the housin', we wildin'\nNames engraved in the pavement\nBrick buildings, grown ladies jump off the roof\nNigga get paged, then murdered at the phonebooth\nNew York streets made me nigga, it's crazy nigga\n\n[Chorus: Lil' Kim & Joe Hooker]\nTake a journey through the life of these real niggas\nThe things that they seen it would thrill niggas\nIf you've seen what they've seen, you would wonder\nThrough the rain and the pain and the thunder\nBy the time that you realized that it's goin' down\nYou may find yourself going underground\nWhen they see that this life is upon us\nWe would see that there's no one that we can trust", "image":

real niggas\n(You'll never see what I've seen)\n\n[Verse 1: Puff Daddy]\nWhen I sleep I dream of, bodies in streams of blood\nNaked bitches, dead nigga's ghost\nFeds with toast knockin' my door down, sweat poor down\nMy body roast from the heat, so I soak my sheets\nWake up shiverin', pull my hoe close to me, she sexy\nEvery night is different pussy since my girl left me\nAnd I tried to make her stay with me, but I stay busy\nAnd her friends are cut-throats, they deep throat to lay with me\nI reminisce how I miss her and stare into space\nResort to the lips of a stripper, sprayin' their face\nLampin' in a mansion, home alone\nI hear footsteps, shit I kicks just not lyrics\nI hold a fifth, wonderin' if ten shots can stop spirits\nIf niggas try to rob me, then I won't hear it\nCause it's different from the streets, I'm missin' my hood now\nMissin' all the blocks 'cause I'm surrounded by woods now\nIt's supposed to be good now\nIt's like a walking tightrope and can't look down, fire below me\nNow the fantasies I have for women are unholy\nSuccess, thousand dollar bottles impress\nModels with fat ass and big breasts\nFloor seats, Knicks vs. Nets, private jets\nMillionaire heir to Antigua, with Ananda, the MTV diva\nNas, how do we survive all this mess? (I didn't survive)\nEast vs. West the rap game where words became flesh\nA whole pound of herb won't desolve my stress\nStill I ride to the death, love hip hop\nCause Afrikabababa was def, a lot of respect\nFeel Me? Fuck to the rock Sean John jury\nI got the same hands of crap platinum and the crap pyramids\nWrite about the black experience, sell it to Marimax\nTell me if you feelin' that\n\n[Chorus: Lil' Kim & Joe Hooker]\nTake a journey through the life of these real niggas\nThe things that they seen it would thrill niggas\nIf you've seen what they've seen, you would wonder\nThrough the rain and the pain and the thunder\nBy the time that you realized that it's goin' down\nYou may find yourself going underground\nWhen they see that this life is upon us\nWe would see that there's no one that we can trust\n\n[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]\nYou can never see what I see, motherfucker\nBeanie Sigel, the realest nigga from the streets was taught\nStay cased up nigga, stay deep in court\nReminiscin' on that cold cell, deep in thought\nGettin' skinny, couldn't eat, cause the meat was poor\nYa'll niggas couldn't live my life, I've been through it\nStreached up in hospital beds, fed fluid\nTwo bullets hit my leg, one passed through it\nSaw the blood and the hole in my calf, looked through it\nMy life's no joke, I don' played dice with soap\nUpstate the case niggas slice your throat\nWear your boxers in the shower when you guard your soap\nI done seen the biggest niggas in the yard get broke\nI done took blocks to war, took blocks for fall\nTook blocks to Wall for blocks of raw\nWhat you think .33 in the Glock is for?\nBlack fatigues, skullies and binoculars\nC4, block your doors, niggas can't stop this war\nI show you faggots what this Swatz' is for\nHidding spots in the door for the Glocks is for\nRead the papers, '94 I took the cops to war\nHalf of ya'll niggas livin' a lie\nOnly reason why you switchin' up your jewelry?\nCause you keep gettin' robbed\nI looked that nigga in the eyes before I send him to God\nBeanie Sigel, Desert Eagle, realest nigga alive\n\n[Chorus: Lil' Kim & Joe Hooker]\nTake a journey through the life of these real niggas\nThe things that they seen it would thrill niggas\nIf you've seen what they've seen, you would wonder\nThrough the rain and the pain and the thunder\nBy the time that you realized that it's goin' down\nYou may find yourself going underground\nWhen they see that this life is upon us\nWe would see that there's no one that we can trust\n\n[Verse 3: Nas]\nAyo, ayo, gangsta, gangsta\nThe Bible has words that Christ wrote, evil men sacrifice goats\nI speak all my life under oath\nSince a kid, troublesome\nThrowin' shit at little girls jump ropes\nBustin' BB guns at stray cats, that was way back\nWatched it die, covered in flies\nThen I picked up a stick, try to dig in its eyes\nMakin' dirt pies, na, being buggy-eyed shit\nAnd every other nigga that rap, sound like my shit\nI wear chrome .45's with ice on the grip\nI don't shoot it, I roll with killers and criminals\nWith heroin habits they picked up from the penile\nThey let you have it, all I do is give them a smile\nLifestyle of the realest, you ain't ruthless you bitch\nI got a pine box just your size, I know it fit\nYour whole life's a mistake, stop holdin' the pen\nKill yourself, come back as a man over again\nCause in this lifetime I'm reigning, slay men\nLeave your whole body cold\nYour nails grow long, you get gray skin\nMay this nigga rest in peace, Amen\nI run with brave men, straight out the housin', we wildin'\nNames engraved in the pavement\nBrick buildings, grown ladies jump off the roof\nNigga get paged, then murdered at the phonebooth\nNew York streets made me nigga, it's crazy nigga\n\n[Chorus: Lil' Kim & Joe Hooker]\nTake a journey through the life of these real niggas\nThe things that they seen it would thrill niggas\nIf you've seen what they've seen, you would wonder\nThrough the rain and the pain and the thunder\nBy the time that you realized that it's goin' down\nYou may find yourself going underground\nWhen they see that this life is upon us\nWe would see that there's no one that we can trust"}}, {"title":

eh\n\n[Verse One: Puff Daddy]\nYeah yeah, uh-huh, check it out, yeah, c'mon\nWhether you like it hard or the live guitars\nAnything dropped if it's hot it's ours\nIf it's not it's yours, we on the job\nEverybody eatin, everybody involved\nYou can't stop that like you can't stop rap\nBad Boy stop what's the chance of that?\nWe don't stop, so check the, mansions and stacks\nAnd we don't have to answer to Jack\nNo wonder we had this rap shit locked, for eight straight summers\nPull up at the party, eight straight Hummers\nSix be the 6th 7th and 8th wonders\nPop corks, we be the toast of New York\nAnd out West, we want y'all to understand\nAll we wanna do is make you dance\nWe know the song ain't done wrong when the party is hot\nY'all don't really want us to stop, do you?\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse Two: Lil' Kim]\nWhen it comes to the cheese, baby girl roll dough\nFuck Domino's, strictly dice\nBet you niggas won't flow for this ice, notes is the price\nLil sis' walk away with the dough, y'all niggas still broke\nWhile my pockets on re-up\nY'all niggas shit on E, what a pi-ty\nAin't it a shame how your man chose me\nAnd you wanna know why, it's mad simple\nEven in the winter, still pull a baller wit my dimples\nDrive a Tahoe, wit plenty cash flow\nHe know, anything I touch I blow\nAnd I crush a show, wit my luscious flow\nGotta crew full of niggas and a Lexus too\nAll of them hold me down while I'm pressin you\nSo who stressin who, and even though my nigga gone\nLil' Kim and Puff Daddy keep keepin it on\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse Three: Puff Daddy]\nNow you can pump this in your jeep, on an off road\nPump this to your blows on the way to the tow\nBang this til you're bein old when you at home\nOn the six-four, sittin on chrome\nYo we don't stall we ball while you playin the wall\nWe in the middle of the danceflo', gettin off\nGotta bunch of hot chicks gettin live with us\nAt the end of the night they gonna slide with us\nI could tell y'all the rest but it's ob-vious\nTo the top now, ride with us, c'mon\nWe don't stop, we run the game, we don't watch\nEvery single region, we own blocks\nNever let up, you tell me, who do it better\nEvery single I drop, at least two are better\nThe song ain't the wrong when the party is hot\nY'all don't really want us to stop, do you?\n\n[Hook]\n\nEverything we make is hot\nThought I told you that we never stop\nKeep risin to the top, yeahhh\nKeep risin to the top, yeahhh\n(repeat above four lines over another Chorus to fade)"}}, {"title": "Pain", "album": "No Way Out", "year": "1997-07-01", "lyrics": "There's times in my life where I just\nI just wanna run away, I just\nI just wish the pain would stop\nI don't wanna cry no more\nI wish the pain would go away\n\nStart a day, bad hands make it hard to deal\nSometimes I wanna pull it, end it all with a bullet\nHard to live life to the fullest with all this bullshit\nMad as fuck, a nigga had enough\nFrom jump street, saw my father murder massacre slain\nOne shot took half of his brain, I recapture the pain\nTwenty-three years, three when it happened\nTwenty-six now, still I can't stop the tears\nThen my mood switch, thinkin about this sheisty bitch\nKinda funny cause they fake it when they callin you honey\nOn your dick when they think a nigga, might be rich\nThat's when I shit, cause I know you fuck with me for my money\nLearned the hard way, ain't no correctin the grief\nBaby moms starts sexin, my so-called beef\nDon't give a fuck if they Marked me For Death like Steven\nOr relievin your breathin, long as I'm even 'fore I'm leavin\nPain...\n\nI wish this pain, would go away\nWe're talkin about the kind of pain that\nI wish this pain, would go away\nJust gets all up in your heart, and in your soul\nI wish this pain, would go away\nThe kind of pain that makes you feel like you can't go on no more\nI wish this pain, would go away\nThe kind of pain that I wouldn't wish on anyone\n\nI can't relate to them cats who hold gats at the gate\nIs it my fate, am I that nigga, that they love to hate\nSolely, slowly, cause I rock a Roley they want my brain gone\nCause of a fuckin chain on?\nMigraine's on, now the pain's warm, I stagger\nAnd I'm hopin I don't know the cat with the dagger\nPenetratin my heart, rushed thoughts etched in grief\nTo the City College deceased may you rest in peace\nTo the families, I never meant to cause no pain\nI know the truth, but if you want, then I shoulder the blame\nOvercome at times by uncontrollable flames, and multiple pains\nNow it seems like I'm goin insane\nFor the love of you and hip-hop I expand the news\nBut before my shit drops, I stand accused\nDon't you think I wish we all was rich?\nOne for all it's pain to see your people when they all can't ball\nThe pain..\n\nI wish this pain, would go away\nI wish this pain, would go away\nI don't wanna give no more pain\nI wish this pain, would go away\nI don't wanna receive no more pain\nI wish this pain, would go away\nGod, please take the pain away\n\nI can still hear the shots that left my man Big layin\nOn my knees cryin and prayin, then I said\n\"God why? Got to know how hard we try\nDon't let him die, please don't let my nigga be dead\"\nBut it was too late, California sealed his fate\nGone now, hard to move on now, fuck making songs now\nWish I could die, I could fly\nIf they don't give a fuck, fuck it why should I?\nThat's when Big spoke, pulled up in a glistening 3\nWith platinum wings and said, \"Puff listen to me\"\nHe puts his hands on my head and said \"I live through you\nMake hits continuous, this is what we do\nI know it might be strenous and times is hard\nJust keep the faith cause now we rhyme with God\nPlus you owe it to yourself and don't forget the kids\"\nThat's when I opened up my eyes and new Bad Boy lives\n\nI wish this pain, would go away\nI wish this pain, would go away\nOne day the pain is gonna stop\nI wish this pain, would go away\nOne day there's gonna be no more pain\nI wish this pain, would go away\n\n[Notorious B.I.G.]\nI'm tellin you man\nNow don't let these motherfuckers fuck your shit up God\nI don't give a fuck WHO it is\nDon't let em fuck yo' paper man, please Big\nFocus your mind man, do your albums, make them hot joints\nMan fuck these niggas man\nFuck these niggas man\nAnd I'mma tell the same thing to you\nWhen you get your shit done, watch your money, and\nHopefully, I pray for you, you be the shit\nAnd soon motherfuckers start screamin your name out\nLike they screamin all these other, so-called hot niggas\nNever take your eyes off that shit yo\nTry to get everything you can out of these motherfuckers yo\nAin't no guarantee they gonna love you next year...\n\nI wish this

wish the pain would go away\n\nStart a day, bad hands make it hard to deal\nSometimes I wanna pull it, end it all with a bullet\nHard to live life to the fullest with all this bullshit\nMad as fuck, a nigga had enough\nFrom jump street, saw my father murder massacre slain\nOne shot took half of his brain, I recapture the pain\nTwenty-three years, three when it happened\nTwenty-six now, still I can't stop the tears\nThen my mood switch, thinkin about this sheisty bitch\nKinda funny cause they fake it when they callin you honey\nOn your dick when they think a nigga, might be rich\nThat's when I shit, cause I know you fuck with me for my money\nLearned the hard way, ain't no correctin the grief\nBaby moms starts sexin, my so-called beef\nDon't give a fuck if they Marked me For Death like Steven\nOr relievin your breathin, long as I'm even 'fore I'm leavin\nPain...\n\nI wish this pain, would go away\nWe're talkin about the kind of pain that\nI wish this pain, would go away\nJust gets all up in your heart, and in your soul\nI wish this pain, would go away\nThe kind of pain that makes you feel like you can't go on no more\nI wish this pain, would go away\nThe kind of pain that I wouldn't wish on anyone\n\nI can't relate to them cats who hold gats at the gate\nIs it my fate, am I that nigga, that they love to hate\nSolely, slowly, cause I rock a Roley they want my brain gone\nCause of a fuckin chain on?\nMigraine's on, now the pain's warm, I stagger\nAnd I'm hopin I don't know the cat with the dagger\nPenetratin my heart, rushed thoughts etched in grief\nTo the City College deceased may you rest in peace\nTo the families, I never meant to cause no pain\nI know the truth, but if you want, then I shoulder the blame\nOvercome at times by uncontrollable flames, and multiple pains\nNow it seems like I'm goin insane\nFor the love of you and hip-hop I expand the news\nBut before my shit drops, I stand accused\nDon't you think I wish we all was rich?\nOne for all it's pain to see your people when they all can't ball\nThe pain..\n\nI wish this pain, would go away\nI wish this pain, would go away\nI don't wanna give no more pain\nI wish this pain, would go

Love", "album": "Press Play", "year": "2006-10-17", "lyrics": "[Keri]\nI miss going out, feeling kinda stuck these days (loving you)\nAnd I be on the highway, if only I could leave my place (loving you)\nI used to be a talker but I ain't got nothing good to say (loving you)\nI been trying to hide but its written all over my face\n\nI really thought you were the one, the only one\nI guess that I was wrong\n\nIf everything I thought\nWhat do you do after love?\nWhat can you say when its said and done (nothing at all)\nCuz you can't stop a heart break\nAnd you can't stop your tears from falling down\nSo what do you do? what do you do?\nAfter love\n\n[Diddy]\nI remember first day that I saw her face\nThe feeling I had sorta felt like my birthday\nBeautiful I must say\nShe was my earthquake\nCute face, nice shape, you made my earth shake\nI'mma try keep the faith, do it like the church say\nShe the one for me and I don't care I hear my heart say\nThought I had a home run\nBut I guess at first base I found out the long run\nJust another heart break\nSo how much can my heart take\nYou was like air to me\nYou know I wouldn't leave, I needed you to breath\nSee life is but a dream\nSo its more then I believe\nIf you ever been in love you will know what I mean\nSo god help me please I wanna see the light\nShe keep telling me I'm wrong but I know I'm right\nBut try and prove wrong cos I don't wanna fight\nI know I make mistakes\nBut still I need her in my life\n\n[Keri]\nTell me how I'm supposed to heal this open wound\nAnd tell me who had thought that id be trying to get over you\nI'm stuck in the moment, of memories of me and you\nAnd I can get over it, but I'm ain't sure that I want to\nBecause you made your bed, now you gotta lie in it\nNow all the things you said don't mean a thing\n\nI can't believe I gave you one last shot\nI let it ride now baby its your stuff\nOh so leave your not good for me\nIt took a while to finally come to my senses\n\nWhat do you do after love?\nWhat can you say when its said and done\nWhen its over\nCos you can't stop a heart break\nAnd you can't stop your tears from falling down\nSo what do you do? what do you do?\nAfter love\n\n[Diddy]\nThis is what you made me do\nPay attention\nShe know who I'm talking to, and I know you listening\nI think about you all the time, if not every minute\nI promise hurting you was never my intention\nSomething bout your style, the way that you presenting her\nEverything I see I ever had you was in it\nI apologize for every time that you might have cried\nTheres not enough words to describe how I feel inside\nGuardian angel sent from the skys\nI always knew you would have made a beautiful bride\nAnd that's right\nAnd I wish you could of stayed, so much\nBut I'm stuck when I betrayed your trust\nYou know your love is more than wearing\nDolce and gabbana, gucci and prada, trips to nevada\nAnd I admit that you hurt probably true\nBut I don't mistake the only one I love is you\n\nI love you", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9838b615ada8bf1cb8ebde2f834f419e.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Puff Daddy", "raw": {"annotation_count": 4, "api_path":

"lyrics": "[Keri]\nI miss going out, feeling kinda stuck these days (loving you)\nAnd I be on the highway, if only I could leave my place (loving you)\nI used to be a talker but I ain't got nothing good to say (loving you)\nI been trying to hide but its written all over my face\n\nI really thought you were the one, the only one\nI guess that I was wrong\n\nIf everything I thought\nWhat do you do after love?\nWhat can you say when its said and done (nothing at all)\nCuz you can't stop a heart break\nAnd you can't stop your tears from falling down\nSo what do you do? what do you do?\nAfter love\n\n[Diddy]\nI remember first day that I saw her face\nThe feeling I had sorta felt like my birthday\nBeautiful I must say\nShe was my earthquake\nCute face, nice shape, you made my earth shake\nI'mma try keep the faith, do it like the church say\nShe the one for me and I don't care I hear my heart say\nThought I had a home run\nBut I guess at first base I found out the long run\nJust another heart break\nSo how much can my heart take\nYou was like air to me\nYou know I wouldn't leave, I needed you to breath\nSee life is but a dream\nSo its more then I believe\nIf you ever been in love you will know what I mean\nSo god help me please I wanna see the light\nShe keep telling me I'm wrong but I know I'm right\nBut try and prove wrong cos I don't wanna fight\nI know I make mistakes\nBut still I need her in my life\n\n[Keri]\nTell me how I'm supposed to heal this open wound\nAnd tell me who had thought that id be trying to get over you\nI'm stuck in the moment, of memories of me and you\nAnd I can get over it, but I'm ain't sure that I want to\nBecause you made your bed, now you gotta lie in it\nNow all the things you said don't mean a thing\n\nI can't believe I gave you one last shot\nI let it ride now baby its your stuff\nOh so leave your not good for me\nIt took a while to finally come to my senses\n\nWhat do you do after love?\nWhat can you say when its said and done\nWhen its over\nCos you can't stop a heart break\nAnd you can't stop your tears from falling down\nSo what do you do? what do you do?\nAfter love\n\n[Diddy]\nThis is what you made me do\nPay attention\nShe know who I'm talking to, and I know you listening\nI think about you all the time, if not every minute\nI promise hurting you was never my intention\nSomething bout your style, the way that you presenting her\nEverything I see I ever had you was in it\nI apologize for every time that you might have cried\nTheres not enough words to describe how I feel inside\nGuardian angel sent from the skys\nI always knew you would have made a beautiful bride\nAnd that's right\nAnd I wish you could of stayed, so much\nBut I'm stuck when I betrayed your trust\nYou know your love is more than wearing\nDolce and gabbana, gucci and prada, trips to nevada\nAnd I admit that you hurt probably true\nBut I don't mistake the only one I love is you\n\nI love you"}}, {"title": "Hello Good

spirit fly\nI want it all, no lie\nPicture me pourin' poppin' something imported\nPedal flooring, clutch poppin', boppin' to Lauryn\nNow picture me falling\n\n[Puffy]\nNever seen, never heard, never happened, never occurred\nNow picture me flying 10,000 feet above the sea\nPopping bubbly, you'd love to be me\nNow picture the servants in the cabin with the sweetest massage\nPicture having ice and only wanna speak to God\nPicture your dreams being shattered and your cream being lavished\nAt the same time, tell me what you think matters\nPicture all the money that I've gotten off tours\nNow picture me plotting for more, picture this nigga\n\n1 - \t[Both]\nDo you like it (yeah)\n\tWanna do the things that I do\n\tTell me do you want it (yeah)\n\tWanna know what it's like in my shoes\n\tDo you need it (yeah)\n\tWanna see the things that I see\n\tTell me do you want it (yeah)\n\tWanna know what it's like to be me\n\n[Puffy]\nPicture me wildin', fiendin', reaching for tools\nStraight flipping, losing my cool\nNow picture me gritty, P. Diddy 'bout to run in your house\nThe gun's with me, put one in your mouth\nNow picture me dressed in white linen while your life is ending\nSlightly grinning, picture that priceless image\nPicture me broke as fuck on your block about to open up\nLike Okay nigga, what's up\n\n[Jay-Z]\nPicture me driving a course through your home, bustin' a \"U\"\nScreaming at the top of my lungs \"YOU FUCKING WITH WHO?\"\nPicture me not being that hustler dude\nPicture the Benz, a 5, and the drop not new\nPicture the watch ain't platinum, and the rock's not blue\nPicture y'all niggas not knowing how I do\nPicture me, better yet picture you\nPainting a better picture than the one that I drew\n\nRepeat 1\n\n[Puffy]\nWhere do you go from here when you felt you've done it all\nWhen what used to get you high don't get you high no more\nWhen you got a lot of cars, don't even drive no more\nWhen you're expected to win, they ain't surprised no more\n\n[Jay-Z]\nHold up, stop, wait, reverse the tape\nHow much money can one nigga make in one place\nHow much dough could you hold in one safe\nHow many hoes can a nigga really chase\n\n[Puffy]\nWhere do you go after the applause\nAfter all the Soul Train and Grammy awards, after the tours\nAfter asking these whores what they after me for\nIs it the money?  The fame?  The house, take it all\n\n[Jay-Z]\nThe sky's the limit, but I ain't done jumping\nMoney is fast, but I ain't done running\nPicture me driving some wack shit\nPicture me folding under pressure, picture that shit\n\nRepeat 1 until fade"}}, {"title": "I Got the Power", "album": "No Way Out", "year": "1997-07-01", "lyrics": "[Verse One: Styles P]\nMy click is in it til it's over, never sober\nBustin over, lay in the lane with the 'caine in the Rover\nPray to Jehovah, for the nigga with the Ruger\nThe young Don, the Heron mover\nYou know my hustle, I bring the fo' pound to the tussle\nMotherfuck your pit with no muzzle\nSo chill cuzo, let me blow for my niggas\nRunnin round, get down like motherfuckin gorillas\nShorty bop the wolop, in the spot with the dollop\nPot full of acid, I got the game mastered\nMove dimes, hit twenties addicted to gettin money\nIt could be a hundred degrees and never look sunny\nBlack I'm tryin to live, somethin got to give\nBut everyday's the same old, runnin from po-po\nMom think I'm loco, cause I sell crack and puff cocoa\nYo, it's the style see it's still the same\nAnd when worse comes to worse, I steal the 'ciane\nPapi know my face, so he don't expect it\nRunnin from the gutter so he gots to accept it\nStripped his ass naked, then I put a slug in him\nHe just another motherfucker, ain't no love in him\nI put a bug in him, never sleep on one who never slept\nI take my last breath every time I hit the meth\nIt's the D to the E, M to the O N\nBlowin, steady playin shotgun, throwin\nDon't you see the shorty with the baseball cap\nDon't make me flip motherfucker with this baseball bat\nBest to brace yo' gat, 'fore I brace mine, cause I lace nine\nFrom yo' dome to yo' motherfuckin spine\n\n[Hook: Puff Daddy]\nI be, that nigga that yo' niggas can't fuck wit\nThat nigga that yo' bitches wanna creep wit\nThat nigga that you can't get along wit\nPlaya hate but you wanna do a song wit\nThat nigga that you see in the videos\nThat nigga with the jewels and the jiggy hoes\nThat nigga that'll die for his main man\nThat nigga with the gettin money gameplan\n\n[Verse Two: Sheek]\nHaven't you heard that Bad Boys move in silence yet?\nWhen you increase the peace, the mo' wild it get\nI'm only sizin you niggas from the waist up\nAnd I ain't, wettin no parts you can't touch with makeup\nMr. Jacob without the Ladder\nIt don't matter clap your wake up and do a shakeup\nNobody badder, since the, baby finksta\nI was in the playpen wai-tin for kids to enter\nShit I even blitz the rich to get chips\nHousekeeper disguised with the nine bubble grip\nExtra clip in the vacumn if I slip\nRoom service ring the alarm and get the bomb\nBlown to Hong Kong wide been long gone\nPlus I got the power to ramshack, you dig that?\nWorldwide while you simply thug where you live at\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse Three: Jadakiss]\nYou don't really wanna get involved, with the L-O-X car-tellers, Goodfellas, that's who we are\nYou can't outsell us, it ain't shit you could tell us\nJealous dog, cause we spread like relish\nBad Boys, and we all eat together\nWhen it go down, then we draw heat together\nSince I made the connection with the big man\nI done got big plans, to be a little nigga in the big Land\nGhetto star, presidential all gift wrapped\nAnd what you call weight?

Jehovah, for the nigga with the Ruger\nThe young Don, the Heron mover\nYou know my hustle, I bring the fo' pound to the tussle\nMotherfuck your pit with no muzzle\nSo chill cuzo, let me blow for my niggas\nRunnin round, get down like motherfuckin gorillas\nShorty bop the wolop, in the spot with the dollop\nPot full of acid, I got the game mastered\nMove dimes, hit twenties addicted to gettin money\nIt could be a hundred degrees and never look sunny\nBlack I'm tryin to live, somethin got to give\nBut everyday's the same old, runnin from po-po\nMom think I'm loco, cause I sell crack and puff cocoa\nYo, it's the style see it's still the same\nAnd when worse comes to worse, I steal the 'ciane\nPapi know my face, so he don't expect it\nRunnin from the gutter so he gots to accept it\nStripped his ass naked, then I put a slug in him\nHe just another motherfucker, ain't no love in him\nI put a bug in him, never sleep on one who never slept\nI take my last breath every time I hit the meth\nIt's the D to the E, M to the O N\nBlowin, steady playin shotgun, throwin\nDon't you see the shorty with the baseball cap\nDon't make me flip motherfucker with this baseball bat\nBest to brace yo' gat, 'fore I brace mine, cause I lace nine\nFrom yo' dome to yo' motherfuckin spine\n\n[Hook: Puff Daddy]\nI be, that nigga that yo' niggas can't fuck wit\nThat nigga that yo' bitches wanna creep wit\nThat nigga that you can't get along wit\nPlaya hate but you wanna do a song wit\nThat nigga that you see in the videos\nThat nigga with the jewels and the jiggy hoes\nThat nigga that'll die for his main man\nThat nigga with the gettin money gameplan\n\n[Verse Two: Sheek]\nHaven't you heard that Bad Boys move in silence yet?\nWhen you increase the peace, the mo' wild it get\nI'm only sizin you niggas from the waist up\nAnd I ain't, wettin no parts you can't touch with makeup\nMr. Jacob without the Ladder\nIt don't matter clap your wake up and do a shakeup\nNobody badder, since the, baby finksta\nI was in the playpen wai-tin for kids to enter\nShit I even blitz the rich to get chips\nHousekeeper disguised with the nine bubble grip\nExtra clip in the vacumn if I slip\nRoom service ring the alarm and get the bomb\nBlown to Hong Kong wide been long gone\nPlus I got the power to ramshack, you dig that?\nWorldwide while you simply thug where you live at\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse Three: Jadakiss]\nYou don't really wanna get involved, with the L-O-X car-tellers, Goodfellas, that's who we are\nYou can't outsell us, it ain't shit you could tell us\nJealous dog, cause we spread like relish\nBad Boys, and we all eat together\nWhen it go down, then we draw heat together\nSince I made the connection with the big man\nI done got big plans, to be a little nigga in the big Land\nGhetto star, presidential all gift wrapped\nAnd what you call weight? I know cats who sniff that\nEnjoy life, what are you sayin?\nIf the DA ain't got a nigga payin, papi got him weighin\nAnything to do with money you can count J in\nNext time we bring it to these faggots we ain't playin\nCream of the crop, and we ain't never gon' stop\nHittin you in your head with that butter from The Lox\n\n[Hook] - fades out"}}, {"title": "Strobe Lights", "album": "Last

love her lasts forever\nForever's just a word, I put words together\nSteppin' on the stars, she pause\nAnd I know that one day this show will end - applause\nThe strobe lights are dancin', we've takin' all the chances\nShe question what we are, and I'll drink to the answer\nCause my heart is out of service, my eyes turn black\nI don't see love anymore I'm blind to the fact\nI got my world in my pocket, cause I ain' tryna drop it\nThe sky is at my neck, so I turn up my collar\nMy world spin around her cause it's a world without her\n\n[Verse 2: Diddy-Dirty Money]\nWhen you know, like I know\nWhen the sunlight falls down\nThere she goes\nStrobe lights dance with the stars\nAnd I just can't live without her\nAnd she knows what she knows\nAnd the rain is coming down\nMy heart is cold, I know she knows\nStrobe lights dance with the stars\nAnd I always take my time\n\n[Hook: Diddy-Dirty Money]\nAnd when the lights fade\nThe lights they turn grey\nBitch, you don't love me no more\nI'm at the end, babe, goin' the wrong way\nAnd I don't know where to go\nI'm on a new way, tomorrow's too late\nBitch, you don't love me no more\nYou got me\nStandin' on the verge\n\n[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]\nLove create wars, I got wounds and scars\nThe strobe lights are dancin'\nDancin' with the stars, but what happened to ours?\nWhat happened because the rain is coming down\nNow we trapped in the storm\nAnd I stepped right out of her spotlight\nAnd into the strobe lights\nI don't need your light\n\n[Bridge: Diddy-Dirty Money]\nI know I know I know\nThat you're no good\nI know I know I know\nThat you make me\nCome back for more\nCome back for more\nEvery time I try, I can't get away\nI know I know I know\nThat love is gone\nI know I know I know\nWhen the lights they fade away\nYou keep beggin' me, beggin' me:\nPlease don't go\n\n[Hook - Diddy-Dirty Money]\nAnd when the lights fade\nThe lights they turn grey\nBitch, you don't love me no more\nI'm at the end, babe, goin' the

show will end - applause\nThe strobe lights are dancin', we've takin' all the chances\nShe question what we are, and I'll drink to the answer\nCause my heart is out of service, my eyes turn black\nI

knows what she knows\nAnd the rain is coming down\nMy heart is cold, I know she knows\nStrobe lights dance with the stars\nAnd I always take my time\n\n[Hook: Diddy-Dirty Money]\nAnd when the lights fade\nThe lights they turn grey\nBitch, you don't love me no more\nI'm at the end, babe, goin' the wrong way\nAnd I don't know where to go\nI'm on a new way, tomorrow's too late\nBitch, you don't love me no more\nYou got me\nStandin' on the verge\n\n[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]\nLove create wars, I got wounds and scars\nThe strobe lights are dancin'\nDancin' with the stars, but what happened to ours?\nWhat happened because the rain is coming down\nNow we trapped in the storm\nAnd I stepped right out of her spotlight\nAnd into the strobe lights\nI don't need your light\n\n[Bridge: Diddy-Dirty Money]\nI know I know I know\nThat you're no good\nI know I know I know\nThat you make me\nCome back for more\nCome back for more\nEvery time I try, I can't get away\nI know I know I know\nThat love is gone\nI know I know I know\nWhen the lights they fade away\nYou keep beggin' me, beggin' me:\nPlease don't go\n\n[Hook - Diddy-Dirty Money]\nAnd when the lights fade\nThe lights they turn grey\nBitch, you don't love me no more\nI'm at the end, babe, goin' the wrong way\nAnd I don't know where to go\nI'm on a new way, tomorrow's too late\nBitch, you don't love me no more\nYou got me\nStandin' on the verge"}}, {"title": "Do You Know?", "album": "No Way Out", "year": "1997-07-01", "lyrics": "Then, there are the times in my life\nWhen I feel, trapped\nFeel there's, no way out\nNo escape\nTo be honest, I don't know where my life is goin\nWhere I'll end up at\nI just don't know\n\nVerse One: Puff Daddy\n\nI looked back and saw the cat focus, took notice\nStayed away from the bogus, til his rise began\nPhillies stacked his grand played the brokest\nTil he seemed hopeless, soon to be the dopest, cat comin\nTrack stunnin, fame singin, his name ringin\nMoney starts to pile, honeys start to wild\nTop notch drop top make everything he drop hot\nHe dream, visualize, plot and scheme\nGot the cream legally without the beam\nWitcha fire eye drive slow, 8-5-0\nJet black tint still, they might know\nWho the cat controllin the strings of rap and R&B\nTrapped inside of a movie starrin me, so far\n\nChorus: repeat 2X\n\nDo you know where you're goin to?\nDo you like the things that life is showing you?\nWhere are you going to? Do you know?\n\nVerse Two: Puff Daddy\n\nShorty was brimmin, singin, hangin with cats who move bricks\nHeard she do backflips, for niggas who stack chips\nSuck for dough, now she fuck for Bills up in Buffalo\nReal G's makin her back swell\nOnly givin head to those niggas who rapped well\nOwned a black cell, flip it, sippin on Whitman cool mints\nRumors spread, half a G she took, six or more\nTwo bagged up, four went raw\nBack of my mind countin up the big score\nViolators from the door, she lookin up from the floor\nSore from all the pain her body couldn't ignore\nSo far from pure, rotten to the core\nEither or, for sure, trapped inside the world of a whore\n\nChorus\n\nVerse Three: Puff Daddy\n\nHard to cope with, all these niggas and dope whips\nWith cash flow, motherfuckers that gotta flash gold\nTo bag hoes, they not nice, 600 circle the block twice\nIn they Roleys they rock ice, to get they hit on\nBitches dyin to get on, suck a dick or get shit on\nDon't understand they playin wit it\nPlayers get these bitches open and let they man hit it\nFuck that, you can trust that, if I had a gun\nI'd release slugs black and bust back\nSee how these players love that, to the point where\nI can't take it, I'm a playa hater, I can't fake it\nI wanna spill myself, to feel the thrill myself\nAnd since I can't be a player, wanna kill myself, trust\n\nChorus w/ variations\n\nI been on this road for a long time now\nAt time it seems like the road is never gonna end\nOn this road there's a lotta, hills and mountains\nPeaks and valleys\nEven a lot of potholes on this road\nIt's never smooth, on the road of life\nI don't know where I'm going\nI just know where I wanna end up at\n\nChorus w/ variations\n\nLord can you help me get there?\nPlease let me get there\n\n*piano interlude, Chorus again*", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9a7dd069eef6cce09cf06300e4d73b51.997x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Puff Daddy", "raw": {"annotation_count": 5, "api_path": "/songs/38132", "apple_music_id": "906589060", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/38132/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "?"}, "embed_content": "<div id='rg_embed_link_38132' class='rg_embed_link' data-song-id='38132'>Read <a href='https://genius.com/Puff-daddy-do-you-know-lyrics'>\u201cDo You Know?\u201d by Puff\u00a0Daddy</a> on Genius</div> <script crossorigin src='//genius.com/songs/38132/embed.js'></script>", "featured_video": false, "full_title": "Do You Know? by\u00a0Puff\u00a0Daddy (Ft.\u00a0Kelly\u00a0Price)", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/9a7dd069eef6cce09cf06300e4d73b51.300x301x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/9a7dd069eef6cce09cf06300e4d73b51.997x1000x1.jpg", "id": 38132, "lyrics_owner_id": 50, "lyrics_state": "complete", "path": "/Puff-daddy-do-you-know-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "recording_location": "Daddy's House (NYC)", "release_date": "1997-07-01", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/9a7dd069eef6cce09cf06300e4d73b51.300x301x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/9a7dd069eef6cce09cf06300e4d73b51.997x1000x1.jpg", "stats": {"accepted_annotations": 5, "contributors": 9, "hot": false, "iq_earners": 9, "transcribers": 0, "unreviewed_annotations": 0, "verified_annotations": 0}, "title": "Do You Know?", "title_with_featured": "Do You Know?

Do you know?\n\nVerse Two: Puff Daddy\n\nShorty was brimmin, singin, hangin with cats who move bricks\nHeard she do backflips, for niggas who stack chips\nSuck for dough, now she fuck for Bills up in Buffalo\nReal G's makin her back swell\nOnly givin head to those niggas who rapped well\nOwned a black cell, flip it, sippin on Whitman cool mints\nRumors spread, half a G she took, six or more\nTwo bagged up, four went raw\nBack of my mind countin up the big score\nViolators from the door, she lookin up from the floor\nSore from all the pain her body couldn't ignore\nSo far from pure, rotten to the core\nEither or, for sure, trapped inside the world of a whore\n\nChorus\n\nVerse Three: Puff Daddy\n\nHard to cope with, all these niggas and dope whips\nWith cash flow, motherfuckers that gotta flash gold\nTo bag hoes, they not nice, 600 circle the block twice\nIn they Roleys they rock ice, to get they hit on\nBitches dyin to get on, suck a dick or get shit on\nDon't understand they playin wit it\nPlayers get these bitches open and let they man hit it\nFuck that, you can trust that, if I had a gun\nI'd release slugs black and bust back\nSee how these players love that, to the point where\nI can't take it, I'm a playa hater, I can't fake it\nI wanna spill myself, to feel the thrill myself\nAnd since I can't be a player, wanna kill myself, trust\n\nChorus w/ variations\n\nI been on this road for a long time now\nAt time it seems like the road is never gonna end\nOn this road there's a lotta, hills and mountains\nPeaks and valleys\nEven a lot of potholes on this road\nIt's never smooth, on the road of life\nI don't know where I'm going\nI just know where I wanna end up at\n\nChorus w/ variations\n\nLord can you help me get there?\nPlease let me get there\n\n*piano interlude, Chorus again*"}}, {"title": "Everything I Love", "album": "Press Play", "year": "2006-10-17", "lyrics": "[Verse 1 - Diddy]\nThe world at my sneakers\nGold pieces moulded with Jesus features\nGive streets the fever from the way I spit the Ether\nCame on the scene at 19 a gritty fiend for\nMoney, power, respect, get it by any means uh\nNew Yorker, slick talker, walk like a brick flipper\nDecimal doctor, multiply to get richer\nI'm a entrepreneur, I'm the heart of the city\nI'm a part of the sewers, I'm the honorable diddy\nI taste the dirt in my sweat, that's from the Harlem struggle\nAll in my swagger that's the reason why I got my hustle\nI got the highest stature, Miami diamond flasher\nI got you caught in the most flyest and stylish rapture\nMy signature next to Christopher Wallace, get it honest\nMy first album due to him, that was my biggest project\nNow I'm the illest known to walk like the illest soldier\nAnd when I smoke, only roll up with the illest doja\nYou sit and mull it over my venom a killer cobra\nIt's Harlem USA I diddy bop and shop with Oprah\n(Yeah nigga, what.)\n\n[Hook - Cee-Lo]\nNigga what\nFrom my voice I'm killing 'em\nI shed my blood\nAbout everything I love\n\n[Verse 2 - Diddy]\nTo the eye blacker, over handed face the palm smacker\nGood scrapper, cat stacker, good wood packer\nTear up the Dom P wrappers faster\nPlatinum Patr\u00f3n splasher, fuck cris, spit atcha\nI call it rich ignorant laughter\nBlack American express card all grey now, its scratched up\nFrom constant usage, girl kidnapper, pop tags off tags\nPoppa making monster music, and still I Costra Nostra\nBig roaster, skin cola, girl when I send for ya\nBring friends wontcha?\nI'm from the 80's NYC 5 percent of culture\nBreeze through with that old school blue malaroma\nWrist glowing, ho-ing, fly off in a Boeing\nSlide off with your ho, and spend six figures on her\nMy persona, Sean John unforgivable cologne\nCopping the biggest diamonds makes me sorta bi-polar\nFerrari to Phantom, vehicles for high rollers\nThe studded chain around my neck makes the night colder\n(Yeah nigga, what.)\n\n[Hook - Cee-Lo]\n\n[Verse 3 - Nas]\nThe Queens Crypt keeper, Mets hat rocker\nPretty bitch slobber, Ex-robber\nHeister, my own life biographer\nPants sagging, Bentley whipping\nSummer jam stopper, Tim Chuck wearing\nCranapple Vodka, then I spray choppers\nA doctor in the jungles of Haiti made me\nDraped in paisley bandanas\nSuits with Adam Stacey\nCigar like Dick Tracy\nIts dark I get spacey\nAlcohol and laced weed\nThat was part of my 80's\nThe Cartier consiglieres be near me\nCanary yellow cuts in my pinky yearly\nLiz Taylor tried to jux me\nCause I keep it green like the other side of Bill Bixby\nWhen he gets mean\nThink fast 'fore I blast hoes\nLike Grassy Knoll\nWent from scraggly old clothes to the illest fashion\nAnd realest rappin'\nPablo back on the scene, won't roll back up with green\nStrictly paper cruising through the strip in Vegas\nTwo of New York's biggest niggas\nY'all used to hate us, but now you love us\nNas and Diddy, power hustlers\n(Yeah nigga, what)\n\n[Hook - Cee-Lo]", "image":

Ether\nCame on the scene at 19 a gritty fiend for\nMoney, power, respect, get it by any means uh\nNew Yorker, slick talker, walk like a brick flipper\nDecimal doctor, multiply to get richer\nI'm a entrepreneur, I'm the heart of the city\nI'm a part of the sewers, I'm the honorable diddy\nI taste the dirt in my sweat, that's from the Harlem struggle\nAll in my swagger that's the reason why I got my hustle\nI got the highest stature, Miami diamond flasher\nI got you caught in the most flyest and stylish rapture\nMy signature next to Christopher Wallace, get it honest\nMy first album due to him, that was my biggest project\nNow I'm the illest known to walk like the illest soldier\nAnd when I smoke, only roll up with the illest doja\nYou sit and mull it over my venom a killer cobra\nIt's Harlem USA I diddy bop and shop with Oprah\n(Yeah nigga, what.)\n\n[Hook - Cee-Lo]\nNigga what\nFrom my voice I'm killing 'em\nI shed my blood\nAbout everything I love\n\n[Verse 2 - Diddy]\nTo the eye blacker, over handed face the palm smacker\nGood scrapper, cat stacker, good wood packer\nTear up the Dom P wrappers faster\nPlatinum Patr\u00f3n splasher, fuck cris, spit atcha\nI call it rich ignorant laughter\nBlack American express card all grey now, its scratched up\nFrom constant usage, girl kidnapper, pop tags off tags\nPoppa making monster music, and still I Costra Nostra\nBig roaster, skin cola, girl when I send for ya\nBring friends wontcha?\nI'm from the 80's NYC 5 percent of culture\nBreeze through with that old school blue malaroma\nWrist glowing, ho-ing, fly off in a Boeing\nSlide off with your ho, and spend six figures on her\nMy persona, Sean John unforgivable cologne\nCopping the biggest diamonds makes me sorta bi-polar\nFerrari to Phantom, vehicles for high rollers\nThe studded chain around my neck makes the night colder\n(Yeah nigga, what.)\n\n[Hook - Cee-Lo]\n\n[Verse 3 - Nas]\nThe Queens Crypt keeper, Mets hat rocker\nPretty bitch slobber, Ex-robber\nHeister, my own life biographer\nPants sagging, Bentley whipping\nSummer jam stopper, Tim Chuck wearing\nCranapple Vodka, then I spray choppers\nA doctor in the jungles of Haiti made me\nDraped in paisley bandanas\nSuits with Adam Stacey\nCigar like Dick Tracy\nIts dark I get spacey\nAlcohol and laced weed\nThat was part of my 80's\nThe Cartier consiglieres be near me\nCanary yellow cuts in my pinky yearly\nLiz Taylor tried to jux me\nCause I keep it green like the other side of Bill Bixby\nWhen he gets mean\nThink fast 'fore I blast hoes\nLike Grassy Knoll\nWent from scraggly old clothes to the illest fashion\nAnd realest rappin'\nPablo back on the scene, won't roll back up with green\nStrictly paper cruising through the strip in Vegas\nTwo of New York's biggest niggas\nY'all used to hate us, but now you love us\nNas and Diddy, power hustlers\n(Yeah nigga, what)\n\n[Hook - Cee-Lo]"}}, {"title": "Looking for Love", "album": "Last Train to Paris", "year":

than a mother fucker\nLet's make a movie!\nTwo superstars\nTo big body coupes\nAvatars\nThe marriage niggas stay and they e-condo large\nI stay in Louis bed spurs camouflage\nLet's go!\n\n[Verse 2: Usher]\nShe wants the finer things and all that she can get from me\nShe even wants the lovely cutie on my arm\nShe get it in all way turned up\nShe a rider\nShe says she's in the mood for love\n\n[Pre-Hook: Usher]\nWatch out that girl is trouble!\nThey ain't got nothing on her\nCan't even fight her hunger\nShe a get it girl, watch her do her thing\nWhat she's got she got from her mother?\nShe super straight body shaped like no other\nShe's making her way to my area\nAnd when she gets past security\n\n[Hook: Usher  & amp;Diddy]\nI say:\nHello! Welcome to my table!\nBring your girlfriends\nEverything's paid for..\nWe gone get it in\nAin't that what you came for\nHeard you was looking for me!\nShe say she looking for love\nAnd all the girls in the club\nKnow what's up\nShe says she under cover though\nAnd this is what she wants!\n\n[Verse 3: Diddy]\nStraight off the concord, two cheers and encore\nNice sweats, she feens for one boy\nThe innovator, young Sean combs\nReminiscing me and biggie bringing broads home\nFather figure, hating for them other niggas\nDirty money went and brought a money printer\nNow my money longer on the Mississippi river\nMoney making extraordinary!\nI am the nigga\n\n[Pre-Hook & Hook:]\n\n[Interlude: Diddy]\nYo Usher\nTalk to her!\n\n[Bridge: Usher]\nI... I know just what you liked!\nI... I wanna make you feel good inside!\nGirl if you just give me a little bit..\nI know you gone love it\nI... I know you wanna try\nI.... I'm the only thing on her mind\nTonight... she's mine, oh mine\n\n[Hook: Diddy & Usher]\nHello! Welcome to my table!\nBring your girlfriends\nEverything's paid for..\nWe gone get it in\nAin't that what you came for\nHeard you was looking for me!\nShe say she looking for love\nAnd all the girls in the club\nKnow what's up\nShe says she under cover though\nAnd this is what she wants"}}, {"title": "Bad Boy For Life (Remix)", "album": "We Invented the Remix", "year": null, "lyrics": "[Intro: P.

that's uptown\nYou knew I was comin to put it down so what now?\nIt's the Bad Boy, pull up and break the clutch down\nIn the five-speed, smirkin then pull up at high speed\nCan you enterprise and rise like cream do?\nAnd leave em talk about the last time they seen you?\nGame is magnet, to everything platinum with my\nName attached, can you all do that?\nThink one thing when you read my name\nThat

serve fiends everytime they knock\nJust last summer had the mad Hummer\nThey took that and didn't even give me they badge number\nSo how am I supposed to feel\nWho I'm supposed to call when the shit gets real\nWord man I'd rather dial 8-1-1 when it's important\nPlus they ain't tryin' to score like Ed Norton, word\n\n[Hook to fade]"}}, {"title": "PE 2000", "album": "Forever", "year": "1999-08-24",

nice\nYou public enemy number one right now\nBut Fuck that there spit that hydro-ghetto shit\n\n[Puff Daddy]\nLet's go\nThat's that shit right here, whom shall I fear\nThrow your guns in the air\nSocialize, get down, let your ssoouull lead the way\nCause i'm that enemy that you can't see\nBut you wanna be  you ain't shit to me\nPlaya, It ain't hard for you to get to me\nPlaya, my real dogs  they'll spit for me\nSo if you want whats mine, you gots to have the heart\nI've seen em come and I've seen em part\nIf you ain't want beef then why did you start?\nFront from the light catch shots after dark\nSuffer, duck or you'll catch these\nOn the spot, red dots make em all believe\nAin't nobody kicking the rhymes like these\nSee I do the things that they can't achieve\nSo don't start bassin' n' I'll start pacing\nBets on that you'll be disgracing\nMore hotter than the sun\nI'm living on the run\nBecause i'm public enemy number one\n\n\nChorus:\n\nOne,One,One,One,One\nOne,One,One,One,One\n\n[Puff Daddy]\nLet me ask you, what you got against me?\nIs it my girl or is it the bentley?\nIs it my house or maybe its all three\nI just came up and you're all against me\nNow ask yourself, why is he number one?\nNow ask yourself, who's done what he's done?\nThen ask yourself, you're fit for the long run?\nYou think its a game cause you fucked the wrong one\nAlways with God and I don't swing solo\nNever back down when I gotta throw dolo\nWanna see me out, but I just won't go though\nPretty young things wanna have my photo\nOne in the room hangin' on the wall\nIn rememberance that I rocked 'em all\nGot no time for those that think small\nGrill me in the club cause they can't ball\nHate shot callers\nHate them ballers\nBack in control now I call orders\nIt's no fun fleeing under the gun\nCause they got me public enemy number one\n\nChorus\n\n[Puff Daddy]\nAll you suckers, liars, court testifiers\nWanna infiltrate and break my empire\nI spit lines, hit rhymes\nKeep dimes sweating\nGiving them the juice that they're not gettin'\nA bona fide playa, now who got the flavor\nA non stop, rhythm rock, poetry sayer\nI'm the life saver, the New York mayor\nBefore you try me, you better say your prayers\nMy word to the wise is: \"Do not cry\"\nYou know that i'm gone then say don't die\nI take what I find, put a beat to they rhyme\nThought it was over but I crept from behind\nWanna try to stop me from speaking my mind\nAlmost 2000 and running out of time\nAlmost to the point when I wanna bust nines\nA lot of strange faces, I can only trust mine\nSoldiers in position all on the front line\nDon't make a move till I give them the sign\nKnown as the poetical, lyrical, miracle son\nBecause i'm public enemy number one\n\nChorus\n\n[Hurricane G]\nYeah yeah, that's right Puff\nThat's what I'm talkin about love\nSparklin and glistenin on these motherfuckers\nThese niggas is walkin around like little bitches\nTalkin about what you got and what they ain't got\nThey got a little jealous and wanna bring you down\nBut fuck dat, they just mad\nCause you got all the ladies\nAnd you pushin them bentleys, not mercedes, bentleys\nYou know? and thats just the way the story goes\nAnd thats just the way the story goes\nFuck you niggas and hoes\n\n[Puff Daddy]\nYou think i'ma come this far and let you niggas stop me now?\nHaha picture that....number one, number one, number one\nB-I-G forever... rock on", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/065cf886bd0506edc4b8e75a474a8e06.300x265x1.jpg",

No. 1,\u201d from 1987. Both songs are based on a loop from \u201cBlow Your Head\u201d by Fred Wesley & The J.B.\u2019s. Puffy assumes the role of Public Enemy\u2019s frontman Chuck D, and Hit Squad\u2019s first lady Hurricane G stands in for Flavor Flav.\n\nAt the time of the song\u2019s release, Puff Daddy was at the peak of his celebrity. He had scored four top 5 pop hits over the previous two years, and his romantic relationship with Jennifer Lopez further attracted the gaze of the mainstream. Despite his success, a Puffy backlash was building, thanks to his assault of Steve Stout in April 1999, the defection of Bad Boy\u2019s two biggest artists (Ma$e and The Lox), and the more hardcore direction hip-hop had recently taken.\n\nPuff spent most of 1999 doubling down on opulence and lashing out at those he perceived to be his \u201chaters,\u201d first on Nas\u2019 hit \u201cHate Me Now,\u201d and then on his own lead single, which reflects on how Puff became \u201cpublic enemy number one.\u201d XXL Magazine called him \u201chip-hop\u2019s richest crybaby.\u201d\n\nIn keeping with the day\u2019s trends, \u201cP.E. 2000\u201d was also released as a Spanish remix, a rock remix (which featured Public Enemy\u2019s Chuck D), and a Neptunes remix. Three different music videos were released. Here\u2019s the main one:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZ6nAlmzKv4\n\n\u201cP.E. 2000\u201d was a commercial and critical failure. The song peaked at only #34 on the R&B chart, and failed to make Billboard\u2019s Hot 100. MTV echoed the sentiment of many critics when they called the song a \u201cdesecration\u201d of Public Enemy\u2019s original."}, "embed_content": "<div id='rg_embed_link_38109' class='rg_embed_link'

bitches\nYou got to keep bubblin on em\nPlatinum doublin on em, fuck these niggas\nHey yo, I bumped into these cat an' they was like\n\"Yeah, what up wit that nigga Puff he swear he nice\"\nI said yo, the brother dont swear he nice he knows he nice\nYou public enemy number one right now\nBut Fuck that there spit that hydro-ghetto shit\n\n[Puff Daddy]\nLet's go\nThat's that shit right here, whom shall I fear\nThrow your guns in the air\nSocialize, get down, let your ssoouull lead the way\nCause i'm that enemy that you can't see\nBut you wanna be  you ain't shit to me\nPlaya, It ain't hard for you to get to me\nPlaya, my real dogs  they'll spit for me\nSo if you want whats mine, you gots to have the heart\nI've seen em come and I've seen em part\nIf you ain't want beef then why did you start?\nFront from the light catch shots after dark\nSuffer, duck or you'll catch these\nOn the spot, red dots make em all believe\nAin't nobody kicking the rhymes like these\nSee I do the things that they can't achieve\nSo don't start bassin' n' I'll start pacing\nBets on that you'll be disgracing\nMore hotter than the sun\nI'm living on the run\nBecause i'm public enemy number one\n\n\nChorus:\n\nOne,One,One,One,One\nOne,One,One,One,One\n\n[Puff Daddy]\nLet me ask you, what you got against me?\nIs it my girl or is it the bentley?\nIs it my house or maybe its all three\nI just came up and you're all against me\nNow ask yourself, why is he number one?\nNow ask yourself, who's done what he's done?\nThen ask yourself, you're fit for the long run?\nYou think its a game cause you fucked the wrong one\nAlways with God and I don't swing solo\nNever back down when I gotta throw dolo\nWanna see me out, but I just won't go though\nPretty young things wanna have my photo\nOne in the room hangin' on the wall\nIn rememberance that I rocked 'em all\nGot no time for those that think small\nGrill me in the club cause they can't ball\nHate shot callers\nHate them ballers\nBack in control now I call orders\nIt's no fun fleeing under the gun\nCause they got me public enemy number one\n\nChorus\n\n[Puff Daddy]\nAll you suckers, liars, court testifiers\nWanna infiltrate and break my empire\nI spit lines, hit rhymes\nKeep dimes sweating\nGiving them the juice that they're not gettin'\nA bona fide playa, now who got the flavor\nA non stop, rhythm rock, poetry sayer\nI'm the life saver, the New York mayor\nBefore you try me, you better say your prayers\nMy word to the wise is: \"Do not cry\"\nYou know that i'm gone then say don't die\nI take what I find, put a beat to they rhyme\nThought it was over but I crept from behind\nWanna try to stop me from speaking my mind\nAlmost 2000 and running out of time\nAlmost to the point when I wanna bust nines\nA lot of strange faces, I can only trust mine\nSoldiers in position all on the front line\nDon't make a move till I give them the sign\nKnown as the poetical, lyrical, miracle son\nBecause i'm public enemy number one\n\nChorus\n\n[Hurricane G]\nYeah yeah, that's right Puff\nThat's what I'm talkin about love\nSparklin and glistenin on these motherfuckers\nThese niggas is walkin around like little bitches\nTalkin about what you got and what they ain't got\nThey got a little jealous and wanna bring you down\nBut fuck dat, they just mad\nCause you got all the ladies\nAnd you pushin them bentleys, not mercedes, bentleys\nYou know? and thats just the way the story goes\nAnd thats just the way the story goes\nFuck you niggas and hoes\n\n[Puff Daddy]\nYou think i'ma come this far and let you niggas stop me now?\nHaha picture that....number one, number one, number one\nB-I-G forever... rock on"}}, {"title": "Hate Me Now (Feat.

Timbaland]\nCome here girl\nLet me creep in your world\nLet me see the backside of your moon\nNo vickies only la perl-a\nLet me take you to indonesia\nWhere nobody can reach us\nThere's no need to take your phone\nCause you far away from home\nBaby let me be your tour guide\nI'm your burger\nYou my fries\n\n[Verse 1: Diddy]\nRun through sets\nCome through sets\nChicks hypnotized by my 1, 2 steps\nI'm way too fresh\nSo complex\nNiggas try to predict what I'm gonna do next\nLet's get the party started\nFar from a motherfuckin' starving artist\nGot something to prove\nDon't talk it, walk it\nMy niggas outside on them walkie talkies\nPop that trunk\nPass that dutch\nLet's get crunk\nBaby don't play dumb\nBaby don't say none\nIt's on me\nLouie 13 and the cris on me\nDimes wall to wall in the vip\nThe age don't mean a thing\nI ain't chi ali\nI bring them out with no id\nThem boys they bring them out like I'm T.I.P\n\n[Hook: Timbaland]\n\n[Verse 2: Twista]\nReady for action when I attack on the track\nAnd I flat up a sac on strap on the cadillac and the glove\nCould call me when you start shit with the ambassador of new york\nAnd the queen of the chi\nAnd I'm backing her up\nFlow be ugly but it's a beautiful thing\nAluminum rings\nGet money like I'm moving dem thangs\nI got connects in every section\nWhen I'm up in the hood\nChain looking so nasty all the bitches

can tell ..tell by now\nIf it won't ..work out\n\nBridge:\nLets not forget ..back in brooklyn\nWhere the future ..first began\nLets start again ..can't be over\nThats what i told her ..and then she said\n\nChorus:\nI hate that you love me so much boy\nI hate that you hurt me so much boy\nI hate that you love me so much boy\nI hate that you hurt me so much boy\nI hate that you love me\n\nVerse 2:\n(diddy)\nOne time is enough for me\nClose your eyes, theres much to see\nSo lets jump and both touch the clouds, and we never come down\nIts amazing the view is ..\nOn top of the world where even the air is all brand new here\nFireworks like new years..\nHurt is old news, why would you shed new tears\n\n(dirty money)\nTrust in you ..just enough\nWhen our time ..our time is up\nIf i leave ..will you\nWalk away ..from the truth\n\nBridge:\nLets not forget ..back in brooklyn\nWhere the future ..first began\nLets start again ..can't be over\nThats what i told her ..and then she said\n\nChorus:\nI hate that you love me so much boy\nI hate that you hurt me so much boy\nI hate that you love me so much boy\nI hate that you hurt me so much boy\nI hate that you love me\n\nVerse 3:\n(dirty money)\nThings i know now, dont allow me to turn back\nWe been through it all but now i just want my heart back\nAnd i could walk away but see your love is my weakness\nOh' it could be pointless to try and walk away, thats why\n\nChorus:\nI hate that you love me so much boy\nI hate that you hurt me so much boy\nI hate that you love me so much boy\nI hate that you hurt me so much boy\nI hate that you love me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/eb1fc48a136a9ccd12db01d345a9d8a2.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Puff Daddy", "raw": {"annotation_count": 1, "api_path":

billion of y'all motherfuckers\nI will never stop\n\n[Verse 1: Puff Daddy]\nI bust six out the roof of my Bentley Coupe\nHead shots so mother fuckers can't regroup, can't recoup\nI'll be damned if you get more points than me\nSell more joints than me\nSteal your faith, take a puff, inhale my name\nSmoke on it, shit, choke on it\nBitch nigga, I'ma make a hit, nigga\nHot motherfucker down to the skit, nigga\nGame over playa, and nigga ya scored low\nHit me later young'un, and I'm at the award show\nBank account ten digits and it's all 0's\nI floss the most shit, fuck the most hoes\nCome on, you can even ask Don Juan\nIt's official now, they all rock Sean John\nMight have to change my name to strong arm\nYou came to get money man?\nThat shit been long gone, come on\n\n[Verse 2: Shyne]\nPromise to do a nigga since Nicolas Barnes\nPoppin' and choppin' until the day that I'm gone\nShyne po', playa's dreams come through on vinyl\nProminent premier, premium bravo\nWatch him explain ain't nothin' but blood thug crime though\nShots in the spinal for my rivals\nCross the T's and dot the I's and\nPay the judge, drop the top and let's ride\nShit, it's the kid, rappers fearin'\nYou cowards don't know? I'd rather be racketeerin' somewhere\nBustin' shots in the atmosphere and\nNot carin', fuckin' the prosecutor at my hearin'\nMoney launderin', honies wonderin'\nWho me? I reply casually\nI'm what God would be if he was a straight G\nTonight, too tight, arrogant, bitch, we ride\n\n[Verse 3: Redman]\nYo yo yo, it's your hide\nGrab the rope and yell rawhide\nFront line is pussy, call off sides\nI'm focus but my hand is cross-eyed\nI left my gun home, here borrow mine\nPop the nine like the judge \"All rise\"\nThis gun'll knock plants off tall guys\nWe value-packs, y'all small fries\n(Yo, I'm from the projects)\nYo, but on the floor tied\nDon't matter, we'll take up all size\nTruly yours Doc, then PPP hide, my name is\nSince five, I talk jive\nIn church dressed in corduroy ties\nNow I'm grown up and been married four times\nBesides, I'm just a sight for sore eyes\nBrick city, known pop the door wide\nStolen Bonneville in New York High\n\n[Verse 4: G-Dep]\nReversin' the plot\nLast come, first one to rot, burstin' the Glock\nIf I miss, circlin' the block, servin' the pot\nAnd I be the person to watch\nIf your girl missin' the rock, purse and a watch\nHot as it gets, from Hell came outta you depths\nBuy the cassette, rewind it to death\nAlota y'all sweat it, you try to forget\nHow I rock shit from N.Y. to Tibet\nYou got it to bet? That's just how you got into debt\nYou lost when you nodded your neck\nThrough the vest, through the chest that you tried to protect\nTake the voice that you try to project, check\nDarin' you to kid, cat shootin' sperm in you wiz\nI'm why you smell herb in the crib\nMan I'm out for doubtful, shit I spit a mouthful\nIndo out-do, intro to outro\n\n[Verse 5: Sauce Money]\nI'm the hottest thing spittin' so go warn your clique\nThem niggas y'all look up to is on my dick\nSauce motherfuckin' born to hit\nI get so far up in your ass, think I was on some shit\nLook, you against me is really nothin' to see\nWho, when, where, what it's gon' be\nI don't give a fuck if it's he or she\nI'm the virgin of hip hop, nobody fuckin' with me\nI know your type, you a ride dick nigga\nCry sick nigga, lied quick nigga\nOut of turn speakin', first one leakin'\nAlways the Suzuki, side kick nigga\nBitches don't cast stones down, they throw bricks\nWhy I come through and tell 'em to blow dick\nThese niggas the nicest? No, go fish\nSauce, you the best motherfucker, no shit\n\n[Verse 6: Cee-Lo]\nYou're treated and competed, walk away from it undefeated\nObserve it from over there, okay\nAin't It obvious we overheated\nYou talkin' that slick shit\nBut I jus' know that you meant me\nBut evidently, you don't know\nI get your ass gone permanently\nIt ain't complex\nI'll just bang holes or you're ablin' to ask who next\nDo a drive-by on your project, take the traps\nCome on and get some of our gun craps\nI'll straighten out the nigga now\nWhen I snap, make your chest cavity collapse\nWhen I glide the entire map\nWith the frequent four alarm fire, rap straight up\nPut weight down, fuck around, you ate up\nAnd nigga when I eat, I mean I lick the whole plate up\nLook in my eyes, I'm not scared\nSucka, you heard what I said\nIf you don't wanna get dead\nNo it ain't no cure, ice cold in the low, the go-rilla\nThe mo' scrilla the more real-la, I live to rule\n\n[Verse 7: Busta Rhymes]\nYo, yo yo, yo yo\nDon't hold me back, you bet\nHow many nigga's think they fuckin' with mines\nA nigga God blessed with such an undeniable shine\nI hope you know there's nothin' fresher\nThe manifester apply the pressure\nTie you up and gag you in your mouth with a piece of polyester\nNow fix your fuckin' face up\nEmpty the chest of drawers before I stretch your jaw\nEverybody hit the FUCKIN' FLOOR!\nOnly the real motherfuckers belong\nI hope niggas don't end the party before we finish the song\n(Bitch nigga)\nYou be the last to come and harrass, reflect on the past\nWhen I used to pull spine outcho ass\nLive niggas go stack money, continue to build shit\nLong as I'm in this fucker I'm determined to kill shit\nZap niggas like cellular flips and swell up your lips\nFuck with so much dick in their ass it's shrinkin' her hen house\nHey yo, before you empty your clip and pull at your trigger\nSalute the legacy of these throroughly recognized niggas", "image":

stop\n\n[Verse 1: Puff Daddy]\nI bust six out the roof of my Bentley Coupe\nHead shots so mother fuckers can't regroup, can't recoup\nI'll be damned if you get more points than me\nSell more joints than me\nSteal your faith, take a puff, inhale my name\nSmoke on it, shit, choke on it\nBitch nigga, I'ma make a hit, nigga\nHot motherfucker down to the skit, nigga\nGame over playa, and nigga ya scored low\nHit me later young'un, and I'm at the award show\nBank account ten digits and it's all 0's\nI floss the most shit, fuck the most hoes\nCome on, you can even ask Don Juan\nIt's official now, they all rock Sean John\nMight have to change my name to strong arm\nYou came to get money man?\nThat shit been long gone, come on\n\n[Verse 2: Shyne]\nPromise to do a nigga since Nicolas Barnes\nPoppin' and choppin' until the day that I'm gone\nShyne po', playa's dreams come through on vinyl\nProminent premier, premium bravo\nWatch him explain ain't nothin' but blood thug crime though\nShots in the spinal for my rivals\nCross the T's and dot the I's and\nPay the judge, drop the top and let's ride\nShit, it's the kid, rappers fearin'\nYou cowards don't know? I'd rather be racketeerin' somewhere\nBustin' shots in the atmosphere and\nNot carin', fuckin' the prosecutor at my hearin'\nMoney launderin', honies wonderin'\nWho me? I reply casually\nI'm what God would be if he was a straight G\nTonight, too tight, arrogant, bitch, we ride\n\n[Verse 3: Redman]\nYo yo yo, it's your hide\nGrab the rope and yell rawhide\nFront line is pussy, call off sides\nI'm focus but my hand is cross-eyed\nI left my gun home, here borrow mine\nPop the nine like the judge \"All rise\"\nThis gun'll knock plants off tall guys\nWe value-packs, y'all small fries\n(Yo, I'm from the projects)\nYo, but on the floor tied\nDon't matter, we'll take up all size\nTruly yours Doc, then PPP hide, my name is\nSince five, I talk jive\nIn church dressed in corduroy ties\nNow I'm grown up and been married four times\nBesides, I'm just a sight for sore eyes\nBrick city, known pop the door wide\nStolen Bonneville in New York High\n\n[Verse 4: G-Dep]\nReversin' the plot\nLast come, first one to rot, burstin' the Glock\nIf I miss, circlin' the block, servin' the pot\nAnd I be the person to watch\nIf your girl missin' the rock, purse and a watch\nHot as it gets, from Hell came outta you depths\nBuy the cassette, rewind it to death\nAlota y'all sweat it, you try to forget\nHow I rock shit from N.Y. to Tibet\nYou got it to bet? That's just how you got into debt\nYou lost when you nodded your neck\nThrough the vest, through the chest that you tried to protect\nTake the voice that you try to project, check\nDarin' you to kid, cat shootin' sperm in you wiz\nI'm why you smell herb in the crib\nMan I'm out for doubtful, shit I spit a mouthful\nIndo out-do, intro to outro\n\n[Verse 5: Sauce Money]\nI'm the hottest thing spittin' so go warn your clique\nThem niggas y'all look up to is on my dick\nSauce motherfuckin' born to hit\nI get so far up in your ass, think I was on some shit\nLook, you against me is really nothin' to see\nWho, when, where, what it's gon' be\nI don't give a fuck if it's he or she\nI'm the virgin of hip hop, nobody fuckin' with me\nI know your type, you a ride dick nigga\nCry sick nigga, lied quick nigga\nOut of turn speakin', first one leakin'\nAlways the Suzuki, side kick nigga\nBitches don't cast stones down, they throw bricks\nWhy I come through and tell 'em to blow dick\nThese niggas the nicest? No, go fish\nSauce, you the best motherfucker, no shit\n\n[Verse 6: Cee-Lo]\nYou're treated and competed, walk away from it undefeated\nObserve it from over there, okay\nAin't It obvious we overheated\nYou talkin' that slick shit\nBut I jus' know that you meant me\nBut evidently, you don't know\nI get your ass gone permanently\nIt ain't complex\nI'll just bang holes or you're ablin' to ask who next\nDo a drive-by on your project, take the traps\nCome on and get some of our gun craps\nI'll straighten out the nigga now\nWhen I snap, make your chest cavity collapse\nWhen I glide the entire map\nWith the frequent four alarm fire, rap straight up\nPut weight down, fuck around, you ate up\nAnd nigga when I eat, I mean I lick the whole plate up\nLook in my eyes, I'm not scared\nSucka, you heard what I said\nIf you don't wanna get dead\nNo it ain't no cure, ice cold in the low, the go-rilla\nThe mo' scrilla the more real-la, I live to rule\n\n[Verse 7: Busta Rhymes]\nYo, yo yo, yo yo\nDon't hold me back, you bet\nHow many nigga's think they fuckin' with mines\nA nigga God blessed with such an undeniable shine\nI hope you know there's nothin' fresher\nThe manifester apply the pressure\nTie you up and gag you in your mouth with a piece of polyester\nNow fix your fuckin' face up\nEmpty the chest of drawers before I stretch your jaw\nEverybody hit the FUCKIN' FLOOR!\nOnly the real motherfuckers belong\nI hope niggas don't end the party before we finish the song\n(Bitch nigga)\nYou be the last to come and harrass, reflect on the past\nWhen I used to pull spine outcho ass\nLive niggas go stack money, continue to build shit\nLong as I'm in this fucker I'm determined to kill shit\nZap niggas like cellular flips and swell up your lips\nFuck with so much dick in their ass it's shrinkin' her hen house\nHey yo, before you empty your clip and pull at your trigger\nSalute the legacy of these throroughly recognized niggas"}}, {"title": "Peaches & Cream (Remix)", "album": "We Invented the Remix", "year": null, "lyrics": "[Intro: P.

and Cease my witness\nShe said, \"Daddy, when you comin back to hit this?\"\nWhen I went home, I kissed my girl on the neck\nOn my mind was Keisha and how she stayed wet\nSat my girl on the couch, I couldn't hold it in\nAnd said to her, with a devilish grin...\n\nKeisha's got a big ole butt (uh-huh)\nYou know I told you I'd be true (I told you)\nBut Keisha's got a big ole butt (that's right)\nSo I'm leavin you (see-ya! he haha)\nKeisha's got a big ole butt (uh-huh)\nI know I told you I'd be true (I lied baby)\nBut Keisha's got a big ole butt (c'mon)\nSo I'm leavin you (yeah, that's right)\n\nI went past to Rutgers, about three o'clock\nI tried to get a cutie, to ride my jock\nMe and Ma$e, Suburban blastin\nCold Dom P, smilin, laughin\nFreaks all over, the kind I adore\nI felt like a kid in a candy store\nThat's when I seen her, her name was Kim\nShe had the kind of booty that I'd like to get in\nI said to Ma$e, \"Stop the jeep\"\nShe's only seventeen, but yo she's a freak\nI kicked the bass like an NFL punter\nI scooped this beauty, like a big game hunter\nI said to the girl, \"Boo, you look tired\nLet's go to my crib, and bone by the fire\"\nI put her big booty on the zebraskin rug\nShe gave my balls a kiss, I gave her breasts a hug\nI said to this girl, \"I don't love them hoes!\nYou want to get freaky, let me suck on your toes\"\nI licked and sucked, she asked me to sing\nI grabbed a pack of condoms, I pulled out my thing\nWhen I was through, she wiped the sweat from my chest\nWhen to the kitchen, and fried some chicken breast\nKeisha busted in, my house while I was eatin\nYou know what I said?\nToo bad you caught me cheatin, but...\n\nKim's got a big ole butt (uh-huh)\nI know I told you I'd be true (I know I told you)\nBut Kim's got a big ole butt (uh-huh)\nSo I'm leavin you (see-ya! he haha)\nKim's got a big ole butt (yeah, yeah)\nI know I told you I'd be true (I know what I said, but I lied)\nBut Kim's got a big ole butt (uh-huh)\nSo I'm leavin you (that's right)\n\n[Lil' Cease]\nYo, I went to Justin's for some shrimp and steak\nAround the time that this waitress was on her break\nI pulled into the parkin lot and parked my truck\nNiggas playa hate but I ain't give a fuck\nI paid it no attention, and walked inside\nD-Rock had the nine and he was chillin in the ride\nI walked in the place, everybody was lookin\nAnd shrimp and steak wasn't the only thing cookin\nI sat down to eat, and ordered my food\nI said to the waitress, \"I don't mean to be rude\nBut I'll take you on a platter\"\nShe said, \"You got a girl,\" Ceasar said, \"It don't matter\nYou look like you're tasty as pipin hot pizza\nWhat's your name?\" She said, \"My tag says Lisa\"\nI said, \"O.K., you're smart and all that\nBut when you get off work, then goin to snack\"\nShe looked at me and said, \"You need to stop!\nCease where you goin?\"  \"The Marriott\"\nShe looked kind of puzzled, I said, \"You'll see\"\nI pulled out a Benjamin, she looked at me\nWhen she walked out the door, I threw my tongue down her throat\nPushed her back inside and pulled off her coat\nI laid her on the table, and placed my order\nAnd pulled out my dick, and bust all on her\nOn and on to the break of dawn\nAll over the restaurant, word is bond\nShorty said she comin, I checked my Roley\nShe suckin on my nuts, and she don't even know me\nI grabbed my pants, just left my main hoe\nWho did I see, ohh yo... it was Kim\nShe work at Justin's but I kept on bustin\n\nLisa got a big ole butt, uhh\nYou know I told you I'd be true\nBut Lisa got a big ole butt, uhh\nSo I'm leavin you, what, uhh\nLisa got a big ole butt\nI know I told you I'd be true (I'd be true)\nBut Lisa got a big ole butt (a big ole butt)\nSo I'm leavin you\nSee ya!"}}, {"title": "Thought

inside\nIf you need a thing\nAin't never had nothing to me break me down to the floor\nTil' I hide the pain\nHere to show you a compromise of heart for I'm fallin apart\nTil there are no remains\nWhat had me thinking your word was your bond\n(Don't you know)\nThat your never gonna love if you knew it was a situation you knew you weren't ready for\nI could see if your feelings had changed but damn you just slammed the door\nYou told me the one you said you would put down your whole life for\nI can comprehaned the deck of cards you dealt me\n\n[Hook - Brandy]\nHow can you turn on me?\n(How can you how can you)\nHow can you purposely?\n(How can you how can you)\n\n[Hook - Brandy]\nLessoned learned house can burn\nWere close to heat\nBet your words don't mean nothing to me\nThought you said\nThought you said that you loved me\nThought you said\nThought you said that you need me\nThought you said\nThought you said you complete me\nThought you said you were never gonna let it go\n\nThought you said\nThought you said when you held me\nThought you said\nThought you said when'd you tell me\nThought you said no one else could replace me\nThought you said that your never gonna let it go\n\n[Verse II - Diddy]\nThe times that you weren't there\nThe times that you left me here\nThe times that I needed you\nYou know my love is true\nMy passions inside for you\nThe nights that I cried for you\nA man has these feelings too\nSame shit that shall go thru'\nI been here before\nSometimes the pain you ignore\nUntil it's right at your door\nAnd then you just can't take it no more\nWhy does love feel this way?\nWhy does it hurt so bad\n\n[Hook - Brandy]\nHow can you turn on me?\n(How can you how can you)\nHow can you purposely?\n(How can you how can you)\n\n[Hook - Brandy]\nLessoned learned house can burn\nWere close to heat\nBet your words don't mean nothing to me\nThought you said\nThought you said that you loved me\nThought you said\nThought you said that you

when'd you tell me\nThought you said no one else could replace me\nThought you said that your never gonna let it go\n\n[Verse 3 - Diddy]\nThe heartache and pain\nSometimes it goes to your brain\nSometimes it makes you insane\nSometimes our joy is our pain\nCuz it tears you apart\nThese affairs of the heart\nI think I'm strong but I'm not\nAnd when I look in ya eyes\nYou know it kills me inside\nBut I can't wait for that day\nThat you come back to me girl\nAfter we both go away\nIt's just to see if it's real\nThere's no denying the fact\nIt's meant to be if you let it go\nAnd then they come back\nIf this is our last dance we need to practice our steps\nThe situation I left behind but your hearts what I kept\nYou said I did you wrong you did me wrong we was both at fault\nAnd of course you lost me with your alibis\nAnd all of your talking\nAnd most important I just question my self\n\n[Bridge - Brandy]\nThe pain is taking over I just can't believe\n(I need your hand)\nWhat happened then compared to now is dreams\n(I need your hand)\nAnd I know now that you'll need me\n\n[Diddy:]\nI can't sleep, I can't breathe\nI ain't eat in days\nStomach pains from arguing\nDidn't you cheat on me that's how the problems started\nAnd as far as I'm concerned we learned our lesson\nWell it's all in the healing and that process has got me stressin'\nI'm so pressured I'm so physically drained\nI ain't thinkin straight\nI loved you more than my own self\nAlthough I couldn't bear the pain of seein my old self\nYoung wild uncontroled self\nI love you girl\nI don't need no one else\n\n[Hook - Brandy]\nLessoned learned house can burn\nWere close to heat\nBet your words don't mean nothing to me\nThought you said\nThought you said that you loved me\nThought you said\nThought you said that you need me\nThought you said\nThought you said you complete me\nThought you said you were never gonna let it go\n\nThought you said\nThought you said when you held me\nThought you said\nThought you said when'd you tell me\nThought you said no one else could replace me\nThought you said that your never gonna let it go\n\n[Outro - Diddy & Brandy]\n\n[Diddy]\nWhen I look in your eyes\nYou know it kills me inside\n\n[Brandy]\nDidn't you. didn't you...ooohhh\n\n[Brandy]\nLesson learned\nHouse can burn\nWe close to heat\nBet your words don't mean nothing to me\n\n[Diddy]\nThese affairs of the heart\nI think I'm strong but I'm not\n\n[Brandy]\nThought you said thought you said that you love me\nThought you said thought you said that you need me\n\n[Diddy]\nCome back to me girl\n\n[Brandy]\nHow can you how can you\nThought you said thought you said you complete me\nThought you said you were never gonna let it go", "image":

inside\nIf you need a thing\nAin't never had nothing to me break me down to the floor\nTil' I hide the pain\nHere to show you a compromise of heart for I'm fallin apart\nTil there are no remains\nWhat had me thinking your word was your bond\n(Don't you know)\nThat your never gonna love if you knew it was a situation you knew you weren't ready for\nI could see if your feelings had changed but damn you just slammed the door\nYou told me the one you said you would put down your whole life for\nI can comprehaned the deck of cards you dealt me\n\n[Hook - Brandy]\nHow can you turn on me?\n(How can you how can you)\nHow can you purposely?\n(How can you how can you)\n\n[Hook - Brandy]\nLessoned learned house can burn\nWere close to heat\nBet your words don't mean nothing to me\nThought you said\nThought you said that you loved me\nThought you said\nThought you said that you need me\nThought you said\nThought you said you complete me\nThought you said you were never gonna let it go\n\nThought you said\nThought you said when you held me\nThought you said\nThought you said when'd you tell me\nThought you said no one else could replace me\nThought you said that your never gonna let it go\n\n[Verse II - Diddy]\nThe times that you weren't there\nThe times that you left me here\nThe times that I needed you\nYou know my love is true\nMy passions inside for you\nThe nights that I cried for you\nA man has these feelings too\nSame shit that shall go thru'\nI been here before\nSometimes the pain you ignore\nUntil it's right at your door\nAnd then you just can't take it no more\nWhy does love feel this way?\nWhy does it hurt so bad\n\n[Hook - Brandy]\nHow can you turn on me?\n(How can you how can you)\nHow can you purposely?\n(How can you how can you)\n\n[Hook - Brandy]\nLessoned learned house can burn\nWere close to heat\nBet your words don't mean nothing to me\nThought you said\nThought you said that you loved me\nThought you said\nThought you said that you need me\nThought you said\nThought you said you complete me\nThought you said you were never gonna let it go\n\nThought you said\nThought you said when you held me\nThought you said\nThought you said when'd you tell me\nThought you said no one else could replace me\nThought you said that your never gonna let it go\n\n[Verse 3 - Diddy]\nThe heartache and pain\nSometimes it goes to your brain\nSometimes it makes you insane\nSometimes our joy is our pain\nCuz it tears you apart\nThese affairs of the heart\nI think I'm strong but I'm not\nAnd when I look in ya eyes\nYou know it kills me inside\nBut I can't wait for that day\nThat you come back to me girl\nAfter we both go away\nIt's just to see if it's real\nThere's no denying the fact\nIt's meant to be if you let it go\nAnd then they come back\nIf this is our last dance we need to practice our steps\nThe situation I left behind but your hearts what I kept\nYou said I did you wrong you did me wrong we was both at fault\nAnd of course you lost me with your alibis\nAnd all of your talking\nAnd most important I just question my self\n\n[Bridge - Brandy]\nThe pain is taking over I just can't believe\n(I need your hand)\nWhat happened then compared to now is dreams\n(I need your hand)\nAnd I know now that you'll need me\n\n[Diddy:]\nI can't sleep, I can't breathe\nI ain't eat in days\nStomach pains from arguing\nDidn't you cheat on me that's how the problems started\nAnd as far as I'm concerned we learned our lesson\nWell it's all in the healing and that process has got me stressin'\nI'm so pressured I'm so physically drained\nI ain't thinkin straight\nI loved you more than my own self\nAlthough I couldn't bear the pain of seein my old self\nYoung wild uncontroled self\nI love you girl\nI don't need no one else\n\n[Hook - Brandy]\nLessoned learned house can burn\nWere close to heat\nBet your words don't mean nothing to me\nThought you said\nThought you said that you loved me\nThought you said\nThought you said that you need me\nThought you said\nThought you said you complete me\nThought you said you were never gonna let it go\n\nThought you said\nThought you said when you held me\nThought you said\nThought you said when'd you tell me\nThought you said no one else could replace me\nThought you said that your never gonna let it go\n\n[Outro - Diddy & Brandy]\n\n[Diddy]\nWhen I look in your eyes\nYou know it kills me inside\n\n[Brandy]\nDidn't you. didn't you...ooohhh\n\n[Brandy]\nLesson learned\nHouse can burn\nWe close to heat\nBet your words don't mean nothing to me\n\n[Diddy]\nThese affairs of the heart\nI think I'm strong but I'm not\n\n[Brandy]\nThought you said thought you said that you love me\nThought you said thought you said that you need me\n\n[Diddy]\nCome back to me girl\n\n[Brandy]\nHow can you how can you\nThought you said thought you said you complete me\nThought you said you were never gonna let it go"}}, {"title": "We Gon' Make It", "album": "Press Play",

motherfuckers necks\nDo it to 'em daddy, do it to 'em\n\n[Diddy]\nAs my, Daytons spin lowrider sittin low\nHittin corners so hard you can taste my rims\nHard top six-four, I'm Diddy no tint\nI can't hide in New York City\nI'm 'bout it in the South, sleep good in the West\nKnow a chick from Watts with Bad Boy tatted on her breast\nI done been there and did it (I done been there and did it)\nTen years without gettin sweat inside my Yankee fitted\n1990-Raw I showed you ice\nYou ain't know who Jacob was so I showed you twice\nWhen it was +All About the Benjamins+ I had two bezels on my arm\nLike a Don's supposed to, Sean\nRide with a chaffeur in Gucci loafers\nAnd switch to All Stars without losin focus\nThese rap niggas hopeless (hopeless) you can change the locks\nBut I'ma shine for niggas that ain't know Big\n\n[Chorus: Jack Knight]\nDo, seem, like, my, fu-ture's, here, nowwwww\nIt feels good to see the sun in the mornin\nI'm tired of feelin that the people are talkin\nI heard a rumor that things ain't changin\nBut Lord knows that we gon' make it\nOooooooooooooooooooh\n\n[Diddy - over Chorus]\nThe world famous\nAs we proceed\nTo give you what you need\nIt's been so long\nIt's been so real\nSo magnificent, thank you\n\n[Diddy]\nTell me who shot Big (who shot Big)\nAnd take the bullets out of 2Pac's ribs (take 'em out)\nIf I could I would reverse the car, reverse the beef\nPut it all in a pot and boil it on a D. Dot beat (hit me baby)\nSometimes I get drunk, for stress relief\nOther times I put \"Life After Death\" on and peep\nWe ride (we ride) what's a four door Bentley Coupe\nWithout my nigga on the passenger side?\nAnd still I try (I try) to get money stay fly\nFinish the race, holdin my crown high (take that)\nI fly next to God, my eyes on the prize\nBeen away a long time but now I'm reenergized\n(AS WE PROCEED) The life and times of a mastermind (c'mon)\nDedicate every breath to claim my designs (it's mine)\nAnd the day I die, let a G4 fly\nAnd dump my ashes over N.Y\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Diddy - over Chorus]\nY'all know my name, y'all know my motherfuckin name\nI told you I was gon' be great ma\nI TOLD YOU I WAS GON' BE SOMEBODY!\nOhhh!! Feel so good\nFeel so free\nPut your fists in the air, AOWWWW!!\n\n[Diddy]\nI'm the King of all Kings, I abide by no rules\nAnd do what I do by any means (c'mon)\nCall him necessary, the great visionary\nBorn extrordinary, a life legendary\nWho else put flows out, that put clothes out\nFlee the cold weather, short sleeves with my toes out\nNine-six Big showed me what to do\nBut deep in my heart, this is \"No Way Out II\" (let's rock)\nI spend absurd money, private bird money\nThat Bill Gates, Donald Trump, Bloomberg money (you know what it is)\nOld habits die hard, the Vanguard award winner\nNew York torch gripper, O.G. of the floss nigga\nI'm seein visions like I did a bag of angel dust\nThis is life when you black rich and dangerous\nI'm with God, I'ma live on forever\nBad Boy for life bitch, nobody does it better (nobody)\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Diddy - over Chorus]\nY'all know my name, y'all know my motherfuckin name\nI'm in the best shape of my life!\nY'all know my name, y'all know my motherfuckin name\nYEAH! YOU CREATED THIS MONSTER!\nIT'S SO INSPIRATIONAL, IT'S SO REAL\nBAD BOY BITCH!\n\n[Outro]\nSo there y'all have it\nWords from a wise, great King\nWe love it when you speak the truth daddy\nDon't ever stop, please\nDon't ever stop", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9838b615ada8bf1cb8ebde2f834f419e.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Puff Daddy", "raw": {"annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/38152", "apple_music_id": null, "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/38152/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "This is track Number 2 off the October 2006 project \u201cPress Play\u201d which features a couple of guests.

it to 'em daddy, do it to 'em\n\n[Diddy]\nAs my, Daytons spin lowrider sittin low\nHittin corners so hard you can taste my rims\nHard top six-four, I'm Diddy no tint\nI can't hide in New York City\nI'm 'bout it in the South, sleep good in the West\nKnow a chick from Watts with Bad Boy tatted on her breast\nI done been there and did it (I done been there and did it)\nTen years without gettin sweat inside my Yankee fitted\n1990-Raw I showed you ice\nYou ain't know who Jacob was so I showed you twice\nWhen it was +All About the Benjamins+ I had two bezels on my arm\nLike a Don's supposed to, Sean\nRide with a chaffeur in Gucci loafers\nAnd switch to All Stars without losin focus\nThese rap niggas hopeless (hopeless) you can change the locks\nBut I'ma shine for niggas that ain't know Big\n\n[Chorus: Jack Knight]\nDo, seem, like, my, fu-ture's, here, nowwwww\nIt feels good to see the sun in the mornin\nI'm tired of feelin that the people are talkin\nI heard a rumor that things ain't changin\nBut Lord knows that we gon' make it\nOooooooooooooooooooh\n\n[Diddy - over Chorus]\nThe world famous\nAs we proceed\nTo give you what you need\nIt's been so long\nIt's been so real\nSo magnificent, thank you\n\n[Diddy]\nTell me who shot Big (who shot Big)\nAnd take the bullets out of 2Pac's ribs (take 'em out)\nIf I could I would reverse the car, reverse the beef\nPut it all in a pot and boil it on a D. Dot beat (hit me baby)\nSometimes I get drunk, for stress relief\nOther times I put \"Life After Death\" on and peep\nWe ride (we ride) what's a four door Bentley Coupe\nWithout my nigga on the passenger side?\nAnd still I try (I try) to get money stay fly\nFinish the race, holdin my crown high (take that)\nI fly next to God, my eyes on the prize\nBeen away a long time but now I'm reenergized\n(AS WE PROCEED) The life and times of a mastermind (c'mon)\nDedicate every breath to claim my designs (it's mine)\nAnd the day I die, let a G4 fly\nAnd dump my ashes over N.Y\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Diddy - over Chorus]\nY'all know my name, y'all know my motherfuckin name\nI told you I was gon' be great ma\nI TOLD YOU I WAS GON' BE SOMEBODY!\nOhhh!! Feel so good\nFeel so free\nPut your fists in the air, AOWWWW!!\n\n[Diddy]\nI'm the King of all Kings, I abide by no rules\nAnd do what I do by any means (c'mon)\nCall him necessary, the great visionary\nBorn extrordinary, a life legendary\nWho else put flows out, that put clothes out\nFlee the cold weather, short sleeves with my toes out\nNine-six Big showed me what to do\nBut deep in my heart, this is \"No Way Out II\" (let's rock)\nI spend absurd money, private bird money\nThat Bill Gates, Donald Trump, Bloomberg money (you know what it is)\nOld habits die hard, the Vanguard award winner\nNew York torch gripper, O.G. of the floss nigga\nI'm seein visions like I did a bag of angel dust\nThis is life when you black rich and dangerous\nI'm with God, I'ma live on forever\nBad Boy for life bitch, nobody does it better (nobody)\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Diddy - over Chorus]\nY'all know my name, y'all know my motherfuckin name\nI'm in the best shape of my life!\nY'all know my name, y'all know my motherfuckin name\nYEAH! YOU CREATED THIS MONSTER!\nIT'S SO INSPIRATIONAL, IT'S SO REAL\nBAD BOY BITCH!\n\n[Outro]\nSo there y'all have it\nWords from a wise, great King\nWe love it when you speak the truth daddy\nDon't ever stop, please\nDon't ever stop"}}, {"title": "The Future", "album": "Press Play", "year": "2006-10-17", "lyrics": "[Diddy]\nI can't hear you!\nI like it when you say my name\n{*\"The Fu-The Fu-The-Future-ture-ture-ture-ture...\"*}\nY'all gon' love me\nFeelin it's about to get ugly\n\nInject this dose of the future\nTap them veins, grab hold, let me shoot ya\nMainline this new Diddy heroin\nThe Afro-American dream is too evident\nThe potential to be the first black President\nITunes, download me in every resident\nEarly, I skip break-fast\nNigga be on his grind like he need new brake pads\nWe in the hood like black soap and dollar vans\nMy CD's in 3-D, holograms\nThe future, y'all need to holla man\nThe live show's a hard act to follow man\nBronze my likeness, y'all need to follow him\nFrom now to 3000, I'll be a problem man\nThe future\n\nAlways before you\n{*\"The Fu-The Fu-The-Future-ture-ture-ture-ture...\"*}\nAlways ill\n\nWith my demeanor, flip, assemble my own team to\nSay fuck FEMA in case there's another Katrina\nAnd you, laughed at the past, said I was a dreamer\nBut it's, back to the future, sold out arenas\nWe, take 'em to the cleaners, calm ya nerves\nThis is the man who provided more jobs for blacks than armed services\n(Let's go) Cut them corners, stay ahead of them sharp curvages\nYeah, ya heard of us, hits stay superflous\nMan, I extend credit to a vagabond\nRun yo' city, and we not talkin marathons\nBang like chitty chitty here to disturb you\nNew CD, watch it spread like bird flu\nAmerica, fall back, you can't stop me\nGot a thing for pigeon-toed chicks who walk knock-kneed\nSkin-tight jeans we call that botoxied\nI'm desensitized baby, you can't shock me\nI'm the future\n\nAlways before you\n{*\"The Fu-The Fu-The-Future-ture-ture-ture-ture...\"*}\nAlways ill\n\nI went from, blocks to greater to fortunes rock related\nNow my entire crib is voice activated\nTelevision on, Mr. Combs is home\nSolar panel rooftop my, kitchen is chrome\nDim the lights to a purple haze then answer the phone\n(Hello?)

love me\nFeelin it's about to get ugly\n\nInject this dose of the future\nTap them veins, grab hold, let me shoot ya\nMainline this new Diddy heroin\nThe Afro-American dream is too evident\nThe potential to be the first black President\nITunes, download me in every resident\nEarly, I skip break-fast\nNigga be on his grind like he need new brake pads\nWe in the hood like black soap and dollar vans\nMy CD's in 3-D, holograms\nThe future, y'all need to holla man\nThe live show's a hard act to follow man\nBronze my likeness, y'all need to follow him\nFrom now to 3000, I'll be a problem man\nThe future\n\nAlways before you\n{*\"The Fu-The Fu-The-Future-ture-ture-ture-ture...\"*}\nAlways ill\n\nWith my demeanor, flip, assemble my own team to\nSay fuck FEMA in case there's another Katrina\nAnd you, laughed at the past, said I was a dreamer\nBut it's, back to the future, sold out arenas\nWe, take 'em to the cleaners, calm ya nerves\nThis is the man who provided more jobs for blacks than armed services\n(Let's go) Cut them corners, stay ahead of them sharp curvages\nYeah, ya heard of us, hits stay superflous\nMan, I extend credit to a vagabond\nRun yo' city, and we not talkin marathons\nBang like chitty chitty here to disturb you\nNew CD, watch it spread like bird flu\nAmerica, fall back, you can't stop me\nGot a thing for pigeon-toed chicks who walk knock-kneed\nSkin-tight jeans we call that botoxied\nI'm desensitized baby, you can't shock me\nI'm the future\n\nAlways before you\n{*\"The Fu-The Fu-The-Future-ture-ture-ture-ture...\"*}\nAlways ill\n\nI went from, blocks to greater to fortunes rock related\nNow my entire crib is voice activated\nTelevision on, Mr. Combs is home\nSolar panel rooftop my, kitchen is chrome\nDim the lights to a purple haze then answer the phone\n(Hello?) Peep the moon through my retractable dome\nWhat they thought they assassinated was only a clone\nWe about to venture off into the unknown (let's go)\nWhere sunrays hook off layers of ozone\nChips inserted in the brain, the new cell phone\nThe future, fuck with me now\nI'm Grammy certified the committee can pick me now\nAnd they all green with envy like Bill Bixby\nBow down, kiss the tip of my cane, I paid sixty thou'\nYou know the suit stay crispy now\nHands to the sky and get ready if you wit me now\nThe future\n\nNever seen before, never will\nAlways before you, always ill\nI AM!!!"}},

early before I wake\nWe both knew we had to break\nYou could of chose a better way\n\n[Chorus: Carl Thomas]\nWoke up in the morning, you were not there\nAll I seen was an imprint of your head\nIn my

Carl Thomas]\nIt was cold the way you left\nStill the pain is in my chest\nBecause in my heart I felt you should of came and talked to me\nIf you put away your pride\nAnd look deep into my eyes\nIt would of been to your surprise\nThat I got up to apologize\nBut you were gone\n\n[Chorus: Carl Thomas 2x]\nWoke up in the morning, you were not there\nAll I seen was an imprint of your head\nIn my

willow\nWhy'd I treat you so bad\nI should of known one day that you'd be gone\nYou should of known one day that I'd be gone\nYou should of known one day that we'd be\n[Verse One by Carl Thomas]\nWhy did you have to be this way\nBaby all you had to say\nIs that you were sick and tired of the man I began to be\nBut you planned a great escape\nBright and early before I wake\nWe both knew we had to break\nYou could of chose a better way\n\n[Chorus: Carl Thomas]\nWoke up in the morning, you were not there\nAll I seen was an imprint of your head\nIn my pillow, weeping willow\nWhy'd I treat you so bad\nI should of known one day that you'd be gone\nYou should of known one day that I'd be gone\nYou should of known one day that we'd be\n\n[Verse Two: Carl Thomas]\nIt was cold the way you left\nStill the pain is in my chest\nBecause in my heart I felt you should of came and talked to me\nIf you put away your pride\nAnd look deep into my eyes\nIt would of been to your surprise\nThat I got up to apologize\nBut you were gone\n\n[Chorus: Carl Thomas 2x]\nWoke up in the morning, you were not there\nAll I seen was an imprint of your head\nIn my pillow, weeping willow\nWhy'd I treat you so bad\nI should of known one day that you'd be gone\nYou should of known one day that I'd be gone\nYou should of known one day that we'd be\n\n[Break: Carl Thomas]\nOh I thought we had forever, now it's gone\nIt's time to carry on\nI thought that you made me happy\nBut it's this thing that's come between us girl\nAt one time you were my world\nNow it seems it's gone away, gone away\n\n[The Notorious B.I.G. - Rap Verse]\n(Uhh)I dreams filthy\nMy moms and pops mixed in with Jamaican Rum and Whiskey\nHuh, what a set up\nShoulda pushed em dead off, wipe the sweat off\nUhh, cause in this world I'm dead off, squeeze lead off\nBenz sped off, ain't no shook hands in Brook-land\nArmy fatigue break up teams, the enemies\nLook man, you wanna see me locked up, shot up\nMoms crotched up over the casket, screamin \"Bastard!\"\nCryin, know my friends is lying\nY'all know who killed em' filled em' with the lugars from they Rugers\nOr they Desert, dyin ain't the shit but it's pleasant\nKinda quiet, watch my niggas bring the riot\nGiving cats the opposite of diets\nYou gain thirty pounds when you die no lie, lazy eye\nI was high when they hit me, took a few cats with me\nShit, I need the company (uh-huh)\nApologies in order, to T'Yanna my daughter\nIf it was up to me you would be with me, sorta like\nDaddy Dearest, my vision be the clearest\nSilencers so you can't hear it\nCompetition still fear it, shit, don't ask me\nI went from ashy to nasty to classy, and still\n\n[Chorus By Carl Thomas 4x..music fades out]\nWoke up in the morning, you were not there\nAll I seen was an imprint of your head\nIn my pillow, weeping willow\nWhy'd I treat you so bad\nI should of known one day that you'd be gone\nYou should of known one day that I'd be gone\nYou should of known one day that we'd

here\nYeah, yeah\nOne-Two, One-Two, in the place to be\nAs you can see\nI am the crush groovin'\nThere's a whole lot of stars be groovin' in here tonight\nThe record breaking and the record making\nYeah, yeah, turn this up\n\nFrom the states to over seas\nEvery city in between I hit the scene\nCatch fire like kerosene\nGeting paid for more then a decade\nWe been blazing, y'all wasn't ready for the PD invasion\nCaught you off guard, got bitches, got cars\nHealin' war scars, puff smoke out of the jar\nCatch flights to and fro, nigga who you know?\nNo one important, just another nigga flossing\nGotta seal, what I'm touching is real\nYou just a clone wit' a production deal\nI sailed the seven seas and kept my head above the water\nSorry I left you, but now I am back for ya\nBut it's like we never bounced, platinum from word of mouth\nHottest niggas out\nAlot better, the shit's too strong\nI'm home now, daddy's been gone too long\n\n1 - \t[Lil' Kim]\n\tWhat you niggas want\n\tWanna talk slick\n\tWanna do shit, try shit, new shit\n\tWho you fucking wit'\n\tYou and your weak clique\n\tBitch you creep wit' got you in some deep shit\n\tYou coppin' pleas now, it ain't a secret\n\tTrying to be niggas you can't even speak with\n\tYou can't run, you can't hide\n\tBad Boy 'till the day we die\n\nTell they all like Jordan in the fall\nOn top of the hill like Lauren, Killing 'Em Soft'\nWhat you grillin' me for?\nKept my name good, we from the same hood\nMade some change, put the range wit' the stained wood\nNow chicks, they keep they eyes on me\nWanna grind on me\nHaters plotting so I keep my nine on me\nYou can't stop 'em when them shells is popping\nLook good to the public eye, your streets is watching\nAt all times, put it all on the line\nWithout a care dreams of cream turn to nightmares\nNo one to talk to, don't know who to trust\nGot your gun out and don't know who to bust\nIt get like that though, when you stack that dough\nCan't run from it yo, that's when they get close\nSo put up you guards, keep faith in God\nI promise y'all the world'll be ours\n\nRepeat 1\n\nYour games amaze, but alot of ways, many choices\nCan't sleep, when I do I hear voices\nSpeakin' loud and clear, wait 'till you come out this year\nSo I listen back cause the street is missing that\nWhat a world we live in\nSo cold I'm shivering, slipping\nGotta work with what I'm given, shit\nBitches is trifling, hands out grabbin'\nNiggas hating, scheming and back stabbin'\nThat's why they hang around you, just to be seen\nType to leave a gun fight wit' a full magazine\nNo blood, not hit, chamber ain't warm\nWhat part of the game is this? And who's side you on?\nCan't be out for wealth and out for self, won't work\nFind yourself tucked and surrounded by dirt\nIn a verse I show the whole earth my work\nIt got to get better because it can't get no worse\n\nRepeat 1\nRepeat 1", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ebb76937f0f74f437939349d5969abe1.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Puff Daddy", "raw": {"annotation_count": 1, "api_path":

crush groovin'\nThere's a whole lot of stars be groovin' in here tonight\nThe record breaking and the record making\nYeah, yeah, turn this up\n\nFrom the states to over seas\nEvery city in between I hit the scene\nCatch fire like kerosene\nGeting paid for more then a decade\nWe been blazing, y'all wasn't ready for the PD invasion\nCaught you off guard, got bitches, got cars\nHealin' war scars, puff smoke out of the jar\nCatch flights to and fro, nigga who you know?\nNo one important, just another nigga flossing\nGotta seal, what I'm touching is real\nYou just a clone wit' a production deal\nI sailed the seven seas and kept my head above the water\nSorry I left you, but now I am back for ya\nBut it's like we never bounced, platinum from word of mouth\nHottest niggas out\nAlot better, the shit's too strong\nI'm home now, daddy's been gone too long\n\n1 - \t[Lil' Kim]\n\tWhat you niggas want\n\tWanna talk slick\n\tWanna do shit, try shit, new shit\n\tWho you fucking wit'\n\tYou and your weak clique\n\tBitch you creep wit' got you in some deep shit\n\tYou coppin' pleas now, it ain't a secret\n\tTrying to be niggas you can't even speak with\n\tYou can't run, you can't hide\n\tBad Boy 'till the day we die\n\nTell they all like Jordan in the fall\nOn top of the hill like Lauren, Killing 'Em Soft'\nWhat you grillin' me for?\nKept my name good, we from the same hood\nMade some change, put the range wit' the stained wood\nNow chicks, they keep they eyes on me\nWanna grind on me\nHaters plotting so I keep my nine on me\nYou can't stop 'em when them shells is popping\nLook good to the public eye, your streets is watching\nAt all times, put it all on the line\nWithout a care dreams of cream turn to nightmares\nNo one to talk to, don't know who to trust\nGot your gun out and don't know who to bust\nIt get like that though, when you stack that dough\nCan't run from it yo, that's when they get close\nSo put up you guards, keep faith in God\nI promise y'all the world'll be ours\n\nRepeat 1\n\nYour games amaze, but alot of ways, many choices\nCan't sleep, when I do I hear voices\nSpeakin' loud and clear, wait 'till you come out this year\nSo I listen back cause the street is missing that\nWhat a world we live in\nSo cold I'm shivering, slipping\nGotta work with what I'm given, shit\nBitches is trifling, hands out grabbin'\nNiggas hating, scheming and back stabbin'\nThat's why they hang around you, just to be seen\nType to leave a gun fight wit' a full magazine\nNo blood, not hit, chamber ain't warm\nWhat part of the game is this? And who's side you on?\nCan't be out for wealth and out for self, won't work\nFind yourself tucked and surrounded by dirt\nIn a verse I show the whole earth my work\nIt got to get better because it can't get no worse\n\nRepeat 1\nRepeat 1"}}, {"title": "Yeah Yeah You Would", "album": "Last Train to Paris", "year": "2010-12-14", "lyrics": "[Intro: Swizz Beatz]\nLadies and Gentlemen\nI'm here to

star\nCould've been your backbone\nBut now I'm too far away\nYou wouldn't be there alone\nMy love wouldn't be at home\nWe wouldn't be staring out the window\nGuessing which way the wind blows\n\n[Hook: Grace Jones]\nYou would be here loving me, holding me\nTreating me better than before\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you would\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you would\nYou're just so damn selfish, nervous and jealous\nYou would be here loving me, yeah you would\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you would\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you would\n\n[Verse 2: Diddy]\nYeah, come on, oh, who was your number one?\nWho had niggas at the alter wearing fuchsia gators and cummerbunds\nGot my hand on my gun\nAs I'm sittin', drinkin' and thinkin' I love you, you should've had my son\nGot me losin' my mind\nAll alone in my room, starin' at your picture like I'm doin' time\nI know lovin' me's hard\nBut the further you are, I wait got me closer to God\n\n[Verse 3: Grace Jones]\nSex could've been greater\nIf I was the only one, wouldn't be your mistress?\nBut now I'm too far to play (too far to play)\nNow you take the blame alone\nLove wouldn't be free to roam\nWe would be prisoners of the sheets, baby I'll your capture\n\n[Hook]\nYou would be here loving me, holding me\nTreating me better than before\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you would\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you would\nYou're just so damn selfish, nervous and jealous\nYou would be here loving me, yeah you would\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you would\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you would\n\n[Bridge: Grace Jones]\nAll I wanted was your lovin'\nYou keep tellin' me, you wouldn't be happy\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nYou wouldn't let me ruin my heart\n\n[Outro: Grace Jones]\nHoney, this is, oh, so good\nYeah, yeah, yeah,

pimper's paradise\nJewels around her neck getting strong with the ice\nShe said I heard of ya crew I'm the number one fan\nOf the refugees down from the islands\nDriving the Bentleys with her pretty pretty friends\nSippin' colada every day is a weekend\nHeard your name was Pras outta Brooklyn\nAnd fifteen million place with your total sound scan\n\nI loved you since I knew you (I like this part, Roxanne Roxanne)\nI wouldn't talk down to you\nI have you to tell just how I feel (Roxanne Roxanne)\nI won't share you with another boy (Ye ye ye yeah yeah)\nI know my mind is made up (Roxanne

all today you never promised tomorrow\nYeah her moves remind me of kung fu flicks\nThick lips that contradicts rules of the game\nShe plays the politics\nRed light special red light district\nPut on ya make up body all made up\nPlatinum played up Pearl Jam cut up\nRoxanne Roxanne you don't really have to\nPut on ya red dress if you feeling kind of blue\nShe got the hots for the disco jocks\nRock ya socks at the pop of the tops\nNever get cool like to call it Glock\nTwisted minded like Bob Zealot\n\nRoxanne\n(Roxanne Roxanne)\n\nYou dont have to put on the red light (ye ye ye yeah yeah)\nThose days are over\nYou dont have to sell your body to the night (c'mon)(Roxanne Roxanne)\nRoxanne Roxanne\nRoxanne\nYou dont have to wear that dress tonight (remix)\nWalk the streets for money\nYou dont care if it's wrong or if it's right (ye ye yeah)\n\nVerse Two:\n\nYo what's the haps girl, dancing for the green paperback\nSitting at the bar drinking up Cognac\nShe steps in the room, dont know how to act\nSweet in emergence, similar to Similac\nIt was the hat\nCats wanna be around her shine\nShe wants to party, have a good time\nShe feels kind of hot me feelin' feelin' fine\nDiggin' all her life just to get a gold mine\nBro making the streets she's the pimper's paradise\nJewels around her neck getting strong with the ice\nShe said I heard of ya crew I'm the number one fan\nOf the refugees down from the islands\nDriving the Bentleys with her pretty pretty friends\nSippin' colada every day is a weekend\nHeard your name was Pras outta Brooklyn\nAnd fifteen million place with your total sound scan\n\nI loved you since I knew you (I like this part, Roxanne Roxanne)\nI wouldn't talk down to you\nI have you to tell just how I feel (Roxanne Roxanne)\nI won't share you with another boy (Ye ye ye yeah yeah)\nI know my mind is made up (Roxanne Roxanne)\nSo put away your makeup (Roxanne Roxanne)\nTold you once I won't tell you again\nIt's a bad way (Ye ye yeah, yeah)\n\nRoxanne\nYou dont have to put on the red light\nRoxanne\nYou dont have to put on the red light x2\n\nRoxanne Roxanne I wanna be your man\nPut on the red light\nRoxanne Roxanne I wanna be your

really envy me\nI feel no sympathy it's tight ill\nPlus I get slight chills when I write wills\nTired of looking at these ugly niggas with ice grills\nNo tellin' what I might feel about my glory\n2 sides to every story\nThat's why I pray to God hoping that He reassure me\nThe more the pain the more the game come with this territory\nI might dispose feelin' like my life been chose\nAll I know in my life lotta ice and hoes\nWhen it's on\nMy man there gat in his hand\nWhat you do when you got a master plan\nBut half done ran\nHere's ya chance to prove you love 'em\nIt's on and subbin'\nSo hot it's feeling muggy. Really though\n\nChorus\n(Puff over chorus)\nNo matter how bad it gets. It could be worse. Ain't no way out\nI gotta live my life you know. You gave me the ends. No matter\nHow bad it gets there ain't no way out no way out\n\nVerse 2 (Black Rob)\n\nI feel like this approach me with beef ya done\nI shoot through pants no chance to pull for ya gun\nMan a lot of y'all cats can't stand that 1 on 1\nWind up gettin' embarrassed ain't funny uh huh\nDespite the bullshit black still here\nMakin' hits down at Chelsea Bea's\nVia partaking flicks\nNo matter what we have to\nCome strapped with our gats\nWe don't want to\nBut y'all make us act like that\nIt's a thousand Bad Boy cats ready to blam you\nLa Familia I steal ya I know how my fam' do\nMan handle tracks that be laced by Nas\nRolex watch security straight from the Mosque\nYo I'm all on my own G who should I trust\nNiggas bust B.I.G. now it seems they want us\nIt's like no matter what I do\nI can't escape it\nAin't no going around it so\nI'ma be a man and just face it\n\nChorus\n\nVerse 3 (Puff)\n\nIt takes heart just to live in these streets\nYou niggas lift the heat\nTake the bitter with the sweet\nThey can't hurt me\nNo more than they already did\nThey killed Big in my heart he forever lives\nThere's no way out\nLike you got Berrettas to my wig\nWe were slugged then another blood\nShed my ribs uhh\nNow the question is Will I survive?\nNigga gotta make it home I gotta still provide\nAnd I get the vibe niggas wanna live to try\nAin't no tellin' what this Bad Boy feel inside\nBlood

through like us\nThey ain't true like us\nIf they only knew like us\nIt's less than a small few like us\nAnd they ain't pay dues like us\nNever on P's and Q's like us\nThey don't move like us\nThey don't have the right to choose like us\nOr get mad cause they ain't grew like us\nThey ain't on cue like us\nThey don't fit the shoe like us\nDon't know who's who like us (who dat?)\nStrangers, ain't aware of the danger\nThey head's up wit thoroughbred cats\nThat knock 'em back, they get the axe\nAnd a hard case to crack\nI'm a hard face to track\nFast as they can test us\nWe flip 'em on they backs, like that\nThe many men that make us great must stay together\nCause together, we're hard to break\n\nRepeat 1\n\n[Mark Curry]\nLook out mutha fucka\nI tried to warn 'em\nYou don't wanna double cross us\nHaven't you heard how many guy they lost with us\nYou don't wanna floss with us\nCause shit cost with us\nAin't nobody boss but us\nWe got force wit us, of course it's us\nIt's no being better off than us\nAnd ain't a hotter source than us\nAnd these streets ain't divorcing us\nWe ain't got no remorse in us\nKnow to hold your horse with us\nNo cuttin' shorts with us\nHere to stay, no abortin us, no extortin' us\nBetween us we got the mic domain and artillery\nTherefore, it's all free reign, who's domain\nWhen shots ring, who remains, they refrain\nWho walks away with the gain\nUs\nThorough niggas that's hard to top\nTogether we're too hard to stop\n\nRepeat 1\n\n[Lil' Kim]\nAin't a bitch like me that can spit like me\nWho could say they rich like me\nThey don't hold the four fifth like me\nAin't a hit like me\nNobody load the clip like me\nCut coke and flip like me\nMake hit after hit like me\nWear the title Queen Bitch like me\nYa'll ain't good in bed like me\nAnd ya'll don't give head like me\nPlus your crew don't break bread like me\nThink about it, this a one shot deal\nYa'll got one shot still\nWhen my gunshot peel, that's a one shot kill\nI'm so far ahead ya'll can't touch my land spread\nCause most of ya'll is misled and underfed\nHey, what can I say, I'm a little vain\nNow all aboard if you ridin' my train\nChoo chooo, throw it up and represent your gang\nWhether you from the east side (East side)\nOr the west side (West Side)\nWorldwide\n\nRepeat 1", "image":

fuckin' fingers\nAnd say \"That's the bad guy\"\nSo say good night to the bad guy\nGo on\nLast time you gonna see a bad guy like this again\n\n[Puff]\tTo be or not to be\n[Mase]\tMy mother's wrong\n[Puff]\tThat's the question, you feel me?\n[Mase]\tMy father was wrong\n[Puff]\tThey say I'm wrong\n\tSo they say\n[Mase]\tSo they say\n[Puff]\tHa ha, come on\n\tIt's like this right here\n[Mase]\tTo all my niggas, check this out\n\n1 - \t[Lil' Kim]\n\tIt's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit\n\tIt's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit\n\tIt's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta

gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit\n\n[Puffy]\nAin't another crew like us\nThat could do like us\nSee the world from a view like us\nStill always come through like us\nThey ain't true like us\nIf they only knew like us\nIt's less than a small few like us\nAnd they ain't pay dues like us\nNever on P's and Q's like us\nThey don't move like us\nThey don't have the right to choose like us\nOr get mad cause they ain't grew like us\nThey ain't on cue like us\nThey don't fit the shoe like us\nDon't know who's who like us (who dat?)\nStrangers, ain't aware of the danger\nThey head's up wit thoroughbred cats\nThat knock 'em back, they get the axe\nAnd a hard case to crack\nI'm a hard face to track\nFast as they can test us\nWe flip 'em on they backs, like that\nThe many men that make us great must stay together\nCause together, we're hard to break\n\nRepeat 1\n\n[Mark Curry]\nLook out mutha fucka\nI tried to warn 'em\nYou don't wanna double cross us\nHaven't you heard how many guy they lost with us\nYou don't wanna floss with us\nCause shit cost with us\nAin't nobody boss but us\nWe got force wit us, of course it's us\nIt's no being better off than us\nAnd ain't a hotter source than us\nAnd these streets ain't divorcing us\nWe ain't got no remorse in us\nKnow to hold your horse with us\nNo cuttin' shorts with us\nHere to stay, no abortin us, no extortin' us\nBetween us we got the mic domain and artillery\nTherefore, it's all free reign, who's domain\nWhen shots ring, who remains, they refrain\nWho walks away with the gain\nUs\nThorough niggas that's hard to top\nTogether we're too hard to stop\n\nRepeat 1\n\n[Lil' Kim]\nAin't a bitch like me that can spit like me\nWho could say they rich like me\nThey don't hold the four fifth like me\nAin't a hit like me\nNobody load the clip like me\nCut coke and flip like me\nMake hit after hit like me\nWear the title Queen Bitch like me\nYa'll ain't good in bed like me\nAnd ya'll don't give head like me\nPlus your crew don't break bread like me\nThink about it, this a one shot deal\nYa'll got one shot still\nWhen my gunshot peel, that's a one shot kill\nI'm so far ahead ya'll can't touch my land spread\nCause most of ya'll is misled and underfed\nHey, what can I say, I'm a little vain\nNow all aboard if you ridin' my train\nChoo chooo, throw it up and represent your gang\nWhether you from the east side (East side)\nOr the west side (West Side)\nWorldwide\n\nRepeat 1"}}, {"title": "I Need A Girl Pt.2", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "[P.

You thinkin' there be no repentance?\nBut I'm coming back with a vengence\nRunnin' like a ant since it was intense\nThought it was the end\nWish every motherfucker's in like sentence\nWhere they been since?\nLet me not go deep in the story\nBut damn it, I feel the fury when I'm rapping\nGot me going off in the zone\nHit eleven niggas and bitches at home\nHear the drama how it happen\nBack for one minute\nYou remember I was grazed in the shoulder\nWhen I plays the beholder\nHit the land like a crusier\nBut in the Range with the Rov'\nStill it feelin' strange to a soldier\nMe and Puff trapped in the parking lot\nI done found the keys so let's crawl on the floor\nGot up beside the ride but we still trapped\nBut I found my strap, I gotta bust that ho\nP., you gotta drive, problem at the angle of the ride\nBlast when you crash through the exit\nWe still alive but the opposition gotta die\nWhen they go then it's on to the next shit\nWhen the car screeched off, I blast my heat off\nThus crackin' our winshield\nThat stud shoulda been killed\nKept shootin' 'till I seen his bloody body do a windmill\nStarted catchin' convulsions that we frozen\nAin't nobody here to hold it\nFeelin the escape was kinda golden\nNow we dozin'\nMore niggas have rolled in\nThey started comin' at us with high-tech shit\nIt's only so much one mac can do\nBut you know what we got to do\nDon't get in the wind\nIs it the end or chapter 2\nThey coming after you\n\n1 -

cannot see\nI hate you girl you know I lie\nI hate you girl you know I lie\n\n[Outro: Kaleena & Dawn Richard]\nCan't stand you baby please dont go\nI'd rather hate you, then see you out the door\nBaby, ain't no love left here for you\nIf that's what I'm telling you, I hate loving you\nI dont wanna, dont wanna be without you\nWhy not tell the truth?\nI hate loving you\nI don't wannna, dont wanna be without you\nI let you control my heart, baby but it went too far\nDon't go, don't go, don't want you I hate you\nDon't go, don't go, don't want you I hate you", "image":

getting high\nYou know without you I'mma die\nYou clip my wings now I can't fly\nMy momma told me never cry\nShe never taught me to say bye\nI cannot let you go, I tried\nI hate you girl you know I lie\nI hate you girl you know I lie\n\n[Verse 3: Dawn]\nBoy you're gonna have to use your senses\nJust to figure out the distance\nDifference, how you want to love me you choose\nExcept for why you're looking confused\nI gave you my sanity, I gave you a chance to leave\nTelling me I dont need you, I dont believe you\nCause I dont need nobody like you\n\n[Hook: Kaleena]\nDon't go, don't go, don't

motherfucking bitch to me\nYou just let me bleed\nYou just let me leave\nNow I cannot see\nCause when I cry, I cry tears of blood\nYou the one I love\nYou the one I love\nYou the one I trust\nAnd you say you can't fuck with me?\nI can't fuck with you\nWe can't fuck with we\nAnd we cannot see\nI hate you girl you know I lie\nI hate you girl you know I lie\n\n[Outro: Kaleena & Dawn Richard]\nCan't

Time to get freaky, freaky\nGet my Price cd, do me babyy\n(Kim, I think you're the one for me\nLet's get married so you can have a son for me.)\nNot now baby, stick your tongue in me\nMake me feel good, I might let you cum in me\nThe way you call me mommy, ooh I love it, [2]\nMake me wanna go public\nTell the whole world that I'm your girl\nTake pictures with our moms on the cover of New York Times\nGrew up bad, just like his mom and dad\nA real nigga is all I want, all I ever had\nThings you do, give a bitch to choose\nLike writing out \"I Love You\" in hundered dollar bills\nFeed each other fruits like kiwi and mango\nRock kangos, while we do the durango\nAnd when we fight, we both get bruised\nLie to everybody, say they matchin tattoos\nMy nigga got beef, ain't shit you can tell me\nI cut a nigga's throat like Shaquita from Bellarmy\nI wanna house in Africa, ??? in my back yard\nBusinesses surrounded by security guards\nWith a big ass club called \"Kim n Him\"\nAnd a crew

when you say you thuggin', it doesn't matter\nIt goes into my mind as just chit-chatter\nYou may say I have a ego, or just merry free\nBut none of that tough talk I take seriously\nIt goes in one ear and right out the other\nHeard that fake thug shit? brotha\nI don't mean to brag, never never hate\nYou ain't got the bank that it takes to stop this\nHa, ha, ha, ha sucker, you missed\nI put feelings aside, you know who I am\nP-U-2-F, keys to the U.S\nAnd I hate when one attempts to analyze\nFranchise, get your hands tied\nThrown over a boat, don't know what you was thinking\nThat dream is over, your body sinking\n\n[Redman]\nYo yo yo, yo yo yo, fucka\nYou thugs out there who don't got a clue\n(You have Brooklyn, ain't shoot the shit out)\nYo, fuck you, you and you, fuck you and you\n(You have Jersey, ain't shoot the shit out)\nHey yo bitch, you know what I want when I bring my crew\n(We go Uptown and shoot the shit out)\nYo, we want hardcore, smash the walls\nI stack, bring it back for y'all\nWith 40 nigga's after y'all\n\n[Puffy]\nWe got it ziplocked (that's right)\nEverybody hit the floor when the shit drop\nShit knocked, bitch stop (bitch, stop)\nWe roll, we ball, we all night long\nWe don't stop, nigga's thought the heat was gone\nBut I'm back to do it again, leader of rhyme\nBAD BOY, we turn it to the scene of the crime\nImmaculate fame, you can have that shit\nI just wanna 'gaitor slide with the baddest bitch\nModels and actresses that swallow bottles\nThat magnum shit\nGet nice as fuck, leave when the lights is up\nTear it down when the mics is up\nLately they say Diddy's gettin' nice as hell\nShit, if I don't write it I recite it well\nLocked the flow so tight you gotta know\nI'mma tumble 'fore they rock my dough\nMotherfuckers\n\n[Redman]\nYo yo yo, yo yo yo, fucka\nYou thugs out there, you don't got a clue\n(You have Boogie Down, don't shoot the shit out)\nYo, fuck you, you and you, fuck you and you\n(You got Shaolin, don't shoot the shit out)\nHey yo bitch, you know what I want when I bring my crew\n(You have QB, don't shoot the shit out)\nYo, you want hardcore, smash the walls\nI stack, bring it back for y'all\nWith 40 nigga's after y'all\n\n[Puffy]\nAiyyo ladies, get up\nBounce your tits up\nBe happy Brooklyn ain't shoot this shit up\nCause I see some ladies tonight\nThat I could give a condom or 3 babies tonight\nYou might catch a flight if you playing me right\nBut if you whack there you gettin cab fare\nYo, I'm all for drama, a little clap clap there\nI mean I ain't Ghandi of this whole rap gear\nBut you see honey that I'm rappin with there?\nAll I need is a minute to get her back to the Leer\nBack where it is, less traffic there\nWhere Cease is with a few of his pieces\nThat's how we is, we slide and divide\nIf she ain't with it, I-95\nHit the road tramp, and don't you come back no more\nNo more, no more, no more\n\n[Redman]\nYo yo yo, yo yo yo, fucka\nYou thugs out there, you don't got a clue\n(You got Def Squad, don't shoot the shit out)\nYo, fuck you, you and you, fuck you and you\n(You got Bad Boy, don't shoot the shit out)\nHey yo bitch, you know what I want when I bring my crew\n(We go Brick City, don't shoot the shit out)\nYo, you want hardcore, smash the walls\nI stack, bring it back for y'all\nWith 40 nigga's after y'all\n\nRepeat chorus until fade"}}, {"title":

over Foxx]\nCan I talk to you for a second?\nThere's some things I've been meanin to tell you\nSome things that have been on my mind\nListen to me baby (let's go)\n\n[Jamie] Girl, maybe we should think about it (think about it baby)\n[Diddy] Boo you know what? (What)\n\n[Diddy] + (girl)\nThe day when I first seen you\nYou know I didn't stand, but I ain't mean to (yes you did)\nBack then it wasn't oh so fair\nYou came through like some good clean air\nSkin softer than the softest fabrics\nYou heard about me (I heard about you)\nHow I ball like the Dallas Mavericks\nSayin, anything you want, you can have it (give it to me)\nThat's Harlem World, I get on my grizzly savage see?\nFrom the first day, we laid eyes on each other\nAt the office I knew we was gon' be lovers (I remember)\nMark hotel under the covers\nYou said I was cool and not like a lot of them brothers\nWho used and abused you and took you for granted\nSee you a Goddess, that's why you was put on this planet (I love you)\nSince you got me all sentimental\n\n[Hook] w/ Diddy ad libs\n\n[Diddy] C'mon, don't stop\n[Jamie] Girl, maybe we should think about it (think about it baby)\n\n[Diddy]\nYou're so amazin\nAll I can see is us now in the sun just grazin\nBoo your brown complexion, I never seen a\nSame color as coffee a teaspoon of creamer\n'Member when I had the Beemer? Remember?\nGoin through tough times and knowin the other side was greener\nWe had a dream, we pursued it\n'Member that conversation, all or nothin before we lose it?\nYou remember - it's all words like music\nCame at a time I needed soothin, soul body and mind\nAt times I felt violent, you kept me in line\nWhere-ever I went you wasn't far behind\nGirl, we got a bond no one can break\nAnd I'm sayin, I pray to God every night we make it - pray to God\nI'm hooked and I don't wanna shake you - c'mon\n\n[Hook] - faded into deep background\n\n[Diddy talks over Hook]\nYeah I've been doin a lot of thinkin lately baby, yeah\nNow I know I done put you through a lot of shit\nI know it's hard fuckin with a nigga like me\nYeah, you get a lot of respect for that shit\nRidin with a nigga\nYou know.. you might as well\n\n[Diddy]\nNow sit back and reflect, on all our accomplishments\nThe mansions, the plush apartments and\nThe big boats and the cases of whole klicko\nI don't ever wanna let you go\nIt's a certain kind of feelin, you know that feelin you get\nWhen your girl right and you know what's what, uhh\nYou got me on some lay low stuff\nYou stood by me, all through that J-Lo

it get worse and fall apart\nMaybe you should quit your job.. and do what's right\nAnd make you my partner for life\nSo we can chill (and have a little fun)\nSo we can chill (and have some little ones)\nSo we can chill (until our living's done)\n\n[Diddy - over Foxx]\nCan I talk to you for a second?\nThere's some things I've been meanin to tell you\nSome things that have been on my mind\nListen to me baby (let's go)\n\n[Jamie] Girl, maybe we should think about it (think about it baby)\n[Diddy] Boo you know what? (What)\n\n[Diddy] + (girl)\nThe day when I first seen you\nYou know I didn't stand, but I ain't mean to (yes you did)\nBack then it wasn't oh so fair\nYou came through like some good clean air\nSkin softer than the softest fabrics\nYou heard about me (I heard about you)\nHow I ball like the Dallas Mavericks\nSayin, anything you want, you can have it (give it to me)\nThat's Harlem World, I get on my grizzly savage see?\nFrom the first day, we laid eyes on each other\nAt the office I knew we was gon' be lovers (I remember)\nMark hotel under the covers\nYou said I was cool and not like a lot of them brothers\nWho used and abused you and took you for granted\nSee you a Goddess, that's why you was put on this planet (I love you)\nSince you got me all sentimental\n\n[Hook] w/ Diddy ad libs\n\n[Diddy] C'mon, don't stop\n[Jamie] Girl, maybe we should think about it (think about it baby)\n\n[Diddy]\nYou're so amazin\nAll I can see is us now in the sun just grazin\nBoo your brown complexion, I never seen a\nSame color as coffee a teaspoon of creamer\n'Member when I had the Beemer? Remember?\nGoin through tough times and knowin the other side was greener\nWe had a dream, we pursued it\n'Member that conversation, all or nothin before we lose it?\nYou remember - it's all words like music\nCame at a time I needed soothin, soul body and mind\nAt times I felt violent, you kept me in line\nWhere-ever I went you wasn't far behind\nGirl, we got a bond no one can break\nAnd I'm sayin, I pray to God every night we make it - pray to God\nI'm hooked and I don't wanna shake you - c'mon\n\n[Hook] - faded into deep background\n\n[Diddy talks over Hook]\nYeah I've been doin a lot of thinkin lately baby, yeah\nNow I know I done put you through a lot of shit\nI know it's hard fuckin with a nigga like me\nYeah, you get a lot of respect for that shit\nRidin with a nigga\nYou know.. you might as well\n\n[Diddy]\nNow sit back and reflect, on all our accomplishments\nThe mansions, the plush apartments and\nThe big boats and the cases of whole klicko\nI don't ever wanna let you go\nIt's a certain kind of feelin, you know that feelin you get\nWhen your girl right and you know what's what, uhh\nYou got me on some lay low stuff\nYou stood by me, all through that J-Lo stuff\nBrush your shoulders off girl, go 'head and brush 'em\nWithout you around, I can't function\nWe gon' be together 'til the day we die\nAnd when they put us in the ground we'll be side by side\nI never had a girl make me feel like you\nAnd every day I wake up, I feel brand new\nI live for you and I'll die for you too\nI love you girl\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Jamie Foxx]\nGirl, maybe we should think about it\nOh we could be down for life\nHave a couple kids and make you my wife, baby\nYou're beautiful lady\nMy beautiful, so wonderful\nI love you so..\n\nOh we could be down for life\nHave a couple kids and make you my wife, baby\nYou're beautiful lady\nBaby let's chill\nBaby let's chill\nBaby that's real forever {*fades out*}"}}, {"title": "All Night Long", "album": "Press Play", "year":

chronic\nAnd I move like a diplomat, hoodie and fitted caps\nDwell in the habitat where cons and killers at\nFaced a thousand deaths, cowards'll bow to the feet\nOf the almighty, a God to the black child\nI told moms I would be somethin\nI gave myself to the world now it's like you owe me somethin\nListen up, I got a story to tell\nIt's like I fell out of heaven just to walk through hell\nIt's what, fueled my fire, ignited my desire\nYou gave me the bricks and the sand to build the empire\nThrow the seal on my forehead, my faith still strong\nWith all I've been through, you would think my faith gone\nBut nope, I hold my stance in stone\nI move mountains with my will and succeed that's how I keep goin\nWon't stop been the motto, feelin rich like I won the lotto\nIt's almost like seein through the eyes of a crack child\nDodgin crisis, three strike system niggas trapped in a vice grip\nYou can't defeat me, I defy all odds and sabotages\nI survived Reagan, I survived the first Bush\nThinkin back when my moms gave that first push\nThank God for my life I came through the room\nUntil the evil of part two, when God gave me a sequel\nRags to royal, momma hand her hands in soil\nPops moved drugs in capsules and foils\nI foiled your plans and made you aware\nAnd turned America's dream into a nightmare\nYeah, you feel the vibe muh'fuckers\nThe first B.I., \"Ready to Die\" muh'fuckers\nSo \"Who Shot Ya,\" 9 to 5 muh'fuckers\n\"Bad Boy for Life,\" is I muh'fuckers\nAnd it's back, better than it ever was\nI'm talkin like we was gone but we never was\nSo I deliver the truth uncut\nWe produce more hits got the booth fucked up\nOn top of the statue yellin \"Who want what?\"\nFor the past ten years, the future is us\n(C'mon man) Eyes closed like I'm blowin reefer\nThe preview is over, now enjoy the future\nNiggas\n\nI wanna thank y'all for believin in me for so long\nThank y'all for ridin with a nigga\nAs we continue on!\nYou are now listenin to the sounds\nOf the

Brothers\nThugs actin funny cause chicks call me honey\nSee a 9 figure nigga makin Bugs Bunny money\nEons beyond bling bling\nSo I chose to get engaged to these sweet 16's\nMake a name, let it bang so beautiful\nThe theme music for crews that move pharmaceuticals\nOr, suitable for, a recuitable whore\nTo service the whole crew when we out on tour\nHold up, hold up, hold up, hold up\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Diddy]\nIt's like the music will literally stop time\n(Hold up hold up hold up)\nWe roll up, 20 deep, cock D swoll up\nGet inflicted by my verbal conviction\nA Bad Boy but far from a Detroit Piston\nYou're not focused enough, you're not listenin\nYou need to slow down, hold up like kickstand\nHop to it, get on your grind music\nAcross 110th sharp caesar with a lime music\nFine-tuned with the proper soul seasoning\nYour live shows are boring you're just not pleasin 'em\nStop teasin 'em you can't rock Palladium\nWe bring New York back like that West side stadium\nFuck the game and if the fame went away\nStill be the hardest workin man in entertainment today\nLearn a lesson in that, no questionin that\nNo guesswork involved so stop stressin the facts\nHold up\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9838b615ada8bf1cb8ebde2f834f419e.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Puff Daddy", "raw": {"annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/38141",

I need y'all to sing children\nSing, I like it when the children sing\nI like it when you sing; I like it when they sing man\nThat lets you know something's comin\nOh it's comin - aww man something's comin\nI like this sound of this - something's comin\n\nYou can picture like a photograph, envision the image\nOf one-two-fifth street and Lenox\nThe old folks their souls are cold like tenants\nTryin to keep your weight up better eat that spinach\nFor four twenty-five niggas lives get diminished\nThe world serious, I'm tryin to win a pennant\nCops be on patrol through the block every minute\nItchin just to pop somethin, swearin I'm a menace\nThey disturb me but it's love like tennis\nMan, cap to the side and my jersey is vintage\nChicks'll make a nigga dick hard like a Guinness\nDamn it's a scam but I handle my business\nPlan to be the man if the Lord be my witness\nDo my chin-ups\u200b with the walk sign for my physical fitness\n16's sicker than Alzheimer's, flows is ridiculous\nHold up\n\n[Hook: children sing]\nTold y'all really really y'all can't hold up\nTold y'all really really y'all can't hold up\nTold y'all really really y'all can't hold up\nHold up, hold up hold up hold up hold up\n\n[Diddy]\nEasy now I'm seein 'em, mind where you patrol\nFall back young'un, play your lane like a goal\nWhen his majesty speaks, speech defy gravity\nBluetooth nigga but I don't have any cavities\nDiddy got it wrapped like cocoons\nPop shit like needles through cow manure balloons\nI urge you to tell a friend, warn a brother\nAbout my splurges, merges with Warner Brothers\nThugs actin funny cause chicks call me honey\nSee a 9 figure nigga makin Bugs Bunny money\nEons beyond bling bling\nSo I chose to get engaged to these sweet 16's\nMake a name, let it bang so beautiful\nThe theme music for crews that move pharmaceuticals\nOr, suitable for, a recuitable whore\nTo service the whole crew when we out on tour\nHold up, hold up, hold up, hold up\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Diddy]\nIt's like the music will literally stop time\n(Hold up hold up hold up)\nWe roll up, 20 deep, cock D swoll up\nGet inflicted by my verbal conviction\nA Bad Boy but far from a Detroit Piston\nYou're not focused enough, you're not listenin\nYou need to slow down, hold up like kickstand\nHop to it, get on your grind music\nAcross 110th sharp caesar with a lime music\nFine-tuned with the proper soul seasoning\nYour live shows are boring you're just not pleasin 'em\nStop teasin 'em you can't rock Palladium\nWe bring New York back like that West side stadium\nFuck the game and if the fame went away\nStill be the hardest workin man in entertainment today\nLearn a lesson in that, no questionin that\nNo guesswork involved so stop stressin the facts\nHold up\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "And We", "album": "Barbershop", "year": null, "lyrics": "[Intro: P.
