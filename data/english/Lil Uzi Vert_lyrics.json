right\n8\u2026 (yeah)\nCountin' them bands\nAll way to the top 'til they be fallin' over\n(Yeah, yeah, yeah)\nCountin' them bands\nOn my way to the top 'til we fallin' over\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't really care if you cry\nOn the real, you shoulda never lied\nShoulda saw the way she looked me in my eyes\nShe said, \"Baby, I am not afraid to die\"\nPush me to the edge\nAll my friends are dead\nPush me to the edge\nAll my friends are dead\nPush me to the edge\nAll my friends are dead\nPush me to the edge\n\n[Verse 1]\nPhantom that's all red, inside all white\nLike somethin' you ride a sled down, I just want that head\nMy Brittany got mad, I'm barely her man now\nEverybody got the same swag now\nWatch the way that I tear it down\nStackin' my bands all the way to the top\nAll the way 'til my bands fallin' over\nEvery time that you leave your spot\nYour girlfriend call me like, \"Come on over!\"\nI like the way that she treat me\nGon' leave you, won't leave me, I call it that Casanova\nShe say I'm insane, yeah\nI might blow my brain out (hey)\nXanny, help the pain, yeah\nPlease, Xanny, make it go away\nI'm committed, not addicted, but it keep control of me\nAll the pain, now I can't feel it\nI swear that it's slowin' me, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't really care if you cry\nOn the real, you shoulda never lied\nSaw the way she looked me in my eyes\nShe said: \"I am not afraid to die.\"\nAll my friends are dead\nPush me to the edge (yeah)\nAll my friends are dead, yeah, ooh\nPush me to the edge\nAll my friends are dead, yeah\nAll my friends are dead, yeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nThat is not your swag, I swear you fake hard\nNow these niggas wanna take my cadence\nRain on 'em, thunderstorm, rain on 'em (ooh, yeah)\nMedicine, lil' nigga, take some (yeh, yeh)\nFast car, NASCAR, race on 'em\nIn the club, ain't got no ones, then we would beg them\nClothes from overseas, got the racks and they all C-Notes\nYou is not a G though\nLookin' at you stackin' all your money, it all green though\nI was countin' that and these all twenties, that's a G-roll\n\n[Bridge]\nShe say: \"You're the worst, you're the worst.\"\nI cannot die because this my universe\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't really care if you cry\nOn the real, you shoulda never lied\nShoulda saw the way she looked me in my eyes\nShe said: \"Baby, I am not afraid to die.\"\nPush me to the edge\nAll my friends are dead\nPush me

trying to show you things\nIced out heart on your neck trying to froze your ring\nI had to get me a new bitch to hold the pain\nWe was in Hawaii looking at the rain\nShe smiling happy but I'm laughing 'cause her new man a lame\n(Broke boi, broke boi, broke boi, broke boi)\nThat just goes to show me money don't attract a thing (real shit)\nStuck to the plan even though you used to go with my

swear it gets her wetter\nMy Louboutins new, so my bottoms, they is redder\nNo I'm not a rat but I'm all about my cheddar\nJust talked to your homie she said we should be together\nGave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header\nIf she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her\nBut I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her\nHello I was listening to this song\nIt goes like\n\n[Chorus]\nI know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it\nYou'll find another life to live\nI swear that you'll get over it\nI know you're sad and tired\nYou've got nothing left to give\nYou'll find another life to live\nI know that you'll get over it\n\n[Verse 1]\nWish I never ever ever told you things\nI was only only trying to show you things\nIced out heart on your neck trying to froze your ring\nI had to get me a new bitch to hold the pain\nWe was in Hawaii looking at the rain\nShe smiling happy but I'm laughing 'cause her new man a lame\n(Broke boi, broke boi, broke boi, broke boi)\nThat just goes to show me money don't attract a thing (real shit)\nStuck to the plan even though you used to go with my mans\nOh get over it\n\n[Chorus]\nI know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it\nYou'll find another life to live\nI swear that you'll get over it\nI know you're sad and tired\nYou've got nothing left to give\nYou'll find another life to live\nI know that you'll get over it\n\n[Verse 2]\nI tied up my RAF you strapped up your Rick\nDiamonds on your neck, ice all on my wrist\nComplement my style\nShe don't want me I'm running wild\nYou know I respect her on that level\nShe don't want me then I'ma let her\nGo over there with that broke fella\nWalk off my Saint Laurent, that leather\nMy new chick I swear that she better\nWant me back, never (ooh)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThat's true, that's right\nShe's sipping Moet, and yeah I swear it gets her wetter\nMy Louboutins new, so my bottoms, they is redder\nNo I'm not a rat but I'm all about my cheddar\nJust talked to your homie she said we should be together\nGave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header\nIf she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her\nBut I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her\n\n[Chorus: Oh Wonder & Lil Uzi Vert]\nI know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it (woah)\nYou'll find another life to live\nI swear that you'll get over it (you'll get over it)\nI know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it (no,no)\nYou'll find another life to live (you will)\nI know that you'll get over it (oh)\n\n[Outro: Oh Wonder & Lil Uzi Vert]\nYou'll

(Ay)\nI got some lights on my chest (Yuh)\nDon't confuse it with a heart (Mhm)\nHeard things ain't looking too good for you\nHad to pull some strings like I play the harp\nI get these billions

In 2017, a theory that Uzi was associated with Satan gained traction online, citing evidence such as the similarity between \u201cLucifer\u201d and \u201cLil Uzi Vert.\u201d Uzi also wears an inverted cross, or the Cross of Saint Peter, as part of a necklace. Even though the symbol has its roots as a Christian symbol, it is also used to express anti-Christian sentiment and is popular in punk rock, a genre that Uzi draws inspiration from.\n\n\n\nThis song

In 2017, a theory that Uzi was associated with Satan gained traction online, citing evidence such as the similarity between \u201cLucifer\u201d and \u201cLil Uzi Vert.\u201d Uzi also wears an inverted cross, or the Cross of Saint Peter, as part of a necklace. Even though the symbol has its roots as a Christian symbol, it is also used to express anti-Christian sentiment and is popular in punk rock, a genre that Uzi draws inspiration from.\n\n\n\nThis song

a five-star room in Hell\nWait, cause they not loyal\nCan't believe we grew up in the soil\n(fuck nigga, fuck nigga, fuck nigga!)\nTell my niggas I got them with lawyers\nMan, I wish I would knew I

On the track he discusses the fact that he now has money and power in the music industry. The song explains how \u201cSoundCloud rappers\u201d are biting his style and stealing his cadence to attempt to ride the wave for fame. The song also talks about how people should be thanking him for innovating the hip-hop industry because he feels like a lot of people wouldn\u2019t be popping right now if it wasn\u2019t for him and

no\nI can't feel no more\nI told myself that I wasn't gonna pop no pills no more\nNo, I can't feel no more\nI can't...\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't feel, no\nI can't feel, I can't feel\nI can't feel\nMy body's numb\nBaby because I am so hurt\nI feel the pain in the rain\nTell me, what\u2019s my time and worth?\nNot my first merry-go-round\nNot my first merry-go-round, yeah\nLiving life just with a curse, before I go in a hearse\nTold you that I love you first\nTold you that I love you first, ooh\nNow a days I gotta swerve you\nI took you out of those fur boots\n\n[Verse 1]\nBack then I saw no one but you\nGave you my racks and I splurged too\nCalling my phone and I curved you\nHope this song really don't hurt you\nAP froze, time so slow, yeah, hit reverse\nMargiela all on my coat\nGot buttons, but leaving it open\nSo they can all see my shirt, Rick Owens all on my shirt\nI can't believe I made it out the dirt\nThat was back then when my pockets was hurt\nPockets so stuffed that them shits still be hurtin\u2019\nWalk with the Goyard, they say its a purse\nLouis scarf on me it look like a curtain\nMy main girl a doctor, my side girl a nurse\nThey keep on talkin' (woah)\nThey keep on talkin' (they hatin)\nAll these girls up in the club, why you lookin' at Vert?\nI am not worried because when my niggas come\nThey gonna need a white curtain\nYour boyfriend hate my \"Bad And Boujee\" verse\nShe gave me head so I called her a nerd\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't feel, no\nI can't feel, I can't feel\nI can't feel\nMy body's numb\nBaby because I am so hurt\nI feel the pain in the rain\nTell me, what's my time and worth?\nNot my first merry-go-round\nNot my first merry-go-round yeah\nLiving life just with a curse\nBefore I go in a hearse\nTold you that I love you first\nTold you that I love you first, oo\nNow a days I gotta swerve you\nI took you out of the fur boots\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm doing fine now, I'm doing fine now\nNo I do not need nobody now\nNo I do not need nobody now\nNo girl don't make a sound\nYou don't wanna argue about body count\nYou don't wanna talk about body count\nYou don't wanna talk about body count\nWhat is all this fighting all about\nIt's the bodies that I'm finding out\nIt's the bodies I don't know about\nSo many bodies like a murder trial\nYou used to say that it's word of mouth\nBut I love you so you're bondin' out\nBut I love you so you're bondin' out\nGrandma and Mom love you now\nI'm so high I ain't comin' down\nI'm so high I ain't comin' down\nI'm so high I ain't comin' down\nHate me then, but they love me now\nLove me then, but they hate me now\nIt don't matter, got the paper now\nI'm so numb\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't feel, no\nI can't feel, I can't feel\nI can't feel, my body's numb\nBaby because I am so hurt\nI feel the pain in the rain\nTell me, what's my time and worth?\nNot my first merry-go-round\nNot my first merry-go-round yeah\nLiving life just with a curse\nBefore I go in a hearse\nTold you that I love you

diamonds than your jeweler\nAll my girls dress like they work at Hooters\nFirst I get my racks and then I backpack\nNo, I don't subtract, I might just add that\nDid it on my own, no, you can't tax that\nThis that under the table, you can't track that\n\n[Bridge]\nPut money ahead and I move with the bread\nBut I do not need a toaster\nDiamond, water, I'm the boatster\nPull up right there in the

outside gave her out cum\nBy any means just like Malcolm\nLive by any means just like Malcolm\nI be outside all the way from the morning to dark\nAll these diamonds in my teeth, yeah I barely can talk\nI be balling like I am Derrick Rose\nKilling my competition like I'm Rogue\nLuv is rage I'm in the crowd at my shows\n\n[Hook: Lil Uzi]\nI just want all of my niggas to ball\nI just want all of my niggas to see, all the shit that I might not get to see\nI just want all of my niggas to eat, I might just pull out that lean\nThat's a four\nI might just jump in a Rari with two doors, I might just pull up and fuck on two hoes\nI might just pull up and stunt like a boss\nI spent seven thousand right on the coat\nOn the real I don't know how to spell broke\nIf she talk too much I put dick in her throat\nI be balling like I am Derrick Rose\nKilling my competition like I'm Rogue\nLuv is rage I'm in the crowd at my shows\n\n[Verse 2: Lil Uzi]\nCounting money till I'm blue in the face\nCounting money and they blue in the face, I fucked that bitch till she blue in the face\nWearing Balmain, extra skinny, skinny, skinny all the way till I'm blue in the waist\nMixing lean, everywhere soda\nUnlike my heart, my cup way colder, xanny bars got me way bolder\nI just be counting the bank, I ball like I am Durant\nYour bitch I swear she a fan, I put that money on you yeah\nLittle nigga you will get fanned, living life like I'm a rock star\nI do this shit for my fans, my brother he is a block star\nHe amazing with the pans\n\n[Hook: Lil Uzi]\nI just want all of my niggas to ball\nI just want all of my niggas to see, all the shit that I might not get to see\nI just want all of my niggas to eat, I might just pull out that lean, that's a four\nI might just jump in a Rari with two doors, I might just pull up and fuck on two hoes\nI might just pull up and stunt like a boss\nI spent seven thousand right on the coat\nOn the real I don't know how to spell broke\nIf she talk too much I put dick in her throat\nI be balling like I am Derrick Rose\nKilling my competition like I'm Rogue\nLuv is rage I'm in the crowd at my shows\n\n[Verse 3: Lil Uzi]\nPaid a lot of money for this ice\nOn the real I think I found my wife\nAlways in my hair just like some lice, when I miss a call you know I hit her twice\nPut it on my life, higher than a kite\nLiving life like I can't die, they live for me and that's the reason why\n\n[Hook: Lil Uzi]\nI just want all of my niggas to ball\nI just want all of my niggas to see, all the shit that I might not get to see\nI just want all of my niggas to eat, I might just pull out that lean\nAnd just fall\nI might just jump in a Rari with two doors, I might just pull up and fuck on two hoes\nI might just pull up and stunt like a boss\nI spent seven thousand right on the coat\nOn the real I don't know how to spell broke\nIf she talk too much I put dick in her throat\nI be balling like I am Derrick Rose\nKilling my

drama\nThat shit tastes like Cotton Candy\nKiesha put dick in her belly\nKianna never wear no panties\nI beat it, I feel like I'm Danny\nI'm skirting out in the White Rovers\nYou driving Toyota Corollas\nThe Bentley, it's system, no solar\nMy bitch's skin look like it's mocha\nI pull out my dick and I poke her\nMy gun, I swear, ain't got no holster\nI hit yo' ass right with the toaster\nWe bout it, bout it like Magnolia\nIf you walk fast, my gun will slow ya'\nI tear a hole in you like donuts\nI'm whippin' that white like the Jonas'\nI'm fuckin' yo' bitch for the bonus\nPlease show me, um, my opponent\nI'm likin' the way that I'm flowin'\nYou look at my chain, now it's snowin'\nSnakes all in the grass, get to mowin'\nExtendo on gun and then I get to blowin'\n\n[Hook]\nI'm from the

I'm all about\nShe said \"Who the fuck is Kianna?\", aye\nI said \"It's only you, Keisha\", aye\nThen it's my dick what I feed her\nKeisha my main\nGot Kianna on the side, Like Chicken Caesar\nI swerve in the Range\nAll my whips, I got work and I use an egg beater\nDress up like I'm homeless\nI'm gon' walk up to your whip and watch you lose your brain\nBeen in this game\nI might go to Africa,

the pain, all these girls are psycho\nRocking my suit like a mobster, rocking my suit like a model\nNone of these girls are my problem, none of these girls are my problem\nCall that girl, suck, chew, and swallow, call that girl, suck, chew, and swallow\nNumb from the pain 'cause I'm honest, only worried bout them dollar\n\n[Chorus]\nHey, I done got numb from the pain\nAll of these girls the

psycho\nDrivin' in the Lamb, swerving round the potholes\nKnow I got my gun everywhere that I go\nTatted up my face, I look like a psycho\nShe think she in love, but just want my dough\nI'm numb from the pain, all these girls are psycho\nRocking my suit like a mobster, rocking my suit like a model\nNone of these girls are my problem, none of these girls are my problem\nCall that girl, suck, chew, and swallow, call that girl, suck, chew, and swallow\nNumb from the pain 'cause I'm honest, only worried bout them dollar\n\n[Chorus]\nHey, I done got numb from the pain\nAll of these girls the same\nWho's the one to blame?\nNowadays, you not the same\nI flood my wrist out today\nI hit your girl in my Wraith\nI hit your girl in my Wraith\nIn a spaceship, outer space\nGeeking on Mars yesterday\nNow I'm on Pluto today\nI look the moon in its face\nI look the moon in its face\nMe and the moon relate\nMe and the moon relate\nMe and the moon relate\nMe and the moon relate\n\n[Verse 2]\nI gotta stack up my cake\nGetting them chips like it's Lay's\nMan, my donuts like it's glazed\nMan, my donuts like it's glazed\nYou know she told me you lame\nMe and you, boy, not the same\nDon't give a fuck what you bang\n1600 what I claim\n\n[Interlude]\nBah\nDoot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot\n\n[Verse 3]\nMy niggas aim at the brain\nNowadays, these niggas do anything just for the fame\nYou got a stick, I got a chopper\nThese bitches don't hit the same\nDon't hit the same, like, boy, you not the same\nWhat is you saying?\nTurned to a fool with the K\nTurned to a fool with the K\nGet that girl out of my face\n'Rari so fast, we race\n\n[Chorus]\nHey, I done got numb from the pain\nAll of these girls the same\nWho's the one to blame?\nNowadays, you not the same\nI flood my wrist out today\nI hit your girl in my Wraith\nI hit your girl in my Wraith\nIn a spaceship, outer space\nGeeking on Mars yesterday\nNow I'm on Pluto today\nI look the moon in its face\nI look the moon in its face\nMe and the moon relate\nMe and the moon relate\nMe and the moon relate\nMe and

dick, I be like \"wooh!\"\nIf I'm counting more than a thousand dollars I be like \"wooh!\"\nCount them rollz! Damn!\n\n[Verse]\nThe Audi on wrist and the Audi my whip\nAnd the R8 ain't come with a ceiling (skrt)\nTec-9 what I grip, and it got cooling kit and the clip, that bitch got a extension (brr)\nThe laser on it, a fuck nigga better be quick cause I swear to god I'm not missin'\nI probably won't miss, I put a bullet in your head\nAnd change your whole image (I'll kill you)\nI just talked to Wiz, I told Addie \"call me\"\nAin't talk to my guy in a minute (waddup addy)\nI went to the party, the bitches all on me\nI'm pullin' Brazilian and Remy (suck my dick)\nIf it bout the Benjis, don't play my Benjis\nBustin' at you with the semi\nI 'member when we was fuckin' a shawty in the basement\nHer name *beep*\nMy style doin' damage, diamonds they dancin'\nHair on her neck it be standin'\nMy pistols be twins, they clip be five-ten\nIt kinda remind me of Shannon\nBut I can not worry 'bout Shannon\nMy niggas eatin', you look famished\nI'm drinkin' that lean and I'm xannin'\nLil Uzi gon' be just richer than them\nThat's word to my nigga Don Cannon\nTalkin' that shit then I blam 'em\nWait, that nigga be runnin'\nI mean the plural, that nigga rannin'\nI got a bitch all on me, yes she be chewin' my dick up\nI be just killin' this shit\nWhen she eatin' the nut, it be givin' her hiccups\nYou should have worked out, shoot you in your stomach\nMuthafucka should've did sit-ups\nI don't give a fuck muthafucka, now you talkin', nigga, get up\nI been gettin' money, how bout you?\nYour bitch all on me, how bout you?\nHow that's your bitch, she suckin' my dick once again\nNow she talkin' 'bout you\nI told that bitch eat me, I'm killin' it\nI told that nigga I be fillin' it\nMan Lil Uzi, Lil Uzi, Lil Uzi that nigga on top of Philly like literally\nI don't give a fuck lil' nigga, I swear to god I hope that you die\nThey say \"why you dye your hair pink?\"\nNigga, I don't know, them xans got me too high\nI told that bitch I just be doin' it\nAin't understand me, don't give a fuck\nHit a nigga with a twenty shot\nTwenty shot right to his chin like a uppercut\nLil Uzi he just be stupid, told your bitch that I am ruthless\nShe suckin' my dick and she suckin' my dick\nAnd it feel like that bitch she is toothless\nWooh!\n\n[Bridge]\n(take a break count this god damn money, shitt)\nCount them rolls, count them rolls, count them rolls\nCount them rolls, count them rolls, count them rolls\nCount them rolls, count them rolls\n\n[Verse 2]\nJust talked to my plug, yeah\nHe got that Actavis just for him like by check\nAnd you the type nigga that be on the block\nStill tryna sip on that Hi-Tech\nI don't give a fuck nigga, what the fuck\nI might just hit your right up\nI told that bitch \"suck me up, suck me up, suck me up\"\nNo, no, no, I don't want to fuck\nLil Uzi crazy, Lil Uzi crazy, I did this shit in a day day\nI'm gettin' Nachos, movin' that work\nI ain't talkin' bout the libre\nI'm not with that he say, she say\nNot with the he say, she say\nI take his main and his side-bitch\nAnd we proceed right to the three-way, damn!\n\n[Outro]\nCount them rolls, count them rolls, count them rolls\nCount them rolls, count them rolls, count them rolls\nCount them rolls, count them rolls, count them rolls\nCount them rolls, count them rolls, count them rolls\nCount them rolls, count them rolls, count them rolls\nCount them rolls, count them rolls\nCount them rolls, Uzi Gang, count them rolls\nCount them rolls, Uzi Gang, count them rolls\nCount them rolls, Uzi Gang, count them rolls\nCount them rolls, Uzi Gang, count them rolls\nCount them rolls, Uzi Gang, count them

the guap 'til I'm getting blisters\nI say what I want, don't hold my tongue when I'm off the liquor\nDon't care what she did, still go out and get her\nCause I'm on a mission\nThey say she did this, say she did that\nBut I'm still gonna kiss her\nNo no no, I don't care who just had her\nCause I'm gonna get her\nNo no no, I am not worried 'bout that\nCause I wanna get her\nI do not care what she did, no, cause I'm gonna kiss her\nNo no no, I am not worried 'bout that\nCause I'm gonna get her\n\n[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]\nCharge her to the game, I am no beginner\nPut her on my gram, yea I'm posting pictures\nGirl I'm just saying I'll post up with ya'\nGirl I'm just saying let me post up with ya'\nI don't know if you sip drank, let me pour up with ya'\nAnd we both do the same thing, let me tour with ya'\nGirl you match my fly, that\u2019s the perfect image\nAnd I ain't gon' lie, no, I'm gonna get ya'\nI ain't worried 'bout who got you right now\nCause I'm getting to the guap, like right now\nCartier on a yacht, private island\nChanel, show the top, shawty stylin'\n\n[Hook: Lil Uzi Vert]\nCountin' the money\nCountin' the guap 'til I'm getting blisters\nI say what I want, don't

don't care who just had her\nCause I'm gonna get her\nNo no no, I am not worried 'bout that\nCause I wanna get her\nI do not care what she did, no, cause I'm gonna kiss her\nNo no no, I am not worried 'bout that\nCause I'm gonna get her\n\n[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]\nCum in a bitch and I go crazy\nSpend all these racks and I go crazy\nLeave out the parking lot doin' a 180\nThis how the lord made me\nDrop the top and start sun bathing\nPut her on a treadmill and then I make her run naked\nGot all my side hoes frustrated\nThis the life I waited on\nSeen a bitch from school, gave her number to a payphone\nI don't know what you been waiting on\nAll that I know is that I been waiting long\nI ain't waiting to get no lone\nProvolone on top of provolone\nMobile phone on top of mobile phone\nI don't know what you niggas smokin' on\nPull my closet got a upstairs\nMobile home on top of mobile home\nI go to sleep with a rollie on\nI start my car with remote control\nGet so much pussy\nI go to sleep with a condom on\n\n[Hook: Lil Uzi Vert]\nCountin' the money\nCountin' the guap 'til I'm getting blisters\nI say what I want, don't hold my tongue when I'm off the liquor\nDon't care if she

Khalifa]\nFuck I'm the king of the city\nI don't take a trip unless I got a bitch with me\nI pull up wit pounds or I got a zip in me\nYou don't want no problems, my guys so don't tempt me\nMy niggas go bap bap bap bap till it's empty\nFuck 2 every night in 5 days that's a 10 piece\nMy bitch that I'm with that's a 10 piece\nI\u2019m pourin' that gin in a simply\nYou niggas so fake need assembly\nI'm smokin' weed, fuck the penalty\nRidin' round in a old school, with 2 hoes and just little old me\nFuck I'ma do wit this money\nBut walk in the club and start stuntin'\nPush all my old bitches buttons\nCame up from nothin' to something\nTell her take the stick, don't run from me\nThere's some for you, there's some for me\nSo if we have this 3 some, make sure you cum for me\nAll that
