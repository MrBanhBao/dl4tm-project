Pfft, picture that\n\n[Hook]\nAin't no half-steppin'\nI'm the Big Daddy Kane\nAin't no half-steppin'\nI'm the Big Daddy Kane\nAin't no half-steppin'\nI'm the Big Daddy Kane\nMister Cee, step to me\n\n[Verse 4]\nThe name is Big Daddy, you know, as in, your father\nSo when you hear a def rhyme, believe that I'm the author\nI grab the mic and make emcees evaporate\nThe party people say, 'Damn, that rapper's great'\nThe creator, conductor of poetry\nEt cetera, et cetera, it ain't easy being me\nI speak clearly so you can understand\nPut words together like Letter Man\nNow that's dictation, proceeding to my innovation\nNot like the other emcees that are an imitation\nOr an animation, a cartoon to me\nBut when I'm finished, I'm sure that you are soon to see\nReality, my secret technique\nBecause I always speak with mentality\nI put my title in your face, dare you to base\nAnd if you try and come get it, yo I'ma show you who's with it\nSo if you know like I know, instead of messing around\nPlay like Roy Rogers and slow down\nJust give yourself a break, or someone else will take\nYour title, namely me, cause I'm homicidal\nThat means murder, cause I'm about to hurt a-\nNother emcee, that try to get with me\nI'll just break him and bake him and rake him\nAnd take him and mold him and make him\nHold up the peace sign, as salaam alaikum!", "image":

just gonna sit here laid back to this nice mellow beat, you know\nAnd drop some smooth lyrics cause '88\nTime to set it straight, know what I'm saying?\nAnd ain't no half stepping\nWord, I'm ready\n\n[Verse 1]\nRappers stepping to me, they want to get some\nBut I'm the Kane, so yo, you know the outcome\nAnother victory, they can't get with me\nSo pick a B.C. date cause you are history\nI'm the authentic poet to get lyrical\nFor you to beat me, it's gonna take a miracle\nAnd stepping to me, yo that's the wrong move\nSo what you on, Hobbs, dope or dog food?\nCompetition, I just devour\nLike a pit bull against a Chihuahua\nCause when it comes to being dope, hot damn\nI got it good, now let me tell you who I am\nThe B-I-G D-A-double-D-Y K-A-N-E\nDramatic, Asiatic, not like many\nI'm different, so don't compare me to another\nCause they can't hang, word to the mother\nAt least not with the principal in this pedigree\nSo when I roll on you rappers, you better be\nReady to die because you're petty\nYou're just a butter knife, I'm a machete\nThat's made by Ginsu, wait until when you\nTry to front, so I can chop into\nYour body, just because you try to be basing\nFriday the 13th, I'ma play Jason\nNo type of joke, gag, game, puzzle or riddle\nThe name is Big Daddy, yes, Big\u2014not little\nSo define it, here's your walking papers, sign it\nAnd take a walk as the Kane start to talk, cause\n\n[Hook]\nAin't no half-steppin'\nI'm the Big Daddy Kane\nAin't no half-steppin'\nI'm the Big Daddy Kane\nAin't no half-steppin'\nI'm the Big Daddy Kane\n\"Down the road\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy rhymes are so dope and the rappers be hoping\nTo sound like me, so soon I'll have to open\nA school of emceeing, for those who want to be in\nMy field in court, then again on second thought\nTo have emcees coming out sounding so similar\nIt's quite confusing for you to remember\nThe originator, and boy do I hate a\nPerpetrator, but I'm much greater\nThe best, oh yes, I guess suggest the rest should fess\nDon't mess or test your highness\nUnless you just address with best finesse\nAnd bless the paragraph I manifest\nRap prime minister, some say sinister\nNon-stopping the groove, until when it's the\nClimax, and I max, relax and chill\nHave a break from a take of me acting ill\nBrain cells are lit, ideas start to hit\nNext the formation of words that fit\nAt the table I sit, making it legit\nAnd when my pen hits the paper, ah shit\nI stop and stand strong over emcees\nAnd devour with the power of Hercules\nOr Samson, but I go further the length\nCause you could scalp my Cameo and I'll still have strength\nAnd no, that's not a myth, and if you try to riff\nOr get with, the man with the given gift of gab\nYour vocab, I'll only ignore\nBe sleeping on your rhymes till I start to snore\nYou can't awake me, or even make me\nFear you, son, cause you can't do me none\nSo, think about it if you're trying to go\nWhen you want to step to me, I think you should know that\n\n[Hook]\nAin't no half-steppin'\nI'm the Big Daddy Kane\nAin't no half-steppin'\nI'm the Big Daddy Kane\nAin't no half-steppin'\nI'm the Big Daddy Kane\n\"Down the road\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nI appear right here and scare and dare\nA mere musketeer that would dare to compare\nPut him in the rear, back there where he can't see clear\nGet a beer, idea or near stare, yeah\nSo on to be want to be competition\nTrying to step to me, must be on a mission\nUp on the stage is where I'ma get you at\nYou think I'm losing? Pfft, picture that\n\n[Hook]\nAin't no half-steppin'\nI'm the Big Daddy Kane\nAin't no half-steppin'\nI'm the Big Daddy Kane\nAin't no half-steppin'\nI'm the Big Daddy Kane\nMister Cee, step to me\n\n[Verse 4]\nThe name is Big Daddy, you know, as in, your father\nSo when you hear a def rhyme, believe that I'm the author\nI grab the mic and make emcees evaporate\nThe party people say, 'Damn, that rapper's great'\nThe creator, conductor of poetry\nEt cetera, et cetera, it ain't easy being me\nI speak clearly so you can understand\nPut words together like Letter Man\nNow that's dictation, proceeding to my innovation\nNot like the other emcees that are an imitation\nOr an animation, a cartoon to me\nBut when I'm finished, I'm sure that you are soon to see\nReality, my secret technique\nBecause I always speak with mentality\nI put my title in your face, dare you to base\nAnd if you try and come get it, yo I'ma show you who's with it\nSo if you know like I know, instead of messing around\nPlay like Roy Rogers and slow down\nJust give yourself a break, or someone else will take\nYour title, namely me, cause I'm homicidal\nThat means murder, cause I'm about to hurt a-\nNother emcee, that try to get with me\nI'll just break him and bake him and rake him\nAnd take him and mold him and make him\nHold up the peace sign, as salaam alaikum!"}}, {"title": "Smooth Operator", "album": "It's a Big Daddy Thing", "year": "1989-09-19", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWell excuse me, take a few minutes, to mellow out\nBig Daddy Kane is on the mic and I'mma tell about\nA minimum length, of rhymes of strength\nAnd power, so listen to the man of the hour\nFlow and go to a slow tempo and you know\nSing ho, swing low, then yo the show\nWill go on, as I perform\nTransformin on stage like a Decepticon\nBut I'm not animated like a cartoon\nI'm for real, shootin lyrics like a harpoon\nAcross the crowd, the listeners, the spectators\nSo let's groove with the smooth operator\n\n[Hook]\n\"Cause I'm so smooth...\"\n\nThe B-I-G, D-A-double-D-Y-K-A-N-E\nI'm good and plenty, servin many and any\nCompetition, wishin' for an expedition\nI'm straight up dissin' and dismissin', listen\nRappers act so wild, and love to profile\nFrontin hard but ain't got no style\nI give nightmares to those who compete\nFreddy Kreuger, walkin' on Kane Street\nConfuse and lose abuse and bruise the crews\nWho choose to use my name wrong, they pay dues\nDestruction from the exterminator\nBut in a calm manner, cause I'm a smooth operator\n\n[Hook]\n\"Cause I'm so smooth...\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow girls step up to this\nOne simple kiss, and it's over, Miss\nSold to nice dreamers, high as the price seem\nGirlfriend, you been scooped like ice cream\nSo just swing or fling a gathering, try to cling\nCause It's a Big Daddy Thing\nAnd I'm lovin em right, word is bond\nSo just play Marvin Gaye and Let's Get It On\nI make it real good like Dr. Feelgood\nTo make sure that my point is understood\nThat when it comes to this there's none greater\nSincerely yours... the smooth operator\n\n[Hook]\n\"Cause I'm so smooth...\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow ain't that the pot callin' the kettle black\nSayin' I'm a new jack, you need to be smacked\nThe smooth way I say 'em and the way I display 'em\nTo make them sound different in a way that's gifted\nAnd hey I'm, makin sure every lyric is done fine\nAnd I make one line, bright as the sunshine\nAttack you like Robitussin on a cough\nIf you know like I know -- step off\nCompetition, I'mma get rid of\nYou can't get a bit of, so just consider\nA break or rest, vacation, hibernation\nAnd make way for my smooth operation\nI'm a smooth operator\n\n[Hook]\n\"Cause I'm so smooth...\"\n\nAhhhhh yeahhh, and you don't stop\nGenuine for '89\nAnd I still ain't half-steppin, peace!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/500600ed1b30fe8b9226fcf832379981.600x597x1.jpg", "artist": "Big Daddy Kane", "raw": {"annotation_count": 14, "api_path": "/songs/10152", "apple_music_id": "442168275", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/10152/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "From the album/CD \u201cIt\u2019s a Big Daddy Thing,\u201d this classic Kane track uses the bass line from Mary Jane Girls\u2018 \u201cAll Night Long\u201d to lay down a funky, mellow groove that suits the titular character perfectly.\n\n\u201cSmooth Operator\u201d is also a furthering of the competition between Kane and fellow NYC rapper Rakim.

cartoon\nI'm for real, shootin lyrics like a harpoon\nAcross the crowd, the listeners, the spectators\nSo let's groove with the smooth operator\n\n[Hook]\n\"Cause I'm so smooth...\"\n\nThe B-I-G, D-A-double-D-Y-K-A-N-E\nI'm good and plenty, servin many and any\nCompetition, wishin' for an expedition\nI'm straight up dissin' and dismissin', listen\nRappers act so wild, and love to profile\nFrontin hard but ain't got no style\nI give nightmares to those who compete\nFreddy Kreuger, walkin' on Kane Street\nConfuse and lose abuse and bruise the crews\nWho choose to use my name wrong, they pay dues\nDestruction from the exterminator\nBut in a calm manner, cause I'm a smooth operator\n\n[Hook]\n\"Cause I'm so smooth...\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow girls step up to this\nOne simple kiss, and it's over, Miss\nSold to nice dreamers, high as the price seem\nGirlfriend, you been scooped like ice cream\nSo just swing or fling a gathering, try to cling\nCause It's a Big Daddy Thing\nAnd I'm lovin em right, word is bond\nSo just play Marvin Gaye and Let's Get It On\nI make it real good like Dr. Feelgood\nTo make sure that my point is understood\nThat when it comes to this there's none greater\nSincerely yours... the smooth operator\n\n[Hook]\n\"Cause I'm so smooth...\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow ain't that the pot callin' the kettle black\nSayin' I'm a new jack, you need to be smacked\nThe smooth way I say 'em and the way I display 'em\nTo make them sound different in a way that's gifted\nAnd hey I'm, makin sure every lyric is done fine\nAnd I make one line, bright as the sunshine\nAttack you like Robitussin on a cough\nIf you know like I know -- step off\nCompetition, I'mma get rid of\nYou can't get a bit of, so just consider\nA break or rest, vacation, hibernation\nAnd make way for my smooth operation\nI'm a smooth operator\n\n[Hook]\n\"Cause I'm so smooth...\"\n\nAhhhhh yeahhh, and you don't stop\nGenuine for '89\nAnd I still ain't half-steppin,

accompanied by staccato human tones\nIt has been his aim to add breadth and depth, to give realism\nAnd spaciousness, and, even where it applies, to convey actual movement]\n\n[Verse 1]\nI start to go, my rhymes'll flow\nSo, get up and dance cause Kane said so\nIf you were lounging around it's time to get up\nPardon my expression, but I'mma tear shit up\nI appear right here, and scare and dare, a mere musketeer\nThat would dare to compare, I do declare\nGetting busy is where it's at\nBut what you're saying, you wouldn't get a point for that\nCause you're a featherweight, and your rhymes you carry light\nBut I drop bass just like Barry White\nSo how could you think that you pose a threat?\nYou say you're rocking, how many shows you get?\nAll your vocals go local on the M-I-C\nMines go a great distance, like AT&T\nI'm not new to this, I'm true to this, nothing you can do to this\nFuck around with Kane and come out black and blue for this\nSo, yo, go for what you know\nAttempt to debate so I can humiliate\nWe can go rhyme for rhyme, word for word, verse for verse\nGet you a nurse, too late, get you a hearse\nTo take you to your burial ground\nBecause the Big Daddy Kane always throws down\nCorrect, I get respect, I'm out to collect\nCash money, cause I get raw\n\n[Break]\nEverybody get up! (x4)\nKane: boy do I hate a...\nI'm coming! (x5)\n\n[Verse 2]\nHere I am, R-A-W\nA terrorist, here to bring trouble to\nPhony MC's, I move on and seize\nI just conquer and stomp another rapper with ease\nCause I'm at my apex and others are below\nNothing but a milliliter, I'm a kilo\nSecond to none, making MC's run\nSo don't try to step to me, cause I ain't the one\nI relieve rappers just like Tylenol\nAnd they know it, so I don't see why you all\nTry to front, perpetrating a stunt\nWhen you know that I'll smoke you up like a blunt\nI'm genuine like Gucci, raw like sushi\nTo stage a rage is what rap did to me\nTo make me want to create chaos and mayhem\nCold rock a party until the A.M\nI'll make a muscle, grab the mic and hustle\nWhile you stand dazed and amazed, I bust a\nLittle rhyme with authority, superiority\nAnd captivate the whole crowd's majority\nThe rhymes I use definitely amuse\nBetter than Dynasty, or Hill Street Blues\nI'm sure to score adored for more without a flaw\nCause I get raw\n\n[Break]\nEverybody get up! (x5)\n\n[Verse 3]\nGive a speech like a reverend, rappers start severing\nAnd in my lifetime, believe I've never been\nBeaten, or eaten and just tooken out\nYou know, come to think about it, I keep MC's looking out\nAnd real nervous when I'm at your service\nGive me that title, boy, you don't deserve this\nI work like a slave to become a master\nAnd when I say a rhyme, you know that it has to\nBe perfectly fitted, cause I'm committed\nThe entertainer and trainer and Kane'll get with it\nI go and flow and grow to let you know\nI damage ya I'm not an amateur but a pro-\n-fessional unquestionable without doubt superb\nSo full of action, my name should be a verb\nMy voice will float on every note\nWhen I clear my throat, that's all she wrote!\nThe minute that the Kane starts to go on\nBelieve it's gonna be smooth sailing so on\nAs I put other rappers out of their misery\nGet them in a battle and make them all history\nRuling and schooling MC's that I'm dueling\nWatch them all take a fall as I sit back cooling\nOn my throne, with a bronze microphone\nHmm, God bless the child that can hold his own\nCause I get raw\n\n[Break]\nAin't it good to you? (x3)\nDocumentary: here's an experiment to begin with...\n\n[Verse 4]\nTwenty-four sev chilling, killing like a villain\nThe meaning of raw is Ready And Willing\nTo do whatever is clever, take a loss, never\nAnd the rhymes I bust, coming off is a must\nAnd I come off hard with rhymes that are odd\nI rip the microphone and leave it scarred\nNever smoking or hitting or taking a sniff\nOnly crushing MC's that be trying to riff\nI get strong and titanic, do work like a mechanic\nMake MC's panic, they all get frantic\nAnd skeptic, like a girl on a contraceptive\nAs I rock but hey, what you expected?\nI'll get raw for you just like a warrior\nRapping like a samurai and I'll be damned if I\nEver let a Fisher-Price MC hang\nTheir rhymes are toy, nothing but yin-yang\nSo if we battle on the microphone\nBring your own casket and tombstone\nAnd I'mma preach your funeral\nTell me who in the world could ever come with more\nI get raw", "image": "https://images.genius.com/23d91f59169bb780391629dca6ffb63f.600x604x1.jpg", "artist": "Big Daddy Kane", "raw": {"annotation_count": 17, "api_path": "/songs/10180", "apple_music_id": null, "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/10180/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "The \u201cRaw\u201d single, released on Prism in late 1987, was Kane\u2019s first real calling card: five minutes of pure, unadulterated  braggadocio, with an incredibly Marley-freaked James Brown loop and Kane\u2019s unmistakable, testosterone-charged voice. The single took off, convincing the powers that be at Warner Bros. (who were partnered with Cold Chillin', where most of the Marley Marl/Juice Crew output was placed from the late 1987 onward) that Kane deserved an album.\n\nBig Daddy Kane: When it came to battle rhymes like that, I wrote that kind of stuff all the time. Like my man Murph would say, \u201cYo, there\u2019s this kid in Bushwick that was talking shit about you and wants to battle.\u201d So i\u2019d start writing rhymes like that.

The single took off, convincing the powers that be at Warner Bros. (who were partnered with Cold Chillin', where most of the Marley Marl/Juice Crew output was placed from the late 1987 onward) that Kane deserved an album.\n\nBig Daddy Kane: When it came to battle rhymes like that, I wrote that kind of stuff all the time. Like my man Murph would say, \u201cYo, there\u2019s this kid in Bushwick that was talking shit about you and wants to battle.\u201d So i\u2019d start writing rhymes like that.

man first heard a scratchy noise\nOn a cylindrical drum accompanied by staccato human tones\nIt has been his aim to add breadth and depth, to give realism\nAnd spaciousness, and, even where it applies, to convey actual movement]\n\n[Verse 1]\nI start to go, my rhymes'll flow\nSo, get up and dance cause Kane said so\nIf you were lounging around it's time to get up\nPardon my expression, but I'mma tear shit up\nI appear right here, and scare and dare, a mere musketeer\nThat would dare to compare, I do declare\nGetting busy is where it's at\nBut what you're saying, you wouldn't get a point for that\nCause you're a featherweight, and your rhymes you carry light\nBut I drop bass just like Barry White\nSo how could you think that you pose a threat?\nYou say you're rocking, how many shows you get?\nAll your vocals go local on the M-I-C\nMines go a great distance, like AT&T\nI'm not new to this, I'm true to this, nothing you can do to this\nFuck around with Kane and come out black and blue for this\nSo, yo, go for what you know\nAttempt to debate so I can humiliate\nWe can go rhyme for rhyme, word for word, verse for verse\nGet you a nurse, too late, get you a hearse\nTo take you to your burial ground\nBecause the Big Daddy Kane always throws down\nCorrect, I get respect, I'm out to collect\nCash money, cause I get raw\n\n[Break]\nEverybody get up! (x4)\nKane: boy do I hate a...\nI'm coming! (x5)\n\n[Verse 2]\nHere I am, R-A-W\nA terrorist, here to bring trouble to\nPhony MC's, I move on and seize\nI just conquer and stomp another rapper with ease\nCause I'm at my apex and others are below\nNothing but a milliliter, I'm a kilo\nSecond to none, making MC's run\nSo don't try to step to me, cause I ain't the one\nI relieve rappers just like Tylenol\nAnd they know it, so I don't see why you all\nTry to front, perpetrating a stunt\nWhen you know that I'll smoke you up like a blunt\nI'm genuine like Gucci, raw like sushi\nTo stage a rage is what rap did to me\nTo make me want to create chaos and mayhem\nCold rock a party until the A.M\nI'll make a muscle, grab the mic and hustle\nWhile you stand dazed and amazed, I bust a\nLittle rhyme with authority, superiority\nAnd captivate the whole crowd's majority\nThe rhymes I use definitely amuse\nBetter than Dynasty, or Hill Street Blues\nI'm sure to score adored for more without a flaw\nCause I get raw\n\n[Break]\nEverybody get up! (x5)\n\n[Verse 3]\nGive a speech like a reverend, rappers start severing\nAnd in my lifetime, believe I've never been\nBeaten, or eaten and just tooken out\nYou know, come to think about it, I keep MC's looking out\nAnd real nervous when I'm at your service\nGive me that title, boy, you don't deserve this\nI work like a slave to become a master\nAnd when I say a rhyme, you know that it has to\nBe perfectly fitted, cause I'm committed\nThe entertainer and trainer and Kane'll get with it\nI go and flow and grow to let you know\nI damage ya I'm not an amateur but a pro-\n-fessional unquestionable without doubt superb\nSo full of action, my name should be a verb\nMy voice will float on every note\nWhen I clear my throat, that's all she wrote!\nThe minute that the Kane starts to go on\nBelieve it's gonna be smooth sailing so on\nAs I put other rappers out of their misery\nGet them in a battle and make them all history\nRuling and schooling MC's that I'm dueling\nWatch them all take a fall as I sit back cooling\nOn my throne, with a bronze microphone\nHmm, God bless the child that can hold his own\nCause I get raw\n\n[Break]\nAin't it good to you? (x3)\nDocumentary: here's an experiment to begin with...\n\n[Verse 4]\nTwenty-four sev chilling, killing like a villain\nThe meaning of raw is Ready And Willing\nTo do whatever is clever, take a loss, never\nAnd the rhymes I bust, coming off is a must\nAnd I come off hard with rhymes that are odd\nI rip the microphone and leave it scarred\nNever smoking or hitting or taking a sniff\nOnly crushing MC's that be trying to riff\nI get strong and titanic, do work like a mechanic\nMake MC's panic, they all get frantic\nAnd skeptic, like a girl on a contraceptive\nAs I rock but hey, what you expected?\nI'll get raw for you just like a warrior\nRapping like a samurai and I'll be damned if I\nEver let a Fisher-Price MC hang\nTheir rhymes are toy, nothing but yin-yang\nSo if we battle on the microphone\nBring your own casket and tombstone\nAnd I'mma preach your funeral\nTell me who in the world could ever come with more\nI get raw"}}, {"title": "Show & Prove", "album": "Daddy's Home", "year": "1994-08-13", "lyrics": "[Scratches: DJ Premier]\nBust a move, we show and prove\n\n[Verse 1: Scoob]\nHa ha, hey hey, laugh now nigga\nMy man's right behind you, Kane pull the trigger\nI don't play, I'm from the hill where shit is real\nAnd I'll be on your ass like bugs on a windshield\nSo bring your grip or you can think twice\nCause I got more rhymes than a five pound bag of rice\nI'm hitting hard, oh word, I'm gon' rock it\nOnce the shit drops, that's dough to the pocket\nI cut hair and you still can't get no part\nYou couldn't deal with Scoob if we was playing cards\nBut if I got beef then it's time for code red\nMy gun is like a ho, it be taking mad niggas to bed\nSo hurry up and skedaddle\nEven if you join the army, you still couldn't battle\nSo where you from?

Messiah that's feared great, leaving rappers in a weird state\nScared straight, for their prepared fate\nStrong as an elephant, intelligent, compelling and elegant\nSo well in it with every single

hill where shit is real\nAnd I'll be on your ass like bugs on a windshield\nSo bring your grip or you can think twice\nCause I got more rhymes than a five pound bag of rice\nI'm hitting hard, oh word, I'm gon' rock it\nOnce the shit drops, that's dough to the pocket\nI cut hair and you still can't get no part\nYou couldn't deal with Scoob if we was playing cards\nBut if I got beef then it's time for code red\nMy gun is like a ho, it be taking mad niggas to bed\nSo hurry up and skedaddle\nEven if you join the army, you still couldn't battle\nSo where you from? England, you somebody great?\nYou burning Scoob, \"I don't think so mate\"\nI got the style that get you open like a bag of smoke\nI'll have your friends saying \"Ah man, that shit is dope\"\nLeave me alone when I'm rocking on the microphone\nAnd play like E.T. and phone your black ass home\nYo Sauce, if you're down with the groove\nGet on the mic and won't ya show and prove\n\n[Verse 2: Sauce]\nHey, here I come with a slick rap, tic tac toe\nWhen I flip tracks, so gimme my dick, back\nI flow to it and through it, if you ever need to wonder\nHow you got dope like Sauce, money you didn't do it\nI write my own with bigger hope, drink of Scope\nWrote what I figured, nope, damn you dig a nigga doe\nRhymes too drastic, bastard, pull hookers like elastic\nNBA style, fantastic\nNo time to bite, but I just might, tonight\nI write left-handed cause I like to grab my dick with my right\nWho could ever say that I don't get plenty play\nWin lose or draw, I'm booking whores, anyway\nAs I get ready I'm steady if I go crazy I'd take Eddie\nIf I was Fred, I think I'd have to bone Betty\nSucking and lucking, hey, niggas I'm ducking, nay\nNada no never meaning ain't no motherfuckin way\nRappers get gassed come on and get fast\nTry to get past when I blast, and you can hand over your ass\nOne line and that's fear\nRappers get so damn pussy they gotta go for a pap smear\nSo Shyheim, if you're down with the groove\nGet on the mic it's time to show and prove\n\n[Verse 3: Shyheim]\nI spark the mic like weed that's in a cipher\nAnd I get girls open like a reggae song by Tiger\nSo check me out, as I flip this here track kid\nAnd make mad noise like a Metallica record\nI'm psycho, a villain to the styles I be killing\nWhen I'm thrusted, and all competition gets dusted\nCause I rock the world from U.S.A. to Asia to Russia\nIf your shit stinks I'mma flush ya, then bust ya\nLike a crazy man from Cali son\nMy jams be packed like a Farrakhan rally, what?\nYou know my style, I put the F in effin foul\nThe Rugged Child lock shit down like Rikers Isle\nAnd got more girls than a trailer load with Shabba\nMore Super than Cat, I'm the punani Don Dada\nSo Big Daddy, if you're down with the groove my man\nGet on the mic and won't ya show and prove\n\n[Verse 4: Big Daddy Kane]\nNow tell me who is the man?\nWith the high-potent lyrics no rapper can ever stand\nAnd stepping to me, thinking I can be touched?\nNot even Michael Jordan'll gamble that much, yo\nI get down on it and give it to rappers that even act like they want it\nI come for your title kid, run it!\nOr else get hit with the ultimate, too legit skit\nAhh yeah, that's that shit\nDrop lyrics on ya, strong as ammonia\nThat'll dethrone ya, scorn ya, joan ya, I tried to warn ya\nYou was wack since I known ya, fake as a cubic zirconia\nWhat I just shown ya, real lyrics doggone ya\nLook inside my rap book at every text my man\nAnd see that I got, more essays than the Mexican\nThe Messiah that's feared great, leaving rappers in a weird state\nScared straight, for their prepared fate\nStrong as an elephant, intelligent, compelling and elegant\nSo well in it with every single element\nAnd competition gets none\nIf I was wearing pantyhose you still couldn't give me no run\nI see the way you're trying to get to me\nBut with that speech impedi-ment, man you gotta come better G\nYou're hitting all the wrong switches troop begin again\nMumble mouth rappers couldn't last a minute with\nThe non-resistable, non-competible\nNo No No I'm not saying I'm the best\nI'm just saying I'm fucking incredible\nAnd let's just make one more thing understood\nThat if I fart on a record, trust me nigga it'll sound good\nSo Jay-Z, if you're down with the groove, my mellow\nGet on the mic it's time to show and prove\n\n[Verse 5: Jay-Z]\nOne checking it two, checking it three\nCheck out the J, check out the A, check out the Y, check out the Z\nAight G!\nI'm breaking MC's up like EPMD\nAnd these nuts if you rappers trying to see me\nI'm buckwild with styles, ta-dow\nI've been in it running a hundred miles I'm well endowed, baby gal\nUhh, the greatest nigga to touch it, you niggas can't fuck with\nThe, incredible skills of the G from Brooklyn, big up kid\nAnd ain't no eating me up, you fast fuckin with jigga\nI'm like Prince jeans, I bring the ass out a nigga\nWhen I rock it it's in the pocket, baby mop it don't knock it\nTill you try it, once you start, you can't stop it\nI'm the cocky breed, I'm dope like poppy seed\nI live one rent from besides that be\nBetween get off my dick and stop jockin me\nWhen I bust a rhyme you're diggin the sound\nI know you loving the way it's, goin down baby\nSo Ason huh, if you're down with the groove, why don't ya\nGet on the mic and show and prove\n\n[Verse 6: Ol Dirty Bastard]\nCome on\nWu-Tang killa bees on a swarm\nRain on your college ass, disco dorm\nSlippery when wet and don't you ever forget\nYou couldn't get a flick, of the hype outfit\nBecause the way that I dress this style mad wild\nEnough to make a crowd of women scream \"Ow!\"\nWhether at a party or just in bed\nAll thoughts on Ason, keep that in your head\nYuh, my beats are funky and my rhymes are spunky\nSometimes I'll be like \"Well god damn what's the recipe?\"\nI don't know, I ask my momma she don't know\nShe says \"Go ask your goddamn father!\"\nIt's all about me in the place to be\nNiggas think they all that, yo, that shit is G\nMad game and it's a motherfucking shame\nHow many enemies wanna claim the name\nOf Ason, who carries on

(Pimpin' ain't easy)\nPimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)\nPimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)\nPimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)\n\n[Verse 1:Greg Nice]\nOne-two-three-four, to five-six-seven\nEight, nine-ten, then ya got eleven\nTwelve, thirteen, start your age\nFourteen, fifteen, sixteen, the pubic stage\nLike an apple, like a cherry, like a peach, like a plum\nLet me get off the virgin before I cum\nPick up my pants and thump and thump\nI think I'll call up Tootie, she'll give me some\nWatch out, watch out I'm drippin' live scum\nI say damn, I love the way I make my posse roll-a\n'Specially when the hoochie's on birth control-a\nLift her up just like a pick-up truck\nThen I sat her down and we started to fuck\nMade whoopie, made whoopie, made whoopie, yo\nI hope this time I don't make a cookie\nBrothers everywhere be callin' me a rookie\nTwo from the Greg Nice from the old school\nBut bullshit, I ain't no fool, 'cause\n\n[Hook]\nAnything goes when it comes to hoes, they go\nPimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)\nPimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)\nPimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)\nPimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)\nPimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)\nPimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)\n\n[Verse 2: Big Daddy Kane]\nWell, I say... Extra!

next\nAttack, react, exact, the mack'll move you with\nA strong song, as long as you groove to this\nI keep the crowd loud when you're hype\nDo damage onstage and injure the mic\nAs I shoot the gift MC's stand stiff\nWhile my rhymes stick to you like Skippy and Jif\nFeel my blood fist, or my death kiss\nThe rap soloist, you don't want none of this\nSupreme in this era, I reign with terror\nWhen I grab the mic believe you're gonna hear a\nFascinatin' rhyme as I enchant them\nSo let's all sing the Big Daddy anthem\nGo with the flow, my rhymes grow like an afro\nI entertain again and Kane'll never have no\nProblem, I can sneeze, sniffle and cough\nE-e-e-even if I stutter I'mma still come off\nCos rappers can't understand the mics I rip\nThey sure enough ain't equipped, that's why they got flipped\nBut my apparatus is up to status\nDon't ask who's the baddest, of course that is\nThe maker, breaker, taker, my rhymes ache the head\nPut it to bed, so watch what is said\nSave the bass for the pipe and rearrange your tone\nOr take a loss and be forced in the danger zone\nCos I get ill and kill at will\nTeachin a skill that's real, you're no frill\nSo just stand still and chill as I build\nScience I drill until my rhymes fill\nYour head up...don't even get up\nThe teacher is teachin', so just shut up\n\n[Chorus x3]\n\"I can't hold it back\"\nSet it off\nNow break loose\n\n[Verse 2]\nRappers, take a step back, or you will soon regret that\nYou ever had to confront me and you can bet that\nI come correct, perfect, in full effect\nDisconnect, dissect, eject as I wreck shop\nStand in command with the clan\nCaravan or van, we go man for man and\nWithout further ado or any delay\nMister Cee as we say, call him the DJ\nMad Money Murf with the triple M\nSmooth the barber keepin' my flat-top trim\nScoob Lover my brother, Scrap Lover my other\nDancin' with the crew so allow the boys to smother\nThe floor, and endure just for your pleasure\nAs the microphone lord proceeds to get raw\nAcrobatic, Asiatic, rap fanatic\nI get dramatic and rhymes start flowin' automatically\nFrom me, so don't play me, obey me\nWhen asked \"Who's the best?\", you better say me\nI'm sendin' sucker MC's headin' north\nAnd if you still want some...set if off\nFor you to cope is just a wish and a hope\nAnd if you are what you eat they're feedin' me dope\nCos I'm just about as dope as dope can get\nUltimate, legit, Kane is a perfect fit\nThe king of my kingdom, completin' a cipher\nThe lyrics I bring them keeps the crowd hyper\nAs I release the masterpiece\nThe groove will never cease until Kane says \"Peace\"\nSo, maestro, yo, hit it\nBig Daddy Kane's about to come with it, cause...\n\n[Chorus x3]\n\"I can't hold it back\"\nSet it off\nNow break loose"}}, {"title": "Warm it

superior\nUltimate, and all that good shit\nI'm the original, Asiatic, acrobatic\nThere you have it, now get dramatic\nCreatin' drama when I'm on the scene\nAnd I pack 'em in mean, like Bruce Springsteen\nI profile a style that's mild and meanwhile\nPut on trial, a rap pile to exile\nMake you tumble and stumble, in a rumble just crumble\nAnd I'm still calm and humble\nYou need another helpin' hand to swing on\nI stand alone, but still you gotta bring on\nYour Batman and Robin, Cagney and Lacey\nStarsky and Hutch, but they still can't face me\nAnd if may make this one thing here clear\nThat's for you not to come near, period\nSo I ain't buggin' or delirious\nMy swift tongue's like a sword, that's how severe it is\nAnd I can slice and dice a Fisher-Price MC\nThat thought he was nice into Minute Rice\nSingle-handed, I ain't with that band stuff\nCause Cee'll scratch a record like flakes of dandruff\nAnd the mic I ravage, not like a savage\nBut in my own way of doin' damage\nAs I design the genuine line\nNow who flattop rules in eighty-nine?\n\n[Hook]\nWarm it up, Kane, Warm it up, Kane\nWarm it up, Kane, Warm it up, Kane\nWarm it up, Kane, Warm it up, Kane\nWarm it up, Kane, Warm it up, Kane\nWarm it up, Kane, Warm it up, Kane\nWarm it up, Kane, Warm it up, Kane\nWarm it up, Kane, Warm it up, Kane\nWarm it up, Kane, Warm it up, Kane\n\n[Verse 2]\nTake two other men with soul that you probably know\nDeadly as Scarface, but bright as the Cosby show\nDon't attack rappers, but make everyone hush\nThey step to me, but can't stop the bum rush\nI make material, rich and imperial\nThe unique technique I speak is all original\nYou like to sag and drag and gag\nSame old same old, but papa's got a brand new bag\nSo put the mic down boy, you can't work it\nDue to wack lyrics, it's bout to short circuit\nSo toss the sauce across to the boss, no remorse\nYou lost, with force, of course, a holocaust\nFirst I caught ya, then put ya through torture\nYou moved wrong my son, so I taught ya\nJust like a guardian, that put your body in\nThe mood to groove with the smooth way that I'm partyin'\nCompetition may find it spectacular\nScheme and fiend to take a bite like Dracula\nAnd waste the taste, cause ain't no sugar here\nSo come near if you dare, you Booger Bear\nYou start hallucinatin' like magic\nThe wrath gets tragic, but Kane won't have it\nCause you tried to juice me when you're bluffin'\nSlowed the pace, so I had to start rushin'\nSo pick a B.C. date, cause you're history\nHere comes Kane, Scoob, Scrap, Jay, and Mister Cee\nAnd this is one thing to us we ain't new to\nThe crew'll cast a spell on the crowd just like voodoo\nI'm the man you can't hold back\nAnd all competition appears to be weak\nI meant to say wack, a vision of blur\nJust them thinkin' I'm competitin', I say, \"Huh!\"\n\n[Hook]\nWarm it up, Kane, Warm it up, Kane\nWarm it up, Kane, Warm it up, Kane\nWarm it up, Kane, Warm it up, Kane\nWarm it up, Kane, Warm it up, Kane\nWarm it up, Kane, Warm it up, Kane\nWarm it up, Kane, Warm it up, Kane\nWarm it up, Kane, Warm it up, Kane\nWarm it up, Kane, Warm it up, Kane\n\n[Outro]\nGenuine for eighty-nine, you know what I'm sayin?\nAs I give a shout out to my man Tony A\nTony P, Sally Sal and the whole Libra Digital posse\nCan't forget my man Yawnski\nAnd Smooth the Barber, you know what I'm sayin?\nAlso, I gotta say whassup to Born True, B-Boy\nAnd my man big Jay-Z\nThe whole rest of the crew, Scoob Lover my brother\nScrap Lover, and DJ Mister Cee\nCan't forget Supreme, Abu, MelQuan and Shabazz\nWally D, and the rest of the brothers\nAnd of course my little brother the Little Daddy Shane\nMandatory end of the story, you know what I'm sayin?\nPeace!", "image":

superior\nUltimate, and all that good shit\nI'm the original, Asiatic, acrobatic\nThere you have it, now get dramatic\nCreatin' drama when I'm on the scene\nAnd I pack 'em in mean, like Bruce Springsteen\nI profile a style that's mild and meanwhile\nPut on trial, a rap pile to exile\nMake you tumble and stumble, in a rumble just crumble\nAnd I'm still calm and humble\nYou need another helpin' hand to swing on\nI stand alone, but still you gotta bring on\nYour Batman and Robin, Cagney and Lacey\nStarsky and Hutch, but they still can't face me\nAnd if may make this one thing here clear\nThat's for you not to come near, period\nSo I ain't buggin' or delirious\nMy swift tongue's like a sword, that's how severe it is\nAnd I can slice and dice a Fisher-Price MC\nThat thought he was nice into Minute Rice\nSingle-handed, I ain't with that band stuff\nCause Cee'll scratch a record like flakes of dandruff\nAnd the mic I ravage, not like a savage\nBut in my own way of doin' damage\nAs I design the genuine line\nNow who flattop rules in eighty-nine?\n\n[Hook]\nWarm it up, Kane, Warm it up, Kane\nWarm it up, Kane, Warm it up, Kane\nWarm it up, Kane, Warm it up, Kane\nWarm it up, Kane, Warm it up, Kane\nWarm it up, Kane, Warm it up, Kane\nWarm it up, Kane, Warm it up, Kane\nWarm it up, Kane, Warm it up, Kane\nWarm it up, Kane, Warm it up, Kane\n\n[Verse 2]\nTake two other men with soul that you probably know\nDeadly as Scarface, but bright as the Cosby show\nDon't attack rappers, but make everyone hush\nThey step to me, but can't stop the bum rush\nI make material, rich and imperial\nThe unique technique I speak is all original\nYou like to sag and drag and gag\nSame old same old, but papa's got a brand new bag\nSo put the mic down boy, you can't work it\nDue to wack lyrics, it's bout to short circuit\nSo toss the sauce across to the boss, no remorse\nYou lost, with force, of course, a holocaust\nFirst I caught ya, then put ya through torture\nYou moved wrong my son, so I taught ya\nJust like a guardian, that put your body in\nThe mood to groove with the smooth way that I'm partyin'\nCompetition may find it spectacular\nScheme and fiend to take a bite like Dracula\nAnd waste the taste, cause ain't no sugar here\nSo come near if you dare, you Booger Bear\nYou start hallucinatin' like magic\nThe wrath gets tragic, but Kane won't have it\nCause you tried to juice me when you're bluffin'\nSlowed the pace, so I had to start rushin'\nSo pick a B.C. date, cause you're history\nHere comes Kane, Scoob, Scrap, Jay, and Mister Cee\nAnd this is one thing to us we ain't new to\nThe crew'll cast a spell on the crowd just like voodoo\nI'm the man you can't hold back\nAnd all competition appears to be weak\nI meant to say wack, a vision of blur\nJust them thinkin' I'm competitin', I say, \"Huh!\"\n\n[Hook]\nWarm it up, Kane, Warm it up, Kane\nWarm it up, Kane, Warm it up, Kane\nWarm it up, Kane, Warm it up, Kane\nWarm it up, Kane, Warm it up, Kane\nWarm it up, Kane, Warm it up, Kane\nWarm it up, Kane, Warm it up, Kane\nWarm it up, Kane, Warm it up, Kane\nWarm it up, Kane, Warm it up, Kane\n\n[Outro]\nGenuine for eighty-nine, you know what I'm sayin?\nAs I give a shout out to my man Tony A\nTony P, Sally Sal and the whole Libra Digital posse\nCan't forget my man Yawnski\nAnd Smooth the Barber, you know what I'm sayin?\nAlso, I gotta say whassup to Born True, B-Boy\nAnd my man big Jay-Z\nThe whole rest of the crew, Scoob Lover my brother\nScrap Lover, and DJ Mister Cee\nCan't forget Supreme, Abu, MelQuan and Shabazz\nWally D, and the rest of the brothers\nAnd of course my little brother the Little Daddy Shane\nMandatory end of the story, you know what I'm sayin?\nPeace!"}}, {"title": "Just Rhymin' with Biz", "album":

know?\n\n[Intro: rapped]\nYeah baby c'mon\nAh baby baby c'mon, check the rhyme to the song\nUhh, aw yeah baby c'mon\nAh baby baby c'mon, and check the rhyme to the song\n\nOne double nine to the four, gotta keep 'em on the floor\nAnd put some real lyrics back in the hardcore\nWhat I'm used to hearin', I can't believe it's gone\nBut now just like a grill inside Burger King, the beef is on\nWhen I come, rappers begin to speak in degrees\nI even make Sisters With Voices weak in the knees\nSo run for your lives, Kane with the pen\nIs like Freddy with the glove full of knives\nWho wanna test these skills, come see how it feels\nI pull you one verse, if that don't kill I got refills\nYou can't do me none, kid you gets nothin'\nIf my rhymes was in Braille, you still couldn't touch em\nMan, I'm a bad cat, my style of rap is mad fat\nAnd you know, sometimes it's so sad that\nRappers today be comin' as the gangster rhyme type\nAnd be so soft, they wouldn't even kill time right\nHere's the news, you lettin' the word hardcore be misused\nYou ain't never paid dues\nBe for real, you ain't tough yet\nThe razor bumps on your throat is the only thing makin' you a ruffneck\nYour whole image is a dammmmn sham\nI'm glad in this business I didn't forget who I am\nI always remain the Kane inside a battle\nNever to walk in anyone's shadow\nI do my own thing, I do a thing of my own\nAnd with my competition I let it be known\nThat battles I don't lose none, boy you get bruised son\nSix million ways to die -- choose one!\nMy rap style is like a poisonous vemon\nWe might as well be havin' sex, the way that I put it in 'em\nAnd do I crush MCs? are you kiddin me?\nIf rappers were grapes, I'd have a whole wine distillery\nSo, I bring it to your face, with the bass, then I blow\nA rapper off the map, with the rap, when I flow\nThen hit you with the skill that is ill, and I know\nThat all of this is good to go, 'cause yo\nThat's the way the flavor always come\nThe rhymes they flow accordin' to the drum\nThe Brooklyn style cause that is where I'm from\nYou want the funk so let me give you some\nI flip on the flow on the track, just like that\nAmazin' the people the style of the rappin', is quite fat\nI'm lickin' the lyrics and shootin' the gat, on the mic, black\nAnd this is for all of the rappers that like, and they bite that\nThe Smooth Operator is mellow with the saxophone\nSettin' the tone that make the girls relax and moan\n'Cause all the ladies I'm givin' 'em lots of love\nHittin' more skins than a boxing glove, good God\nThe girls treat me like the drummer and give me some\nFrom tall to short to thick, even the slimmy ones\nWatch out Goldie! Gimme a forty ounce of Olde E\nAnd none of you players can control me\nYou get the chance to see a true mack man\nWith skills to pay the bills, to make more stacks than\nTaller than anybody else's stacks it seem\nCause the Kane get more paper than a fax machine\nThe unforgettable, rhymes are too poetical\nKeep rappers in order more than letters put alphabetical\nAnd I hope the record consumers don't believe the magazine rumors\n'Cause Kane is makin' a comeback, like Pumas\nI get rough G, and set it on your whole damn company\nAnd Bogart, like my name was Humphrey\nWhen I get through, there'll be no more of them\nAs many rappers I burnt, I should open a crematorium\nI make mad MC's give me my P's\nIf you try to disrespect, kid you can get these\nN.U.T.s, like the U.N.V.s\nI leave you down on your knees, down on your knee-hees!\nRazor sharp, many ways of art\nSource rings the chart, people praise the God\nFor kickin' the flows so fantastic and this one here\nWe're callin' it Lyrical Gymnastics\n\nUhh, so baby baby c'mon\nAw yeah baby c'mon, and check the rhymes to the song\nUhh, ah baby baby c'mon\nSuki suki c'mon, and I'm gone!"}}, {"title": "Very Special", "album": "Looks Like a Job For...", "year": "1993-05-25", "lyrics": "[Production By Big Daddy Kane]\n\n[Verse 1: Big Daddy Kane]\nMy, my, my, yes, I must admit\nThat I have never knew love like this before\nAnd I adore everything about you\nI do mean every part of\nFor meeting someone this beautiful, have mercy\nI wanna kiss ya, father\nYou're the kinda girl I wanna get closer to\nBecome the most to you like love is supposed to do\nCuz I fell straight into your trap\nAnd since they say love is blind, I'm the Ray Charles of rap\nAnd I'm waiting for you to put me in your mix\nBecause ya got my nose open like a jar of Vicks\nI'll be your king, baby, you can be my queen\nUh, let's stay together like Al Green because\n\n[Chorus: Karen Anderson and Laree Williams]\nAll my love is all I have\nAnd my dreams are very special\nAll my life I looked for you\nAnd today my dreams come true\nYou need me and I need you\nLove in us is very special\nThings you seem to do divine\nYou look straight into my eyes\nOh, our love was meant to be\nCause our souls touch tenderly\nLove is life and life is living very special\n\n[Verse 2: Spinderella]\nWell I must admit that you know how to treat a woman\nDon't stop your love, like Keith Sweat, keep it comin'\nAnd our relationship won't ever get dull\nBecause you're always on my mind even more than my own skull\nYou're always givin' me respect and chivalry\nAnd I can't wait for your enticing delivery\nStaying together is a must\nThose Tropicana drinks don't blend as good as us\nWe were made for each other, meant for one another\nNeither one of us needs another lover\nAnd just so it can stay that way\nYo, I'm on your side like Jennifer Holiday because\n\n[Chorus: Karen Anderson and Laree Williams]\nAll my love is all I have\nAnd my dreams are very special\nAll my life I looked for you\nAnd today my dreams come true\nYou need me and I need you\nLove in us is very special\nThings you seem to do divine\nYou look straight into my eyes\nOh, our love was meant to be\nCause our souls touch tenderly\nLove is life and life is living very special\n\n[Verse 3: Big Daddy Kane and Spinderella]\nI talk the macho talk but keep my real feelings hidden\nBut what about that \"Pimpin' Ain't Easy\" stuff?

like this before\nAnd I adore everything about you\nI do mean every part of\nFor meeting someone this beautiful, have mercy\nI wanna kiss ya, father\nYou're the kinda girl I wanna get closer to\nBecome the most to you like love is supposed to do\nCuz I fell straight into your trap\nAnd since they say love is blind, I'm the Ray Charles of rap\nAnd I'm waiting for you to put me in your mix\nBecause ya got my nose open like a jar of Vicks\nI'll be your king, baby, you can be my queen\nUh, let's stay together like Al Green because\n\n[Chorus: Karen Anderson and Laree Williams]\nAll my love is all I have\nAnd my dreams are very special\nAll my life I looked for you\nAnd today my dreams come true\nYou need me and I need you\nLove in us is very special\nThings you seem to do divine\nYou look straight into my eyes\nOh, our love was meant to be\nCause our souls touch tenderly\nLove is life and life is living very special\n\n[Verse 2: Spinderella]\nWell I must admit that you know how to treat a woman\nDon't stop your love, like Keith Sweat, keep it comin'\nAnd our relationship won't ever get dull\nBecause you're always on my mind even more than my own skull\nYou're always givin' me respect and chivalry\nAnd I can't wait for your enticing delivery\nStaying together is a must\nThose Tropicana drinks don't blend as good as us\nWe were made for each other, meant for one another\nNeither one of us needs another lover\nAnd just so it can stay that way\nYo, I'm on your side like Jennifer Holiday because\n\n[Chorus: Karen Anderson and Laree Williams]\nAll my love is all I have\nAnd my dreams are very special\nAll my life I looked for you\nAnd today my dreams come true\nYou need me and I need you\nLove in us is very special\nThings you seem to do divine\nYou look straight into my eyes\nOh, our love was meant to be\nCause our souls touch tenderly\nLove is life and life is living very special\n\n[Verse 3: Big Daddy Kane and Spinderella]\nI talk the macho talk but keep my real feelings hidden\nBut what about that \"Pimpin' Ain't Easy\" stuff? Aw, I was just kiddin'\nCause if we unite, baby, I'd do ya right\nWell I hope you meant that mushy stuff you told Barry White\nBecause I think I know you well enough to be understood\nWell let's talk about sex, babe No, not that good\nBut Spinderella, yes, Miss, I'll still persist\nWell since you put it like that Daddy, then we can do this\n\n[Chorus: Karen Anderson and Laree Williams]\nAll my love is all I have\nAnd my dreams are very special\nAll my life I looked for you\nAnd today my dreams come true\nYou need me and I need you\nLove in us is very special\nThings you seem to do divine\nYou look straight into my eyes\nOh, our love was meant to be\nCause our souls touch tenderly\nLove is life and life is living very special\n\n[Bridge]\nI wanna give ya my love\nCuz you're the only one I'm thinking of\nI wanna give my love\nCuz you're the only one I'm thinking of\nI wanna give ya my love\nCuz you're the only one I'm thinking of"}}, {"title": "Young, Gifted and Black",

when that individual, I make, NO apologies\nFor what I'm about to say\n\n[Verse 1: Big Daddy Kane]\nRough, rugged and real, you're on standstill\nTo obey okay so let the man build\nWords of rapture that you have to capture\nAnd I just slapped ya\nWith the hand full of literature\nThat's dope def fresh hype choice smooth and raw\nRappers I replace, rub out, and erase\nCompetition you must be on freebase\nSmokin' or chokin', bound to be broken\nMan, get your damn hands off the mic that I'm chokin!\nCause I got a stranglehold\nYou\u2019re still cold on parole for the role you stole\nRhymes that you yell out, but you did sell out\nCrossed-over, lost over here, now get the hell out\nI'm not a pop star, rock'n'roller\nI'm a rebel, BLESSED, able to hold a\nMic like a hammer, and drop grammar\nTreat a rapper like a wrestler, and body slam him\nThose who dispute get treated just like a prostitute\nThey get the boot and played like a flute\nSo just PLAY mute, don't even whisper\nOpen your mouth to speak and I'm diss ya\nRagtag and dog, put you in the morgue\nBecause you're petty confetti and not ready to rock steady\nIn other words, you're half-steppin'\nTiptoein, get goin, because my weapon\nIs not a nine, an uzi or a shotgun\nBut when it come to hype rhymes I got one\nJust like the album is still the same\n\"Long Live the Kane,\" ain't a damn thing changed\nI still get ill and kill at will and build the skill\nTo fill your grill so don't tell me you're real\nWe sample beats, you sue and try to fight us\n*tchk* Maaaan, you still be home with arthritis!\nIf we didn't revive em, bring back alive\nOld beats that we appreciated, you wouldn't survive\nYou'd be another memory to us\nAshes to ashes and dust to dust\nSo understand, the way that I live\nThat's positive - and the message I got to give\nIt's a benefit for you and me\nI'm talkin bout P.E.A.C.E\nThe chosen one that has turned a new leaf\nI got gold teeth, and they don't chew beef\nNo pork on my fork, strictly fish on my dish\nThe Kane fallin victim? *tchk* Sucker, you wish\nI flow like water, slaughter\nPut you out of order.. floored ya!\nRappers are raggin and taggin and snaggin and braggin\nTo be on the bandwagon, but I'm the Last Dragon\nWith the knack to attract the pack\nSo just GET BACK, I'm young, gifted and black\n\nAnd just go with the flow you know\nIn the place to be with my man Marley Marl\nSendin' this out to Divine Force\nCan't forget my main man Heavy D\nAnd to my good brothers EPMD\nAnd to my man Ice-T over on the West Coast\nCan't forget Kool Moe Dee, Busy Bee, MC Lyte, the Audio Two\nI say, peace!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e5112b31d8bd715b9e736175eff672d9.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Big Daddy Kane", "raw": {"annotation_count": 15, "api_path":

nature\nWe call an INDIVIDUAL, into existence\nAnd when that individual, I make, NO apologies\nFor what I'm about to say\n\n[Verse 1: Big Daddy Kane]\nRough, rugged and real, you're on standstill\nTo obey okay so let the man build\nWords of rapture that you have to capture\nAnd I just slapped ya\nWith the hand full of literature\nThat's dope def fresh hype choice smooth and raw\nRappers I replace, rub out, and erase\nCompetition you must be on freebase\nSmokin' or chokin', bound to be broken\nMan, get your damn hands off the mic that I'm chokin!\nCause I got a stranglehold\nYou\u2019re still cold on parole for the role you stole\nRhymes that you yell out, but you did sell out\nCrossed-over, lost over here, now get the hell out\nI'm not a pop star, rock'n'roller\nI'm a rebel, BLESSED, able to hold a\nMic like a hammer, and drop grammar\nTreat a rapper like a wrestler, and body slam him\nThose who dispute get treated just like a prostitute\nThey get the boot and played like a flute\nSo just PLAY mute, don't even whisper\nOpen your mouth to speak and I'm diss ya\nRagtag and dog, put you in the morgue\nBecause you're petty confetti and not ready to rock steady\nIn other words, you're half-steppin'\nTiptoein, get goin, because my weapon\nIs not a nine, an uzi or a shotgun\nBut when it come to hype rhymes I got one\nJust like the album is still the same\n\"Long Live the Kane,\" ain't a damn thing changed\nI still get ill and kill at will and build the skill\nTo fill your grill so don't tell me you're real\nWe sample beats, you sue and try to fight us\n*tchk* Maaaan, you still be home with arthritis!\nIf we didn't revive em, bring back alive\nOld beats that we appreciated, you wouldn't survive\nYou'd be another memory to us\nAshes to ashes and dust to dust\nSo understand, the way that I live\nThat's positive - and the message I got to give\nIt's a benefit for you and me\nI'm talkin bout P.E.A.C.E\nThe chosen one that has turned a new leaf\nI got gold teeth, and they don't chew beef\nNo pork on my fork, strictly fish on my dish\nThe Kane fallin victim? *tchk* Sucker, you wish\nI flow like water, slaughter\nPut you out of order.. floored ya!\nRappers are raggin and taggin and snaggin and braggin\nTo be on the bandwagon, but I'm the Last Dragon\nWith the knack to attract the pack\nSo just GET BACK, I'm young, gifted and black\n\nAnd just go with the flow you know\nIn the place to be with my man Marley Marl\nSendin' this out to Divine Force\nCan't forget my main man Heavy D\nAnd to my good brothers EPMD\nAnd to my man Ice-T over on the West Coast\nCan't forget Kool Moe Dee, Busy Bee, MC Lyte, the Audio Two\nI say, peace!"}}, {"title": "I Get the Job Done", "album": "It's a Big Daddy Thing", "year": "1989-09-19", "lyrics": "[Kane] Hey yo Teddy\n[Riley] Yo\n[Kane] I ran into a young lady Maliya last night\n[Riley] Word?\n[Kane] Must have been her husband's payday\n[Riley] Heheh\n[Kane] because she bought me this here brand new\nDiamond link that you see me with on\n[Riley] Mmm\n[Kane] Smooth, you knowhatI'msayin? You know why?\n[Riley] Why Kane?\n[Kane] Cause I get the job done\n\n[Hook x2]\n\"I work\" (x3)\n\"I work.. baby!\"\n\n[Verse 1: Big Daddy Kane]\nThe question at hand, is how do I love thee?\nI count the ways but girls don't shove me\nOne by one you can come and caress me\nUndress and molest me but you can't posess me\nBecause I love a young lady that's beautiful\nBut one that's smart for me, is more suitable\nIn other words, to make it simple and plain\nYou gotta have a brain in order to be Ms. Kane\nBut in the case of not becomin my lady\nI take em eight to eighty, dumb crippled and crazy\nCrisp and clean with no caffeine\nAnd a pair of spandex or either tight jeans\nCouldn't believe the ones with the Chinese cuts\nBut I'll take 'em with the weave hangin down to they butts\nAnd if you step up in a large sum\nLike Martin Luther King, I Shall Overcome\nI get the job done\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Big Daddy Kane]\nSome of you ladies make moves too quick\nAnd settle down, without havin a large pick\nRushed into becoming some poohbutt's wife\nAnd no longer do you enjoy, the married life\nWell, I let you know this is a brand new year\nSo never fear, the Big Daddy is here\nTo do things in places your husband wouldn't\nAnd do certain things he probably just couldn't\nLet me sneak into your life, like a thief in the night\nLick your body all over and squeeze you real tight\nNibble all over your ear and give your back a massage\nYou'll say, \"Oooh I like it,\" just like DeBarge (how large)\nSmooth and mild I'll make you smile, honey child\nThen hit the lights and get buckwild\nAnd when I turn her back on, you'll have to say\nLike Calgon, please take me away\nSo when your main course is doin nothin for ya\nJust look at me as a tasty side order\nThat came into your life and brought a thrill\nCause any husband won't, I'm a neighbor who will, get the job done..\n\n[Hook]\n\nT.R., take it to the bridge, uhh!\n\n[Verse 3: Big Daddy Kane]\nHere's a perfect description of me\nSix foot one, and dark and lovely\nAnd if they're sayin black is beautiful, it's true not phony\nI'm Brown-er than Bobby so won't you be my +Tenderoni+\nAnd get a whiff of this nymphomaniac\nAn up-to-date mack that's ready to attack\nAnd prove that I'm a pro and far from a rookie\nAin't no hair on my chest, but I'm one tough cookie\nWhoever said you had to be one-hundred percent\nMasculine in order to be in?\nI'd rather be more subtle and smooth and SOOTH\nGirl, you won't disapprove\nAnd I promise that you'll never forget\nHmmmmmmmmmmm, now what's a title to fit me?\nA champ like Tyson, a Captain like Kirk, no\nEmployee of the Month, cause yo, I do work\nThe K-A-N-E is on the J-O-B\nAn expert, cause I get it D-O-N-E\nSo lights, camera, action - all hail the one!\nThat gets the job done\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e5112b31d8bd715b9e736175eff672d9.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Big Daddy Kane", "raw": {"annotation_count": 7, "api_path":

chose to oppose, friend or foes\nI still dispose, and blow 'em out like afros\nSo many rappers have fronted to get a name out\nYelling and screaming and dreaming but still came out\nOff the wall and butter soft to y'all\nSo you waited for Kane to come forth to all\nCompetition, that bite and chew and crunch and munch\nTo play me out position, you on a mission\nSo stop lying and trying to front adventures\nYour rhymes are more false than dentures\nFreeze, as I get warm like a heater\nYou bite like a mosquito, but still can't complete a\nRhyme or find the time to design a line\nOr phrase that pays, so you dine on mine\nInstead of fronting and trying to be a friend of\nYou might as well say guess who's coming to dinner\nSo just quit, submit and forget\nHuh, you must be on some new improved shit\nI get busy from sun to sun\nI'm only 21 and untouched by anyone\nNo one throws, bangs or blows\nAll foes, I keep 'em running like pantyhose\nThey get soft and tender, front and then surrender\nI turned off more lights than Teddy Pendergrass\nBring on your class, force, team or staff\nBut when I'm in effect they feel the wrath\nOf Kane", "image":

For all players, I am the speaker\nI'm also known as the hot pussy seeker\nWhen it comes down to ridin up and down in some pussy\nI make it weaker\nAlso it gets a little deeper\nI was walkin down Broadway the other day\nAn old old lady came my way\nShe said, \"I'll be glad when you 'come 18\nI'm gonna give you a funkin like you ain't never seen!\"\nI said, \"LADY! Why wait for so much time to pass?\nI've been WANTIN to tear up yo' old gray ass\"\nSo I pulled out my dick\nIt was so shiny it looked like it was painted\nThe ho took one look and damn near

Why wait for so much time to pass?\nI've been WANTIN to tear up yo' old gray ass\"\nSo I pulled out my dick\nIt was so shiny it looked like it was painted\nThe ho took one look and damn near fainted\nI stuck it in the bitch and the bitch began to shout\nThat, \"Oh Mr. Dolemite, take that motherfucker OUT!\"\n\n[Kane]\nWell you ain't sayin nothin slick to a can of oil\nI walked barefoot from New York to Dallas\nWon for Pimp of the Year at the Caesar's Palace\nMade a big snowstorm on the 4th of July\nAnd drunk the waters in the Atlantic Ocean til that shit was dry\nI was makin money before Washington was put on a bill\nAnd I kicked Jack's ass and took his ho Jill\nI'm the one who broke the bull's back\nAnd made people say FUCK McDonald's and call ME the Big Mac\n\n[Dolemite]\nWhy you long lanky motherfucker\nYou ain't nothin but a sucker!\nI was born in a barrel of butcher knives\nShot in the ass with two Colt .45's\nI've been slapped by a bear and bit by an eel\nI chew up railroad iron, and shit out steel!\nI jumped in the ocean and swallowed a whale\nHandcuff lightning and throw THUNDER's ass in jail\n\n[Kane]\nWhy you ignorant decrepit motherfucker\nLet me tell you somethin\nI'm the one that put the M in mackin\nBecause when you did it you was only actin\nI made pimpin a full time job\nSo bitches wouldn't have to go out and rob\nI made the streets of New York hot as a SAUNA\nAnd hung a Home Sweet Ho sign on every corner\nYes I'm the player of all players and the mack of all macks\nGive a headache to Excedrin and knock the SHIT out of Ex-Lax\n\n[Dolemite]\nWhy you insecure no business barn junkyard\nRat soup eatin motherfucker!!\nIt was in the early 1960's when I originated my pimpin game\nI was callin whores jives ass bitches\nAnd pimps - sucker ass lame\nKANE, before you can take my reign\nYou gotta cook me a chicken and a half a day\nWalk from New York to Los Angeles and throw the bones away\nYou gotta be BORN BLIND and cannot see\nYo' bitches have the POCKS in the ass so bad they can't even pee\nRide a bald eagle a million feet in the AIR\nAnd get out and do the runnin man while you up there\nHave the Mumps and the Asiastic Flu\nAnd the Crabs around yo' ass start singin the Yankee Doodle Doo!\n\n[Kane]\nAww fuckit I give up"}}, {"title": "Ooh, Aah, Nah-Nah-Nah", "album": "Prince of Darkness", "year": null, "lyrics": "Enquiring minds wanna know, did the champ retire\nSo here I am, boomin like an amplifier\nI clear my throat, then I float like a boat\nNote for note, what I wrote you can't quote or even tote\nRaps are too heavy, sharp like a machete\nPass the microphone, cause Kane is all ready\nGrippin to play the part to prove that I'm in command\nThe Biggest Daddy of em all, and oh, Kane stands for\nKing Asiatic, Nobody's Equal\nOr Non-Equivalent, or Natural Ebony\nOr Now Effective, or Never Ever\nPick your definition and put it together\nCause it still comes out tastin' like chocolate\nWith the finesse MCs never got with\nCause none of them want me to touch the mic first\nThey know that it only takes Kane one verse\nSo here's the microphone, show me what you can do\nAnd uhh {yawn} wake me up when you're through\nJust so I can go and flow and throw a blow\nTo show a pro and let em all know\nThat any MC trying to be this lyrical\nShould go ask Smokey Robinson for a Miracle\nI wouldn't let a rapper go one round\nI'm knockin them down, just like Jim Brown\nSo Mister Cee, let the music play\nAnd here's what I want y'all to say\n\nOoh!

own\nIt only takes one punch to get head flown\nFists of fury, suckers get buried\nCause the Kane got more spice than curry\nI am the flavor down on paper\nAnd nothing could save ya, from catchin the vapors\nRhymes that'll sting your face like a quick jab\nAnd I'm rubbin em in just like Vicks say I'm\nCaptivatin', dominatin', innovatin', illustratin', fascinatin'\nMotivatin', elevatin', terminatin', mutilatin'\nRhymes they're worth their weight in\nGold, bold, never sold to a bidder\nThat claim to glitter, you're so bitter like kitty litter\nAs for damage, don't tell me what another do\nCause I quote that I'm R-A-W\nSo make room, cause fighters are doomed\nTry to consume, and make your own tune\nA grave from a casket, a tisket a tasket\nYou're rhymes out of basket, boy you get your ass kicked\nFor frontin like you hittin hard\nWhen your arms are too short, to box with God\nSo don't even touch cause I come with too much\nAddress and bless any mic that I clutch\nAnd for a rapper to challenge my freestyle\nHe must be senile, and that's why meanwhile\nBack at the ranch...\nThere goes the asiatic chosen one that's expandin with a new branch\nSo many slept on the nonchalant act\nNow wake up sucker this is mortal combat\n\n\"you say daddy I don't want none...\" --] Kool Moe Dee\n(repeat 4X)\n\nI seize and freeze MC's with these degrees\nPut me to my knees, or at ease, chillllld please\nI break it down, to bring on the next act\nRappers are so full of shit, they need Ex-Lax\nSo stop griffin, your mind is driftin\nPrepare yourself cause I get swift and\nCaptivate the crowd but you can't understand\nAt times I gotta say to myself, \"God damn!\"\nAs I get hot, and still be gettin warmer\nAnd I don't have beef with no other performer\nKeep to myself never bother another\nBut if a rapper tries to diss I crush the motherfucker!\nFrontin MC's that be tryin to rip\nNeed to save it, and don't even play with\nMe when I react like a volcano eruptin\nI step to you and say, \"Now what's up?\" then\nEvery word'll be just like surgery\nCuttin you open so rush to emergency\nOr even bow to your knees and below\nOr get played like a game of Nintendo\nJ-O-K-E-S ain't my style\nI ain't a child that's why I don't smile\nI combine a line designed to find behind the mind\nSo devine the other rappers resign\nAs I go on, from night to morn\nBeginning to end, from Knowledge to Born\nWhenever rappers are lookin for static\nLooks like a job for King Asiatic\nAn-y, send-me, competitors\nThen again, it might just be better to\nJust slow down you don't wanna throwdown\nI get busy, get you dizzy like a merry-go-round\nFeel the wrath of a Big Daddy duel rhyme\nAnd competition, prepare for wartime\nBe alert for where I drop the bomb at\nAs I destroy you with mortal combat\n\n\"you say daddy I don't want none...\" --] Kool Moe Dee\n(repeat 4X)\n\nI roll so bold with soul control the whole patrol\nOf folders molders towin black gold\nSo let it be said, let it be read\nCause I lead ahead, of others who rhymes are old as Pro-Keds\nTryin to diss the Big Daddy repetoire\nMoi??\nYou steady screamin out a antique segment wrote\nAs I just play em like a pregant roach and STOMP EM\nFor tryin the forbidden\nYour rhymes ain't hittin, boy you won't be gettin\nNone of, or in front of, cause every one of\nMy adversaries, lack, you little son of\nO-bit-uary columns will read your name\nIf you ever try to step to the Big Daddy Kane\nSo any claimin or aimin to be champion\nAgainst me? Psssh, can't be one\nI rank supreme and it's a rapper's dream\nTo scheme and fiend for my technique but redeem\nCause there's only room for one teacher\nWise words from a wise man'll reach ya\nI teach freedom, justice, and equality\nPeace to the brothers and sisters and follow me\nPlenty poisoned minds of the people are ours\nSlaves, from mental death in power\nThat's the reason before I drop this bomb\nI say peace to the Nation of Islam\n\n(\"Make you say\" (6X) \"daddy I don't want none...\") --] Kool Moe Dee\n(\"Make you say, say, da-daddy I don't want none...\")\n(\"Make, ma-ma-make, make

they bring the drama hard\nGuliani got New York looking like it's Amistad\nBe whatever's clever, with the thought of slipping\nThugs start to flipping, black women resort to stripping\nWhen they say, the drug game's dead, that's not a fable\nHustlers is locked down or either got a label\nEither try to keep the heat on ya on the street corner\nYa sleep, a week later your peeps mourn ya\nStick up kids putting in working in Ps\nYour food stamps feed the next cat Turkey and Cheese\nAin't no devourance, I speak it now in defense\nI'm only here to make dollar, outta knowledge, power, sense\nSo be about the paper till your pockets are full\nPlease stop with the bull, less is profitable, come on...\n\n[Hook: scratched by DJ Premier]\n\"Making moves any type of way\"\n\"Straight gutter from the

another minute, ain't gon be no middle class\nWhat you think this shit will last, time to Monopolize\nStreets got lots of guys and I know we got the size\nWhat I prophesize is the way to start the rise\nCross the T's, dot the I's and we will not demise\nI come through the door, four four's to get at your's\nThe Eye of the Tiger, no I'm coming with the claws\nIt's my chance to get the finance, so why dance\nWith proper guidance to take it to the next high stance\nI'm tryin to live incredible, get dat revenue\nThinking ahead of you, that's your girl, let her through\nWhat you better do is try to chase the paper\nSociety will rape ya when you fight forces of nature\nI been walked that path before so I do feel you\nThe early bird will get the worm and drink it with Tequila\nYa heard...\n\n[Hook: scratched by DJ Premier]\n\"Making moves any type of way\"\n\"Straight gutter from the ghetto to the burb\"\n\"Take it back to the days of...\"\n\"Do or Die\"\n\"Straight from

this ghetto, your friends flip on you like Doberman's\nDat buldge in your pocket I see, you better hide\nWhile you at it, tuck that medallion inside\nForget the microphone, you need the iron we squeeze\nSo you can clap four like Siamese seals\nDistrust and greed, this was indeed\nGiven by the man's and know we living by the land\nAnd life I tackle with my soul trapped inside this Tabernacle\nThe only thing that's missing is the shackles\nDo what we gotta to enterprise with the dollar\nCreate a different aura for the children of tommorow\nTherefore I kick styles to make my

be hollering at these cats man, you know\nTrying to make them understand the realness in this here game man you know\nThis how serious it is on these streets\nYo check it, uh...\n\n[Verse 1: Big Daddy Kane]\nSurvival of the Fittest today, that's still the test\nI seen em kill the best, in this ghetto wilderness\nIt's real in the field, cause they bring the drama hard\nGuliani got New York looking like it's Amistad\nBe whatever's clever, with the thought of slipping\nThugs start to flipping, black women resort to stripping\nWhen they say, the drug game's dead, that's not a fable\nHustlers is locked down or either got a label\nEither try to keep the heat on ya on the street corner\nYa sleep, a week later your peeps mourn ya\nStick up kids putting in working in Ps\nYour food stamps feed the next cat Turkey and Cheese\nAin't no devourance, I speak it now in defense\nI'm only here to make dollar, outta knowledge, power, sense\nSo be about the paper till your pockets are full\nPlease stop with the bull, less is profitable, come on...\n\n[Hook: scratched by DJ Premier]\n\"Making moves any type of way\"\n\"Straight gutter from the ghetto to the burb\"\n\"Take it back to the days of...\"\n\"Do or Die\"\n\"Straight from Bedstuy\"\n\"Know what I'm sayin\"\n\"Making moves any type of way\"\n\"Straight gutter from the ghetto to the burb\"\n\"Put these rapper's under pressure, till they break\"\n\"Ya'll know who this is\"\n\"You know\"\n\n[Verse 2: Big Daddy Kane]\nIf you in this for the cheddar, you better get it fast\nCause in another minute, ain't gon be no middle class\nWhat you think this shit will last, time to Monopolize\nStreets got lots of guys and I know we got the size\nWhat I prophesize is the way to start the rise\nCross the T's, dot the I's and we will not demise\nI come through the door, four four's to get at your's\nThe Eye of the Tiger, no I'm coming with the claws\nIt's my chance to get the finance, so why dance\nWith proper guidance to take it to the next high stance\nI'm tryin to live incredible, get dat revenue\nThinking ahead of you, that's your girl, let her through\nWhat you better do is try to chase the paper\nSociety will rape ya when you fight forces of nature\nI been walked that path before so I do feel you\nThe early bird will get the worm and drink it with Tequila\nYa heard...\n\n[Hook: scratched by DJ Premier]\n\"Making moves any type of way\"\n\"Straight gutter from the ghetto to the burb\"\n\"Take it back to the days of...\"\n\"Do or Die\"\n\"Straight from Bedstuy\"\n\"Know what I'm sayin\"\n\"Making moves any type of

outside building with this O.G\nNever will I forget the jewels that he told me\nHe said when you holding, never show your wins\nIn this ghetto, your friends flip on you like Doberman's\nDat buldge in your pocket I see, you better hide\nWhile you at it, tuck that medallion inside\nForget the microphone, you need the iron we squeeze\nSo you can clap four like Siamese seals\nDistrust and greed, this was indeed\nGiven by the man's and know we living by the land\nAnd life I tackle with my soul trapped inside this Tabernacle\nThe only thing that's missing is the shackles\nDo what we gotta to enterprise with the dollar\nCreate a different aura for the children of tommorow\nTherefore I kick styles to make my cash\nCome to me in big piles, then I'm out like 6 fouls\nYa heard...\n\n[Hook: scratched by DJ Premier]\n\"Making moves any type of way\"\n\"Straight gutter from the ghetto to the burb\"\n\"Take it back to the days of...\"\n\"Do or Die\"\n\"Straight from Bedstuy\"\n\"Know what

hype\nNot a crab I see but such a lovely female\nAnd if looks could kill, she would be in jail\nFor raving all over with exotic beauty\nAnd to captivate her love is my only duty\nThere's not a single feature that this girl lacks\nSweetheart, you're my aphrodisiac\n\n[Big Daddy Kane: Chorus]\nYou've got me waiting for you day by day\nFantasies of you has got me drifting away\nAnd I know, a love like yours would be so hard to find\nSo I'll just keep on waiting for the day you're mine\n\n[Big Daddy Kane: Verse 2]\nNow I've talked to young girls and sophisticated ladies\nBut I swear my dear, none appear on your level baby\nMaybe, it's just me imagining\nThen again, I probably just haven't been\nWith the right female and in detail\nI'll probably never will be, girl if we fail\nCause every time I appear to be pleased\nYou know what happens?\nI just get skeezed\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Big Daddy Kane: Verse 3]\nThe girl that I admire, one that I desire\nAnd no one can stop the feelings that you inspire\nThe way that you leave me in this obsession\nWith the chambers of my heart in your possession\nWe were meant to be together, always and forever\nFor that engagement, I shall endeavor\nPray for the day that we combine\nAnd I can say for sure that you're truly mine\nIn benevolence and reverence\nAs soon as our relationship commence\nBut for now, I wait impatiently\nFor the day that you can give your all to me\n[You've got me waiting for you day by day]\nThe moment of truth is what I really should call it\nI worked so hard for it so please don't spoil it\nYeah it's a lot that I'm asking you to give me\nThat's only because I need you with me\nSide by side, hand in hand\nYou as my girl and Kane as your man\nBust it, ever since the first time that I seen her\nI wanted her to step inside my arena\nI'd be the champion of love, wear the golden glove\nAnd show you what a real man is made of\nMy feelings I'm sharing because I'm caring\nMy heart'll tell you why I am so endearing\nFor a chance at romance I would love to enhance\nI would be your man under any circumstance\nJust as long as I can say that you're my own\nYour feelings for me and mine alone\nWe can cherish every moment of the time we spent\nTry to take our love to the full extent\nThe point that I'm trying so hard to get through\nIs girl, I'm in love with you\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Big Daddy Kane: Verse 4]\nA dramatic fanatic for our relation\nCupid has me stupid with infatuation\nAnd a fashion of passion so tenderly\nWith vibes I can't describe you send to me\nThis personal attachment in which I feel\nTo you my dear, I will try to reveal\nAll over and over, I'll try and try\nBecause to see you with the next man makes me cry\nI feel that I should be the only man to side you\nCause no one can love you the way that I do\nNo one deserve the love you can give\nSo allow me to show you how I'm out to live\nWith something very special, palliative and pure\nAnd anything that you want, I can give you more\nI'll be calm and gentle, loving and sentimental\nOh so much emotion, I'm talking devotion\nCause when I get involved, I get involved so deep\nThat you would know that my love is something special to keep\nBut for now, I guess I'll be fine\nAnd keep waiting for the day that you'll be mine", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a3044a73939ccd541c13cf37d29d70bb.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist":

is hype\nNot a crab I see but such a lovely female\nAnd if looks could kill, she would be in jail\nFor raving all over with exotic beauty\nAnd to captivate her love is my only duty\nThere's not a single feature that this girl lacks\nSweetheart, you're my aphrodisiac\n\n[Big Daddy Kane: Chorus]\nYou've got me waiting for you day by day\nFantasies of you has got me drifting away\nAnd I know, a love like yours would be so hard to find\nSo I'll just keep on waiting for the day you're mine\n\n[Big Daddy Kane: Verse 2]\nNow I've talked to young girls and sophisticated ladies\nBut I swear my dear, none appear on your level baby\nMaybe, it's just me imagining\nThen again, I probably just haven't been\nWith the right female and in detail\nI'll probably never will be, girl if we fail\nCause every time I appear to be pleased\nYou know what happens?\nI just get skeezed\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Big Daddy Kane: Verse 3]\nThe girl that I admire, one that I desire\nAnd no one can stop the feelings that you inspire\nThe way that you leave me in this obsession\nWith the chambers of my heart in your possession\nWe were meant to be together, always and forever\nFor that engagement, I shall endeavor\nPray for the day that we combine\nAnd I can say for sure that you're truly mine\nIn benevolence and reverence\nAs soon as our relationship commence\nBut for now, I wait impatiently\nFor the day that you can give your all to me\n[You've got me waiting for you day by day]\nThe moment of truth is what I really should call it\nI worked so hard for it so please don't spoil it\nYeah it's a lot that I'm asking you to give me\nThat's only because I need you with me\nSide by side, hand in hand\nYou as my girl and Kane as your man\nBust it, ever since the first time that I seen her\nI wanted her to step inside my arena\nI'd be the champion of love, wear the golden glove\nAnd show you what a real man is made of\nMy feelings I'm sharing because I'm caring\nMy heart'll tell you why I am so endearing\nFor a chance at romance I would love to enhance\nI would be your man under any circumstance\nJust as long as I can say that you're my own\nYour feelings for me and mine alone\nWe can cherish every moment of the time we spent\nTry to take our love to the full extent\nThe point that I'm trying so hard to get through\nIs girl, I'm in love with you\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Big Daddy Kane: Verse 4]\nA dramatic fanatic for our relation\nCupid has me stupid with infatuation\nAnd a fashion of passion so tenderly\nWith vibes I can't describe you send to me\nThis personal attachment in which I feel\nTo you my dear, I will try to reveal\nAll over and over, I'll try and try\nBecause to see you with the next man makes me cry\nI feel that I should be the only man to side you\nCause no one can love you the way that I do\nNo one deserve the love you can give\nSo allow me to show you how I'm out to live\nWith something very special, palliative and pure\nAnd anything that you want, I can give you more\nI'll be calm and gentle, loving and sentimental\nOh so much emotion, I'm talking devotion\nCause when I get involved, I get involved so deep\nThat you would know that my love is something special to keep\nBut for now, I guess I'll be fine\nAnd keep waiting for the day that you'll be mine"}}, {"title": "Cause I Can Do it Right", "album": "Taste of Chocolate", "year": "1990-10-30", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nMove over bacon there's something meatier\nA natural born lover with love to give free to ya\nMeatier, so all you bacon lovers move over\nCause I'm so smooth they should call me Blackanova\nI'm not tryin' to say that I'm number one\nI'm just a smooth operator that gets the job done\nSo, let me lick you from head to toe\nRealllllllll slowwwwwwwww\nCause ever since I was young I could keep girls sprung\nJust by the movement of my tongue\nI remember it all started way back\nIn ummm... Kindergarten!!\nSome played with Legos, some played with Play-Doh\nBut I was feelin' girls like a ripe tomato\nAnd now it's 1990 and you can find me as I dunk\nLockin' up girls like I want\nYes I got a harem, but I don't share em\nI collect em like per diem and MMM, you gotta see em\nBecause the ladies is all I dream of\nAnd not even Anita Baker can give sweeter love\nYou know why?\n\nCause I can do it right (4X)\nYesssss I can!\n\n[Verse 2]\nStep up girls and get somethin' to treasure\nAnd welcome to the Smooth Operator's Palace of Pleasure\nAnd if you're wondering if I want it --\nI got a Craftmatic with your name written on it\nI reminisce saying I take em eight to eighty\nBut I was just kiddin', no you have to be a lady\nEven if you're too young, with the hypest body\nI just don't go to a Similac party\nSo all those of age, we can get intimate\nBumper to bumper, so you can get your fender bent\nI treat girls just like pastry\nMmmmmmmmm *smacks lips* Tasty!\nVery kinky when it comes to hanky panky\nA well known player, but not for the Yankees\nI won't say I'm the baddest or portray that role\nBut I'm of the top two, and my father's gettin' old\nI'm taking love to a brand new height\nAnd if loving girls is wrong I don't wanna be right\nCause my man Babyface said that it's no crime\nAnd of course I'll work Diana Ross overtime\nYou know why?\n\nCause I can do it right (4X)\nYesssss I can!\n\n[Verse 3]\nIf I was on the movies I'd frame Roger Rabbit\nPlay Spike Lee with Jessica, because she's gotta have it\nBut I'm not an actor, I'm just a mack\nThat charms girls as I whisper sweet nothings to attract her\nAnd bring about that feeling of passion\nTo have her on my body like modern day fashion\nLayin' next to me, in pure ecstasy\nYou're like a door and you know that sex the key\nSo send your man to the lost and found\nI'm bringing something that's world renowned\nIn other words - good lovin' that's major\nI got girls in more areas than a SkyPager\nRunning around saying, \"Please me, please me, please me\"\nThat's why I say it ain't easy\nBut I've been able to maintain my status\nWith ladies macking without if's, and's, or maybe's\nAnd other players just can't understand it\nAnd couldn't keep they girls even if they were branded\nI always end up with them on my shelf\n*SMACK* I gotta jump back and kiss myself\nYou know why?\n\nCause I can do it right (4X)\nYesssss I can!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/065deb6c8193ec3f78eae34a4581ad24.397x400x1.jpg", "artist": "Big Daddy Kane", "raw": {"annotation_count": 10, "api_path":

meatier\nA natural born lover with love to give free to ya\nMeatier, so all you bacon lovers move over\nCause I'm so smooth they should call me Blackanova\nI'm not tryin' to say that I'm number one\nI'm just a smooth operator that gets the job done\nSo, let me lick you from head to toe\nRealllllllll slowwwwwwwww\nCause ever since I was young I could keep girls sprung\nJust by the movement of my tongue\nI remember it all started way back\nIn ummm... Kindergarten!!\nSome played with Legos, some played with Play-Doh\nBut I was feelin' girls like a ripe tomato\nAnd now it's 1990 and you can find me as I dunk\nLockin' up girls like I want\nYes I got a harem, but I don't share em\nI collect em like per diem and MMM, you gotta see em\nBecause the ladies is all I dream of\nAnd not even Anita Baker can give sweeter love\nYou know why?\n\nCause I can do it right (4X)\nYesssss I can!\n\n[Verse 2]\nStep up girls and get somethin' to treasure\nAnd welcome to the Smooth Operator's Palace of Pleasure\nAnd if you're wondering if I want it --\nI got a Craftmatic with your name written on it\nI reminisce saying I take em eight to eighty\nBut I was just kiddin', no you have to be a lady\nEven if you're too young, with the hypest body\nI just don't go to a Similac party\nSo all those of age, we can get intimate\nBumper to bumper, so you can get your fender bent\nI treat girls just like pastry\nMmmmmmmmm *smacks lips* Tasty!\nVery kinky when it comes to hanky panky\nA well known player, but not for the Yankees\nI won't say I'm the baddest or portray that role\nBut I'm of the top two, and my father's gettin' old\nI'm taking love to a brand new height\nAnd if loving girls is wrong I don't wanna be right\nCause my man Babyface said that it's no crime\nAnd of course I'll work Diana Ross overtime\nYou know why?\n\nCause I can do it right (4X)\nYesssss I can!\n\n[Verse 3]\nIf I was on the movies I'd frame Roger Rabbit\nPlay Spike Lee with Jessica, because she's gotta have it\nBut I'm not an actor, I'm just a mack\nThat charms girls as I whisper sweet nothings to attract her\nAnd bring about that feeling of passion\nTo have her on my body like modern day fashion\nLayin' next to me, in pure ecstasy\nYou're like a door and you know that sex the key\nSo send your man to the lost and found\nI'm bringing something that's world renowned\nIn other words - good lovin' that's major\nI got girls in more areas than a SkyPager\nRunning around saying, \"Please me, please me, please me\"\nThat's why I say it ain't easy\nBut I've been able to maintain my status\nWith ladies macking without if's, and's, or maybe's\nAnd other players just can't understand it\nAnd couldn't keep they girls even if they were branded\nI always end up with them on my shelf\n*SMACK* I gotta jump back and kiss myself\nYou know why?\n\nCause I can do it right (4X)\nYesssss I can!"}}, {"title": "'Nuff Respect (Remix)", "album": "Looks Like a Job For...", "year": "1993-05-25", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nEnter the dragon\nAs I start, to braggin' and taggin'\nAnd sayin' I'm baggin' all rappers on the bandwagon\nFeel the fury of a renegade, well men I slayed\nSo send the aid, cause I penetrate\nBein' the best up, with lyrics I dress up, so don't even mess up\nOr try to press up, it's better to fess up\nCause if a rapper ever goes too far, man\nI start to screamin' on MCs like Tarzan\nSo witness the glare when I appear\nNone'll compare, so take a seat in the rear\nChild, you gotta understand, you just the man\nSittin' next to the man, sittin' next to the man, sittin' next to the man\nAnd no one friar comes higher than the messiah\nSparkin' the mic like a live wire till I retire\nWhatever the comp is I burn 'em like fire\nWith all the blow, I hit em hard like ...

I got my man Scoob Lover on the side of me, DJ Mister Cee on the wheels of steel, Dre on\nThe film and Marley on the boards. We gonna do a little something like this:\n\n[Big Daddy Kane, Scoob Lover & both]\nSome like it hard and some like it soft\nYo, bust the groove as I set it off\nBut wait a minute...\nYo Scoob, what's up?\nPardon me a moment as I interrupt\nFor what?\nFor this:\n\nYou like the stylish clothes we wear\nAnd you like our flat-top style of hair\nIt's just those bugged out things we do\nThat make the girlies wanna stare\n\nLike when we're chillin' with the crew\nOr drinkin' that Old English brew\nStraight from the bottle not the cup\nAnd it gets us more than just fucked uuuuup...\nAnd I like it yall..\n..like it yall...\nLike it yall...\n...like it yall\nScoob Lover, won't you hype it yall?\nWell, I'm the S-C double-O B-L-O-V-E-R- uh\nLadies come to me, I'll be your midnight horror\nNeed a flat top? Come to Scoob, I'm the barber\nOf Da Ville\nAnd that's right\nTry to step to us, watch what you get\nCuz me and Big Daddy's not havin' it\nWell, it's the Big Daddy, so all hail\nSave your wack rhymes, hold your female\nPass the Old Gold, trash the ale\nCash your food stamps, get the WIC out the mail\nLove to eat shrimps, but I never eat snail\nEat a whole fish except for the tail\nKeep food in the fridge so it don't get stale\nAnd when there's nothing to eat, I bite my nails\nSo Scoob Lover, you know your rhymes are kickin'\nGet on the mic, cuz you know you eat chicken\nNow-now-now, I'm-a place a order for a Scooby snack\nNot at the Chinese restaurant because I don't eat cats\nNow who in the world can ever eat these?\nWhen I'm at home, I chow down with ease\nAnd say \"More beef sausage, mom, please?\"\nThat's right, Mommy Dukes, she feeds me swell\nCoffee on the table, orange juice as well\nSome of the things I say are outspoken\nGuaranteed to have you chokin'\nBitin' MCs are the one I'm yokin'\nKane, I'm outta here, I guess I'll use my token\nI'll walk through the gate if the turnstile's broken\nBig Daddy, if you're down with me\nGet on the mic on the count of three;\nOne, two, three...\nNow I'm a black brother that's out to succeed\nSo step aside as I take the lead\nSexy young ladies of a light-skinned breed\n\"You got-you got-you got what I need!\"\nOutstanding, kind, cool and loyal\nDrove all the way to Maaco just to change my oil\nCuz I'm the only child, you might think I'm spoiled\nTouch the young ladies make their blood pressure boil\nI got the ...hmm...hiccups, excuse me, sorry\nScore a 100 Gs every time I play Atari\nPut a hole in the Old Gold, blast the Bacardi\nOn the dance floor, hype moves I be freakin'\nMakin' new steps up every single weekend\nNot Abbot and Costello or Laurel and Hardy\nI'm only here to PAR-TY!\n\nYo, check it out, check it out. Turn the music down, turn the music down\nTurn the music down...here we go, here we go...\n\nWe gonna end it like this in the place yall\nIt's like this yall, and you don't stop\nNow, the name Kane is superior to many people;\nIt means King Asiatic Nobody's Equal\nI hate to brag, but damn I'm good!\nAnd if mics were a gun, I'd be Clint Eastwood\nAnd if rap was a game, I'd be MVP:\nMost Valuable Poet on the M-I-C\nAnd if rap was a school, I'd be the principal\nAw fuck it, the Kane is invincible\nTo be specific, I may die one day\nBut my rhymes will remain like a hieroglyphic\nIt's a certain special skill, that takes much practice\nI got it good; apparently you lack this\nSo in turn, sit back and learn\nListen close, this is for your own concern\nLet me show ya, exactly how it's properly done:\nLights, Camera, Action!

sleep\nI write raps, ready to rip and rock real rough rhymes\nRun in rugged and raw, rapidly ruinin' roaches\nPoint blank, I spell murder to a bum\nAll you backwards rappers: REDRUM, REDRUM!\nCause I do em somethin awful, break em down to a morsel\nMakin sure that you're no longer adorable\nRappers get so quiet when I'm comin', that if they\nShitted a dictionary, you couldn't get a word from em\nIt's sort of a tradition in Bed-Stuy to do or die\nSo steppin to me is suicide\nI couldn't think of a rapper takin' mines\nI feel like Ali, \"I'm the greatest of all times\"\nFloatin' like a

blastin'\nUh, I keep the body count massive\nBut if you say you increased the Body Count troop\nYou must admit that you joined Ice-T's group\nCause you ain't hurtin' niggedy nuthin', so why you

Omega\nArm-Leg-uh-Leg-uh-Arm-Head, stayin' raw til I'm dead\nAnd to battle me you shouldn't even try\nCause with wings on your tongue, you still couldn't say nothin' fly\nAnd I don't care if you bring a crew\nAnd I don't even care if someone else writes for you\nMan, you could even be someone the crowd may just like but shoot\nYou couldn't see me with a bifocal mic\nCheck my resume, Rapmasters, Word Up!\nYo! MTV, BET, The Box and all that good stuff\nAnd Billboard for my five year duration\nAnd see that I got more spots than a dalmatian\nLet's get down to finish this large\nYou could bring on your whole

rhymes for me to say?\nWell you're god damn right you should\nCause my rhymes are like spandex, they make any ass seem good\nSo act like you know Baby Pop\nWhen I riggedy rock the higgedy hip-hop non stop, as I\nFreak the funk and flip the flavor to flow with the flyest\nA fury full force in the flames of the fire, now\nMay these MC's rest in peace\nBecause when I come to town, the population

allow it to trap\nYour body and soul so that you can adapt\nTo the man on display as I take you away\nSo may I?\n[Yes you may!]\nProud to be a Black man\nComing exact and\nGiving up to brothers five on the back hand\nPray for lease and peace upon each other\nWith my sisters and brothers\n[Marley Marl: yo, word to the mother!]\nI say the mother, as in the motherland\nBut on the other hand, another man\nTackled and shackled our ancestors\nBut we beat him with freedom, so let's bless the\nCountry that we all came from\nBecause the moral of it all is we shall overcome\nThe cream will keep rising\nWe be sizing\nUp, the Asiatic one is enterprising\nBuilding and building to carry on\nAll the way from Malcolm X to Farrakhan\nMartin Luther was a tutor, many were pupils\nThose who fell victim were those without scruples\nHowever, to sever, we could never\nSo hold up the peace sign and stand together\nTake heed to the words that I manifest\nAnd when I'm through speaking, Marley Marl'll do the rest\n\n[Break]\n[James Brown getting cut up:\nPeople, people\nWe gotta get over, before we go under (x2)\nLet's get together] (x2)\n[Marley Marl?:\nYo Big Daddy, what you gonna say

slavery\nLike the name of Antonio was gave to me\nBut knowledge of self broke every shackle and chain\nNow I declare myself as the Big Daddy Kane\nThe teacher, teaching a lesson to be heard\nThat's word, to the mother my brother\nSo discover the truth of one another\nCause here's the real deal upon our skin color\nLay down white, yellow, red or pink\nBut the color of black is most dominant\nThe

I?\n[Yes you may!]\nProud to be a Black man\nComing exact and\nGiving up to brothers five on the back hand\nPray for lease and peace upon each other\nWith my sisters and brothers\n[Marley Marl: yo, word to the mother!]\nI say the mother, as in the motherland\nBut on the other hand, another man\nTackled and shackled our ancestors\nBut we beat him with freedom, so let's bless the\nCountry that we all came from\nBecause the moral of it all is we shall overcome\nThe cream will keep rising\nWe be sizing\nUp, the Asiatic one is enterprising\nBuilding and building to carry on\nAll the way from Malcolm X to Farrakhan\nMartin Luther was a tutor, many were pupils\nThose who fell victim were those without scruples\nHowever, to sever, we could never\nSo hold up the peace sign and stand together\nTake heed to the words that I manifest\nAnd when I'm through speaking, Marley Marl'll do the rest\n\n[Break]\n[James Brown getting cut up:\nPeople, people\nWe gotta get over, before we go under (x2)\nLet's get together] (x2)\n[Marley Marl?:\nYo Big Daddy, what you gonna say now?]\n\n[Verse 2]\nTake a stand the fight for power\nCause we've been here before the Mayflower\nLiving superior abiding by nature\nThe history of the Asiatic one paid the\nPrice to be paid in slavery\nLike the name of Antonio was gave to me\nBut knowledge of self broke every shackle and chain\nNow I declare myself as the Big Daddy Kane\nThe teacher, teaching a lesson to be heard\nThat's word, to the mother my brother\nSo discover the truth of one another\nCause here's the real deal upon our skin color\nLay down white, yellow, red or pink\nBut the color of black is most dominant\nThe rising and sizing can never cease\n[Marley Marl: what you going say now?]\nPeace!\n\n[Farrakhan: ...the mother of all living things and the Black man\nIs the original man, we just can't escape our destiny]\n\n[Word to the mother!] (x2)\n\n[Farrakhan: I thank Allah for allowing me to teach this subject

we livin\nLike a turkey on Thanksgiving or like Robin Givens?\nNot to offend\nI just want you to comprehend every message I send (tell 'em)\nCause I don't understand, I have to wonder, damn\nHow could this lifestyle be fun to man\nTo see a brother gettin' paid undercover\nSellin' drugs to one another\nCause all the glamour you get is miscellaneous\nAnd all the product you sell is real dangerous\nLike um, um, let's say, um, poison\nDestruction to all your own boys and\nGirls who like to buy and give it a try\nAdmire and can't deny the high, that's why they soon die\nThese are the games that a fool would play today\nFor our own kind to decay\nNo sign of brotherly love\nJust scavengers in search of\n\n[Hook]\nAnother victory\nAnother victory\nAnother victory\nAnother victory\nAnother victory\nAnother victory\nAnother victory\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen I'm cruisin' in my Volvo, cops harass me\nThey never ride past me, they hound me like Lassie\nWantin' to give me a summons or a ticket\nHuh, I got a place for them to stick it (kick it)\nThey can't understand to see a black man\nDrivin' a car that costs twenty-five grand\nThe first thing they say is \"Where'd you steal her?\"\nAnd then they assume that I'm a drug dealer\nHuh, that just makes me wanna laugh\nCause now I'm a star and your son got my autograph\nSo all the cops on the highway gettin' me\nMy name ain't Keith, so could you please stop sweatin' me\nSo I can flow and go on, so on, and so on\nTo all the jams Cee throw on\nReachin' a summit as you learn from it\nA lesson taught from yours truly, so here cometh\nThe royal majesty, others have to be\nFully prepared, though they still won't last with me\nSo when you hope to hang or even handle\nI'll show the meaning of power and just cancel (period)\nOut of order, conquer and slaughter\nYou're comin' up shorter, boy, you'll need more to\nCompete cause the heat is deep in concrete\nDefeat, bring up the fleet, flee 'fore we meet\nOr stay away, puttin' new rhymes on layaway\nThen come get this when you're ready for business\nCause ah yeah, I'm with this (I'm ready)\nYo, Mister Cee, what is this?\n\n[Hook]\nAnother victory\nAnother victory\nAnother victory\nAnother victory\nAnother victory\nAnother victory\nAnother victory\nAnother victory\n\n[Verse 3]\nMC's and enemies, I freeze at thirty-two degrees\nBecause they can't drop rhymes like these\nCompetition never saw none done\nSo pay attention as I mention the 411\nJust the other day, I heard a brother say\n\"Taxi cabs don't even come my way\nThey all be afraid they won't get paid\nSo they zoom right past and pick up a lighter shade\nAnd if they stop, the first thing they want\nNo more than two people and the money upfront\nTreatin' me like I'm some type of thug\nIt might sound bugged but they don't wanna get mugged\"\nWho's in the right or wrong? It's time to unite along\nThe righteous with a walk in success and be strong\nInstead of lookin' for someone to beef with\nA brother like the Big Daddy Kane is peace with\nRappers of today like (Kid'N'Play)\nHey, even my man LL Cool J\n(Stetsasonic) and EPMD\nPublic Enemy and (BDP)\nSalt 'N' Pepa cause we can't sever, never\nWhether, whatever, we better stand together\nThat means unite, not fightin' or fussin' or cussin'\nSave all the base for the pipe and start lovin'\nOne another cause separation is a flaw\nSo endure for more and stop lookin' for\n\n[Hook]\nAnother victory\nAnother victory\nAnother victory\nAnother victory\nAnother victory\nAnother victory\nAnother victory\nAnother victory\nAnother victory", "image":

head\n\n[Scoob]\nWell is it Brownsville? Time to represent for the map\nWhere the peeps smoke blunts and like to wear mad gold caps\nThe party addict about to explode\nFrom the 1-1-2, the double-3 ill zip code\n\n[Big Daddy Kane]\nParlayin on the corner, drinkin 40's shootin cee-lo\nIt's a Brooklyn thing, aight? You know our steelo\nAnd for those who just don't know how it go\nPlay like a substitute teacher and ACT like you know\n\n[Scoob]\nSo yo, who wanna set it? You better kick your best G\nYou and your whole entourage couldn't test me\nI represent for the fo' main\nAnd if you're not a booty bandit, then niggas can't hang\n\nChorus\n\n[Big Daddy Kane]\nNow, let's get straight down to the point\nI represent for this Brooklyn joint, baby pah, where we're takin it to\nMakin a few dollars don't mean you gotta forget\nWhere you come from and try to be someone, that you're really not\nAnd front with what you got\nYou're gonna be looked at as a black man still so keep it real\nWhat type of mission can I say you on?\nBecause you musta done changed to some Grey Poupon, heh\nI'm really happy to see you blew up\nBut always remember my man you grew up\nIn the PJ's all your life, in a broken home\n(Scoob: Well alright now)\nUp in the PJ's all your life, keepin it strong, WHAT!\nI be the Louis Ave livin, live long lastin lover\nBonafied black brother, word to the mother\nSkilled at trades at hand with those who made\nThe man with support and always stayed a fan\nMy dialectic style is perfected\nIn ways you can't imagine rap bein accepted\nFunk'll slam like a doper jam, pops\nI'm takin mine like taxes with Uncle Sam\nSo check out the asiatic type of flow\nLike water in the Nile, but it's Brooklyn style\n\nChorus\n\n[Scoob]\nYo, this is Big Scoob, no practice\nI'm flippin on niggas like little kids on that mattress\nYou know my style, Baby Pah from the PJ's\nMy lyrics so dope, they too fat for local DJ's\nSo hear me out, no doubt, no need for screamin\nMy boys in the back, clockin your jewels, and they scheamin\nWhy did they step to me, I hit em, bow, bu-dow\nKnocked out his fronts cause the kid was mad fragile\nNo need for beef chief I'm rollin mad deep\nSo pick up your teeth, I got him shakin like a leaf\nNot tryin to scare you, I just wanna aware you\nI bet you won't even look at my face (WHAT WHAT WHAT) I dare you\nYo nigga please, yo I'm nice with these\nWhile you're guardin your grill, I'll be beatin up your kidneys\nMe and my boys with the fat tec 9's\nWith my joint cocked back, in case a punk tried to take mines\nWhere I'm from there's no need for hesitation\nWe cock and squeeze, now where's the doctor for this patient?\nHe's drippin blood and now he's down to his last breath\nBut he won't make it, cause he knows that my joint is def\nThe ill, type of Brooklyn artist\nWho rocks the har-dest, regard-less\nWho you know and where you're from I pull your file\n(How?)

as a Lamborghini, smooth as a Lexus\nI guess that makes me the top of the line\nOh yes I'm the most prime of all time\nCause as soon as I pick up the mic and begin and the lyrics just start\nTo flowing, ahem ahem, coughing couldn't stop me from going\nOn with the rapture, so that I can capture\nYour mind with state of the art music made to adapt to\nTo knowledge the God on the groove\nBecause when my tongue moves I just love that I'm smooth\nDo it with these and in times I leave reas (reason)\nTo give em a little of the flavor that please\nAs I, school in the who in pursuin and doin and reignin again and the\nGutter and stutter and killin and chillin collectin the rent and\nJammin and slammin and damn it's\nToo much for one mind to comprehend\nA pure blend, the way that I make words mend\nAnd, the way that I be doin rappers in\nMichael Bivins couldn't make these Boyz II Men\nI play, somethin verbally, capable to murder the\nAverage MC, the tough ones I'll burn third degree\nAnd if you're thinkin that I'm takin a beatin\nYou're sure to see the Pink Panther speakin\n\n[Verse Two: Q-Tip]\nI'm a native New Yorker, I pitch a lot of porker\nWhen I get my ride, I be the grill squawker\nTip's a smooth talker, I love Alice Walker\nSo get off the dillz and step back you little hawker\nBetter yet you hooker, you wanna show I book ya\nThe highest way I took ya, is youse a good looker\nQueens is residential, I make the presidentials\nOver instrumentals, I utilize the mentals\nFirst saw Big Daddy at the place called Union Square\nIf you went in by yourself it was a terror\nSee, I could do that cause my crew is kinda phat\nOutside we had the toolies, out West you call em gats\nIt's that, oh thanks chat, well let me drop some more shit\nBring your bats and balls and please don't forfeit\nCause you won't get away, your status will be stank\nYou can ride with me G I'm goin to the bank\nTo meet up with Kane, up on Dollar Lane\nYou get the idea, cause page times is near\nSo rappers see they bug cause they really can't handle\nPosition from the rappin, cause some of them be slackin\nNot in this sport of thought we block out the devil\nThe three different flavors, you know we on the level\n\n[Verse Three: Busta Rhymes]\nCheck it out, uhh! As I come down and get dumb\nYes roughneck, swingin along with the drum\nSwimmin in the, track, retaliatin thorough is how\nI react, Busta Rhymes will attack\nAs you feel the pain, bass kick impacts to the brain\nGotta make a mega migraine\nWhattup? To the Big Daddy and Tip\nMy trip, flip the rhyme, then I dip\nHey, hip-hop, cool, bust the interlude\nWack do ya on the stage gettin booed\nThis structure it takes, bust the angle of three different flavors\nOn a young raider choc well that's my vocal fader\nKeep my volume on extra boom!\nAll the vains in my neck symbolizes that I want room\nWord up, huh! Here I am, damn\nDragon slayer stackin layer after layer\nThis jam will be ran while the record flim flam\nWiggle your front pram, to the runnin man\nSam, Busta, Rhymes, comin on time\nL.O.N.S. did, rip a new design\nFlavor one, taste the unborn baby\nFlip before you move or catch a bad one baby\nChiggy change chump, the over sized puff\nBusta pump you and the love, and then I rump\nEmotional stare point, for the wild\nBusta buckwild musically direct from Strong Isle\nUnload, catch you like smell later\nDig on your taste of the third flavor, rrrarrrRHHH\nRARRARRRRH! Direct from the lungs of the dragon, uh!"}}, {"title": "It's a Big Daddy Thing", "album": "It's a Big Daddy Thing", "year": "1989-09-19", "lyrics": "[Movie Dialogue]\n\"Dr. Harrah, is Mr. Kane loose in this hospital?\"\n\"In the morgue I think, doctor.\"\n[Sigh] \"I specifically told Dr. Riley to suspend him!\"\n\n[Intro]\nAhh yeah\nWe gon' pump this up one time\nAs we set it off a little like this, kick it!\n\nPump it up now (it's a Big Daddy thing)\nAs we send this out to New York City\nCan't forget the posse down in Philly\nAlso in Detroit (it's a Big Daddy thing)\nChicago, Atlanta GA\nSendin' this out to Miami (it's a Big Daddy thing)\nTampa, can't forget Virginia and North Carolina\nL.A. and Oakland (it's a Big Daddy thing)\nAnd the rest of the world as we go a little somethin' like this\n(it's a Big Daddy thing)\n\n[Verse One]\nLet it rain, let it rain, to be put it pain\nWith nothin' to gain under the Wrath of Kane\nCause you can't maintain, I drained every brain\nTo leave a stain plain to remain in my lane\nOr path or road, until the next episode\nLet the B-I-G, D-A-double-D-Y explode\nJust like a bomb in Vietnam, so hit the alarm\nOr be funky like a underarm\nAnd allow me to show how the microphone should flow\nNow, competition bow, to me like a Buddha\nThe teacher, the tutor\nThey come a dime a dozen but the Kane look cuter\nAnd I ain't about that slouchin' or crabbin'\nSo save it -- cause that's one thing I ain't havin'\nBecause the purpose I serve is to please ya\nRhymes will ease ya, like Milk of Magnesia\nSo bust a pimp without a limp\nAnd I crush any wimp that would try to attempt to umm\nGet loose, now put a boost and used to chill\nThe comp to Kane, I picked Beetlejuice\n\n\"Big Daddy thing\" (2X)\n\n[Verse Two]\nI'm just that ruthless, to leave ya toothless\nCause you're useless, makin up excuses, excuses\nSo never touch, tap, tangle or tamper\nA fearless fly foe'll get slapped with a Pamper\nCause I can dig in your face like root canal\nBut I'mma chill, won't even dispute you now\nActin wild just ain't my style\nCause only the live will be movin the crowd but see\nQuiet as kept, not like a star to you\nBut I can roast an MC like a barbecue\nIn the Dead Zone, you shouldn't have left home\nSteppin' to the man, now get the head flown\nI bring the terror, horror, there's no tomorrow\nChild you shouldn't even bother\nTo press up, and get broken like a Lee nail\nSo let me school ya plus scoop your female\nJust like a jiggalo but I'm much bigger though\nI'm like a hitman, pullin the trigger slow\nAnd smooth to the groove with lyrics that soothe\nAnd improve with every move, that's why you've\nBeen enhanced by the mentally divine\nSo play football, and let's go the nine\nShorts I take none, cause I ain't the one\nIn '89 there's damage being done\nAnd for you to diss me, will be very risky\nCause I make this be, as strong as whiskey\nTo break and make my foes dispose and fall\nSo y'all can see how me the Kane will just reign\nSuperior, cause I ain't even hearin' ya\nSave the yang, cause it's a Big Daddy thang\n\n\"Big Daddy thing\" (4X, then cut and scratched to end)\n\n[Outro]\nAnd this one here goes out to my man Mad Money Murph\nCan't forget Big Sha, Big Therm\nAnd also I got to say whassup to my man Horace\nGot Nice and Smooth in the place to be\nMack Daddy Nick, know what I'm sayin?\nCan't forget my man Ant Live\nAnd of course the one and only Prince Paul, peace!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e5112b31d8bd715b9e736175eff672d9.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Big Daddy

doctor.\"\n[Sigh] \"I specifically told Dr. Riley to suspend him!\"\n\n[Intro]\nAhh yeah\nWe gon' pump this up one time\nAs we set it off a little like this, kick it!\n\nPump it up now (it's a Big Daddy thing)\nAs we send this out to New York City\nCan't forget the posse down in Philly\nAlso in Detroit (it's a Big Daddy thing)\nChicago, Atlanta GA\nSendin' this out to Miami (it's a Big Daddy thing)\nTampa, can't forget Virginia and North Carolina\nL.A. and Oakland (it's a Big Daddy thing)\nAnd the rest of the world as we go a little somethin' like this\n(it's a Big Daddy thing)\n\n[Verse One]\nLet it rain, let it rain, to be put it pain\nWith nothin' to gain under the Wrath of Kane\nCause you can't maintain, I drained every brain\nTo leave a stain plain to remain in my lane\nOr path or road, until the next episode\nLet the B-I-G, D-A-double-D-Y explode\nJust like a bomb in Vietnam, so hit the alarm\nOr be funky like a underarm\nAnd allow me to show how the microphone should flow\nNow, competition bow, to me like a Buddha\nThe teacher, the tutor\nThey come a dime a dozen but the Kane look cuter\nAnd I ain't about that slouchin' or crabbin'\nSo save it -- cause that's one thing I ain't havin'\nBecause the purpose I serve is to please ya\nRhymes will ease ya, like Milk of Magnesia\nSo bust a pimp without a limp\nAnd I crush any wimp that would try to attempt to umm\nGet loose, now put a boost and used to chill\nThe comp to Kane, I picked Beetlejuice\n\n\"Big Daddy thing\" (2X)\n\n[Verse Two]\nI'm just that ruthless, to leave ya toothless\nCause you're useless, makin up excuses, excuses\nSo never touch, tap, tangle or tamper\nA fearless fly foe'll get slapped with a Pamper\nCause I can dig in your face like root canal\nBut I'mma chill, won't even dispute you now\nActin wild just ain't my style\nCause only the live will be movin the crowd but see\nQuiet as kept, not like a star to you\nBut I can roast an MC like a barbecue\nIn the Dead Zone, you shouldn't have left home\nSteppin' to the man, now get the head flown\nI bring the terror, horror, there's no tomorrow\nChild you shouldn't even bother\nTo press up, and get broken like a Lee nail\nSo let me school ya plus scoop your female\nJust like a jiggalo but I'm much bigger though\nI'm like a hitman, pullin the trigger slow\nAnd smooth to the groove with lyrics that soothe\nAnd improve with every move, that's why you've\nBeen enhanced by the mentally divine\nSo play football, and let's go the nine\nShorts I take none, cause I ain't the one\nIn '89 there's damage being done\nAnd for you to diss me, will be very risky\nCause I make this be, as strong as whiskey\nTo break and make my foes dispose and fall\nSo y'all can see how me the Kane will just reign\nSuperior, cause I ain't even hearin' ya\nSave the yang, cause it's a Big Daddy thang\n\n\"Big Daddy thing\" (4X, then cut and scratched to end)\n\n[Outro]\nAnd this one here goes out to my man Mad Money Murph\nCan't forget Big Sha, Big Therm\nAnd also I got to say whassup to my man Horace\nGot Nice and Smooth in the place to be\nMack Daddy Nick, know what I'm sayin?\nCan't forget my man Ant Live\nAnd of course the one and only Prince Paul, peace!"}}, {"title": "Brother, Brother", "album": "Prince of Darkness", "year": null, "lyrics": "[Big Daddy Kane]\nMmmhmm.. right, right\nWhat we have here.. is a collaboration\nOf the Big Daddy Kane.. and the Little Daddy Shane\nWe're gonna send this out to.. all the brothers\nAnd sisters, around the universe\nIt's a tune.. a tune about unity..\nAnd peace amongst each other\nAnd we're gonna have some fun, peep this\n\nThe B-to-the-I-to-the-G-to-the-D\nTo-the-A-to-the-D-to-the-D-to-the-Y\nTo-the-K-to-the-A-to-the-N-to-the-E\nThe Smooth Operator's in the place to be\n\n[Little Daddy Shane]\nThe L-to-the-I-to-the-L-to-the-D\nTo-the-A-to-the-D-to-the-D-to-the-Y\nTo-the-S-to-the-H-to-the-A-N-E\nThe Little Daddy Shane for the world to see\n\nRikki Tembo, no Sa Rembo\nItalian men, call their girls a bimbo\nPuerto Rican men call their girls muchacha\nAsk me how I know, cause I'm a girl watcher!\n\n[Big Daddy Kane]\nNow I must admit that I'm a sensitive guy\nCause I cried on Cooley High when Cochise died\nBut then again at times I may be a mean fellow\nCause I didn't give a damn about the dog Old Yeller\n\nBut I love my brother (and I love him back)\nI wish people of the world could be like that\nSo shake shake y'all (shake y'all) shake y'all (shake y'all)\nAND BUST THE MOVE WE MAKE Y'ALL\n\n[Chorus]\nBrother, brother.. help each other [repeat 2X]\n\n[Little Daddy Shane]\nI'm not Don Pardo, or Guy Lombardo\nI Love Lucy, but I'm not Ricky Ricardo\nI'm just a teen titan, that does some mean fightin\nAgainst any sucker MC that's seen bitin\n\n[Big Daddy Kane]\nI been through Different World's, gave them all a try\nKadeem is my man, but Jasmine's not my Guy\nI wonder if the Kane ever Dawns on Lewis\nIt's a Sin to be Bad, but somebody's gotta do it\n\n[Little Daddy Shane]\nAshes to ashes and dust to dust (uh-huh)\nI can make a nun feel the need for lust (true)\nI can make a new car start to rust (uh-huh)\nAnd outrun the dog on the Greyhound bus\n\n[Big Daddy Kane]\nFor an MC to try to battle me freestylin'\nHis mind must be somewhere in Fantasy Island\nBut I guarantee that by the time I'm through\nI make him feel about the size of the midget Tattoo\n\n'Cause I love my brother (and I love him back)\nAnd more people of the world should be like that\nSo swing swing y'all (swing y'all) swing y'all (swing y'all)\nCHECK OUT HOW WE DO OUR THING Y'ALL\n\n[Chorus]\nBrother, brother.. help each other [repeat 2X]\n\n[Little Daddy Shane]\nRhymes that I write generate much juice\nNot like Dr. Seuss or even Mother Goose\nThey said I was a child, but then I hit em hard\nYeah it's good to send a boy to do a man's job\n\n[Big Daddy Kane]\nWell I'm the Biggest Daddy of the macks and dons\nI keep a fleet of women, probably one of them's your moms\nA voice so choice that my lips should be bronzed\nYou got ta give me thumbs up just like the Fonz\n\n[Little Daddy Shane]\nWell I'm a new jack from the new school, too cool\nBut some of the times I get bizarre (word?)\nAnd grab the microphone and catch a spell from Melle Mel\nAnd start to yell, BRRRRAHHHHH!\n\n[Big Daddy Kane]\nWhile I'm up on stage I feel that it's my duty\nTo do somethin fly, to make you shake your booty\nBecause I add the flavor just like an onion\nThe type of guy that grows on ya, just like a bunion\n\nBut I love you Shane (and I love you Kane)\nThat's somethin that the whole world needs to gain\nSo love love y'all (love y'all) love y'all (love y'all)\nJUST A LITTLE BIT OF LOVE Y'ALL..\nPEACE!", "image":

"[Big Daddy Kane]\nMmmhmm.. right, right\nWhat we have here.. is a collaboration\nOf the Big Daddy Kane.. and the Little Daddy Shane\nWe're gonna send this out to.. all the brothers\nAnd sisters, around the universe\nIt's a tune.. a tune about unity..\nAnd peace amongst each other\nAnd we're gonna have some fun, peep this\n\nThe B-to-the-I-to-the-G-to-the-D\nTo-the-A-to-the-D-to-the-D-to-the-Y\nTo-the-K-to-the-A-to-the-N-to-the-E\nThe Smooth Operator's in the place to be\n\n[Little Daddy Shane]\nThe L-to-the-I-to-the-L-to-the-D\nTo-the-A-to-the-D-to-the-D-to-the-Y\nTo-the-S-to-the-H-to-the-A-N-E\nThe Little Daddy Shane for the world to see\n\nRikki Tembo, no Sa Rembo\nItalian men, call their girls a bimbo\nPuerto Rican men call their girls muchacha\nAsk me how I know, cause I'm a girl watcher!\n\n[Big Daddy Kane]\nNow I must admit that I'm a sensitive guy\nCause I cried on Cooley High when Cochise died\nBut then again at times I may be a mean fellow\nCause I didn't give a damn about the dog Old Yeller\n\nBut I love my brother (and I love him back)\nI wish people of the world could be like that\nSo shake shake y'all (shake y'all) shake y'all (shake y'all)\nAND BUST THE MOVE WE MAKE Y'ALL\n\n[Chorus]\nBrother, brother.. help each other [repeat 2X]\n\n[Little Daddy Shane]\nI'm not Don Pardo, or Guy Lombardo\nI Love Lucy, but I'm not Ricky Ricardo\nI'm just a teen titan, that does some mean fightin\nAgainst any sucker MC that's seen bitin\n\n[Big Daddy Kane]\nI been through Different World's, gave them all a try\nKadeem is my man, but Jasmine's not my Guy\nI wonder if the Kane ever Dawns on Lewis\nIt's a Sin to be Bad, but somebody's gotta do it\n\n[Little Daddy Shane]\nAshes to ashes and dust to dust (uh-huh)\nI can make a nun feel the need for lust (true)\nI can make a new car start to rust (uh-huh)\nAnd outrun the dog on the Greyhound bus\n\n[Big Daddy Kane]\nFor an MC to try to battle me freestylin'\nHis mind must be somewhere in Fantasy Island\nBut I guarantee that by the time I'm through\nI make him feel about the size of the midget Tattoo\n\n'Cause I love my brother (and I love him back)\nAnd more people of the world should be like that\nSo swing swing y'all (swing y'all) swing y'all (swing y'all)\nCHECK OUT HOW WE DO OUR THING Y'ALL\n\n[Chorus]\nBrother, brother.. help each other [repeat 2X]\n\n[Little Daddy Shane]\nRhymes that I write generate much juice\nNot like Dr. Seuss or even Mother Goose\nThey said I was a child, but then I hit em hard\nYeah it's good to send a boy to do a man's job\n\n[Big Daddy Kane]\nWell I'm the Biggest Daddy of the macks and dons\nI keep a fleet of women, probably one of them's your moms\nA voice so choice that my lips should be bronzed\nYou got ta give me thumbs up just like the Fonz\n\n[Little Daddy Shane]\nWell I'm a new jack from the new school, too cool\nBut some of the times I get bizarre (word?)\nAnd grab the microphone and catch a spell from Melle Mel\nAnd start to yell, BRRRRAHHHHH!\n\n[Big Daddy Kane]\nWhile I'm up on stage I feel that it's my duty\nTo do somethin fly, to make you shake your booty\nBecause I add the flavor just like an onion\nThe type of guy that grows on ya, just like a bunion\n\nBut I love you Shane (and I love you Kane)\nThat's somethin that the whole world needs to gain\nSo love love y'all (love y'all) love y'all (love y'all)\nJUST A LITTLE BIT OF LOVE Y'ALL..\nPEACE!"}}, {"title": "Uncut, Pure (Original and Remix)",

down to simmer as I calmed it up\nBut take a look I think the Kane about to overcook\nCome and get it, but you better come with paramedics\nCause you couldn't bring it to me if you worked for Fed

you more of the raw\nPoint yo' hands up to the sky, high\nGet on down baby we keep it live\nRepeat\n\nVerse 3\nA good game it lets the plot thicken\nBut the thing that just ain't clickin'\nIs the way y'all legalize trickin'\nYou talk about your ride and you don't even got one\nBut I can pull a hot one, when inside of a Datsun\nThe wicked in the bed, plus the wicked in the head\nWhen I shoot the game, it's like my tongue got infra red\nLet the Messiah take you higher as I supply ya' what you require\nDesire and admire it entire\nSudden impact as I'm guttin' em black\nClosest thing to me would be (what's that?) nothing in fact\nI come with more in skill, to always score and kill\nFemales adore and thrill, sweeter thing than Lauryn Hill\nAs I return with a vengeance, here comes the day of independence\nApproach them all with some bad intentions\nIn other words I'm making them resign, diminish mine\nRunnin' through them like a finish line\n\nChorus", "image":

down baby we keep it live\nRepeat\n\nVerse 3\nA good game it lets the plot thicken\nBut the thing that just ain't clickin'\nIs the way y'all legalize trickin'\nYou talk about your ride and you don't even got one\nBut I can pull a hot one, when inside of a Datsun\nThe wicked in the bed, plus the wicked in the head\nWhen I shoot the game, it's like my tongue got infra red\nLet the Messiah take you higher as I supply ya' what you require\nDesire and admire it entire\nSudden impact as I'm guttin' em black\nClosest thing to me would be (what's that?) nothing in fact\nI come with more in skill, to always score and kill\nFemales adore and thrill, sweeter thing than Lauryn Hill\nAs I return with a vengeance, here comes the day of independence\nApproach them all with some bad intentions\nIn other words I'm making them resign, diminish mine\nRunnin' through them like a finish line\n\nChorus"}}, {"title": "Cameo Afro", "album": "Afro Samurai O.S.T.", "year": "2006-01-30", "lyrics": "[Verse 1:

all errors, give work to pall bearers\nI'm talking caskets, coffins, I'm the bastard swordsman\nThat cause the loss of massive organs\nFear factor, hereafter, disaster\nClimb like the Stairmaster, coming through, clear a path of\nThe raw aggression, that'll take your best on\nYou start talking Teflon, then you switch to Revlon\nNigga, choose your weapon, hope you got your vest on\nTalking Superman shit when you ain't got ya S on?\nGet ahead of who? Never you, skills too technical\nLeave nothing left for you but residue, the state of vegetable\nThe mad swag and do flaunt it, my dick and you want it\nOnly question now, is \"nigga, who want it?\"\nCause once trouble said (like that) trouble dead\nBoy don't make me have to pull out this double edge\nA rap pro, do a show, good to go, also\nCameo Afro, Virgo, domino\nI go Rambo, Gigolo, Romeo\nFriday night spend money on a ho-\nTel, to get a good night's sleep, I'm keeping in step\nDo I come off? Yep\n\n[GZA]\nMy sword crash through your breastplate, splash the blood on your scared face\nDrops leave your trail in the snow, showing the clear trace\nBehind punctured steel, their bodies rot\nArm

he hears nothing\nBut we punish those who play dumb, years bluffing\nFloods and bloodbaths, up on elevator shafts\nMany rivers choked with bodies, float it like rafts\nSpark wires from auto-fire, verbal and slang with gats\nStreets filled with casualties, wherever the tanks was at\nConflict is imminent, preliminary attack\nEveryone's a target, so cemeteries are packed\nA solid nigga, drink liquids and gas you up\nHit you with a stupefying drug, pass ya cup\n\n[Hook: Suga Bang Bang]\nWhy you trying to test me swordplay when I'm sharp in every way?\nThis life I live\u2014I'll do it all by

R-A-W\nTerrorist, here to bring trouble to\nPhoney emcees, I move on and sieze\nI just conquer, and stomp another rapper with ease\nCause I'm at my apex and others are be-low\nNothing but a milliliter, I'm a kilo\nSecond to none, making emcees run\nAlso don't try to step to me, cause I ain't the one\nI relieve rappers just like Tylenol\nAnd they know it, so I don't see why you all\nTry to front, perpetrating a stunt\nWhen you know that I'll smoke you up like a blunt\nI'm genuine like Gucci, raw like sushi\nThe Sage of Rage is what rap did to me\nTo make me want to create chaos and mayhem\nCold rock a party, until the A.M\nI'll make a muscle, grab the mike and hustle\nWhile you stand dazed and amazed, I'll bust a little rhyme\nWith authority, superiority\nAnd captivate the whole crowd's majority\nThe rhymes I use definately amuse\nBetter than Dynasty or Hill Street Blues\nI'm sure to score, endure for more without a flaw\nCause I get RAW!\n\n(Verse 2:)\nI give a speech like a reverend, rappers start severin\nAnd in my lifetime, believe I've never been beaten\nOr eaten, or just tookin out\nYou know, come to think about, I keep emcees lookin out\nAnd real nervous, when I'm at your service\nAlso give me that title boy, you don't deserve this\nI work like a slave to become a master\nAnd when I say a rhyme, you know that it has ta\nBe perfectly fitted, cause I'm committed\nThe entertainer and trainer and Kane'll get with it\nI go and flow and grow to let you know, I'll damage ya\nI'm not an amateur but a professional unquestionable, without a doubt superb\nAlso full of action, my name should be a verb\nMy voice will float, on every note\nWhen I clear my throat, that's all she wrote\nThe minute that the Kane starts to go on\nBelieve it's gonna be smooth sailing so sail on\nAs I put other rappers out of their misery\nGet em in a battle and make them all history\nRulin and schoolin, emcees that I'm duelin\nWatch em all take a fall, as I sit back coolin\nOn a throne, with a bronze microphone\nUhm, God bless the child that can hold his own\nCause I get raw!\n\n(Verse 3:)\nChillin, killin like a villain\nThe meaning of RAW is Ready And Willing\nTo do whatever is clever, take a loss never\nAnd the rhymes I bust, comin off is a must\nAnd I come off hard with rhymes that are odd\nI rip the microphone and leave it scarred\nNever smokin or hittin or takin a sniff\nOnly crushin emcees that be tryin to riff\nI get strong and titanic, do work like a mechanic\nMake emcees panic, they all get frantic\nAnd skeptic, like a girl on a contraceptive\nAs I rocked, but hey, what you expected?\nI'll get raw for ya, just like a warrior\nRather like a samurai, and I;ll be damn if I\nEver let a Fisher-Price emcee hang\nTheir rhymes are toy, nothing but ying yang\nSo if we battle on the microphone\nBring your own casket and tombstone\nAnd I'ma preach your funeral, tell me who in the world\nCould ever come with more, I get RAW!",

R-A-W\nTerrorist, here to bring trouble to\nPhoney emcees, I move on and sieze\nI just conquer, and stomp another rapper with ease\nCause I'm at my apex and others are be-low\nNothing but a milliliter, I'm a kilo\nSecond to none, making emcees run\nAlso don't try to step to me, cause I ain't the one\nI relieve rappers just like Tylenol\nAnd they know it, so I don't see why you all\nTry to front, perpetrating a stunt\nWhen you know that I'll smoke you up like a blunt\nI'm genuine like Gucci, raw like sushi\nThe Sage of Rage is what rap did to me\nTo make me want to create chaos and mayhem\nCold rock a party, until the A.M\nI'll make a muscle, grab the mike and hustle\nWhile you stand dazed and amazed, I'll bust a little rhyme\nWith authority, superiority\nAnd captivate the whole crowd's majority\nThe rhymes I use definately amuse\nBetter than Dynasty or Hill Street Blues\nI'm sure to score, endure for more without a flaw\nCause I get RAW!\n\n(Verse 2:)\nI give a speech like a reverend, rappers start severin\nAnd in my lifetime, believe I've never been beaten\nOr eaten, or just tookin out\nYou know, come to think about, I keep emcees lookin out\nAnd real nervous, when I'm at your service\nAlso give me that title boy, you don't deserve this\nI work like a slave to become a master\nAnd when I say a rhyme, you know that it has ta\nBe perfectly fitted, cause I'm committed\nThe entertainer and trainer and Kane'll get with it\nI go and flow and grow to let you know, I'll damage ya\nI'm not an amateur but a professional unquestionable, without a doubt superb\nAlso full of action, my name should be a verb\nMy voice will float, on every note\nWhen I clear my throat, that's all she wrote\nThe minute that the Kane starts to go on\nBelieve it's gonna be smooth sailing so sail on\nAs I put other rappers out of their misery\nGet em in a battle and make them all history\nRulin and schoolin, emcees that I'm duelin\nWatch em all take a fall, as I sit back coolin\nOn a throne, with a bronze microphone\nUhm, God bless the child that can hold his own\nCause I get raw!\n\n(Verse 3:)\nChillin, killin like a villain\nThe meaning of RAW is Ready And Willing\nTo do whatever is clever, take a loss never\nAnd the rhymes I bust, comin off is a must\nAnd I come off hard with rhymes that are odd\nI rip the microphone and leave it scarred\nNever smokin or hittin or takin a sniff\nOnly crushin emcees that be tryin to riff\nI get strong and titanic, do work like a mechanic\nMake emcees panic, they all get frantic\nAnd skeptic, like a girl on a contraceptive\nAs I rocked, but hey, what you expected?\nI'll get raw for ya, just like a warrior\nRather like a samurai, and I;ll be damn if I\nEver let a Fisher-Price emcee hang\nTheir rhymes are toy, nothing but ying yang\nSo if we battle on the microphone\nBring your own casket and tombstone\nAnd I'ma preach your funeral, tell me who in the world\nCould ever come with more, I get RAW!"}},

be in her corner\nMake her feel like the most\nFor example -- forget Goodfellas, and take her to see Ghost\nWine and dine under candlelight\nMake the mood right tonight while the stars are bright\nThen hop in the hot tub and start to rub her on her back\nTssssh, yeah they like that\nSatisfaction guaranteed\nWe gotta give the woman what she need\nThese days, they don't be fallin for no phony Casanova\nSince they started watchin Oprah\nSo even if it's not your style\nOpen the door for them once in a while\nEven buyin them some flowers don't hurt\nYeah it sounds old fashioned.. but it works!\nConversation, good communication\nOnly makes things better in a relation\nCause if you keep watchin the game every week\nYou might find out your wife's gettin dunked by Dominique\nAnd that can be so upsettin\nSo try a little Tenderness like Otis Redding\nPut the gangster approach on pause\nAnd I dedicate this to you and yours\n\nThis is for the lover in you\nThe lover in you, babe, the lover in you (2X)\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow, what I'm gonna do to keep the flame warm\nIs sing a better love song than Jeffrey Osborne\nSerenade a double, what I mean is a couple\nThat might wanna hug and

her\nWith some of that Babyface routine, know what I mean?\nT-E-N-D-E-R L-O-V-I-N-G C-A-R-E\nYou figure that out, and keep it in mind\nWhile I bring the chorus back for ya one more time\n\nThis is for the lover in you\nThe lover in you, babe, the lover in you (2X)\n\n(One two three!)\n\n[Verse 3]\nI wanna do somethin' freaky to you\nTake you to a level that you never been to\nCause no one knows where the nose goes\nWhen the doors close, so take off your pantyhose\nI wanna see you moan and groan as I nibble\nOn your bodily parts as I proceed to jump your bones\nAnd put your feet up here my dear\nSo I can lick upon your toes until your Revlon disappear\nThe passion between will be so incredible\nAs I prove that a woman is edible\nSo if you're game for havin a ball\nLadies, I send this out to y'all\n\nThis is for the lover in you\nThe lover in you, babe, the lover in you (4X)\n\nThis is for the lover in you..", "image":

parts as I proceed to jump your bones\nAnd put your feet up here my dear\nSo I can lick upon your toes until your Revlon disappear\nThe passion between will be so incredible\nAs I prove that a woman is edible\nSo if you're game for havin a ball\nLadies, I send this out to y'all\n\nThis is for the lover in you\nThe lover in you, babe, the lover in you (4X)\n\nThis is for the lover in you.."}},

Mack man number one, you know how I move\nYou'd think that I'd be shavin my rhymes, cause they'd be so smooth\nMr. Wonderful and all of that gun to pull shit\nThat you be talkin nigga don't even run the bull\nCause if I roll on you kid, I do the body rude\nLike the cops did on ummmmmm.. that Rodney dude\nPeep it!\n\nChorus: repeat 4X (except last line 4th time)\n\n\"welcome to a new Terrordome\nWhen I come to roam you know daddy's home..\"\nWatch out now!\n\n[Big Daddy Kane]\nJust like Sylvester it's still on, get it?\nStill, on, fukkit, let's move along\nI rip shop, in hip-hop, to sew it like a ziplock\nTo get props, in this spot, look at me at the tip-top\nThe kid got, to get hot, you thought that I would flip-flop\nOr drop-drop, but ummmmmmmmmmmm.. I did not!\nThey say, \"Kane you're old school out here!\"\nI said, \"I guess I got left back, cause I ain't goin nowhere\"\nThe Kane will remain in this domain\nTo reign again when I entertain\nCause when it comes to lyrics, I got plenty black\nI'm so god damn dope, I sell rhymes in a twenty sack\nThe microphone pusher man but not drug related\nHip-Hop orientated, keepin you captivated\nMr. Cee cuts, I linger through em, Larry is singin to em\nAnd oh me, I just bring it to em\n\nChorus *fades out*"}}, {"title": "Entaprizin'", "album": "Veteranz Day", "year": "1998-04-28", "lyrics": "This one

by now I hope the Luniz got a hundred on it\nAnd if you're in it for the millions E-40\nI hope you see 40, before you be 40\nWhat it look like, the great paper chase for ends\nLost Boyz being found in Lex coups, Bimas and Benz\nEast Coast, West Coast unite, let's keep it tight\nAnd everything's gonna be alright\nBut hold up, it seems we got some hip-hop cheats\nDepending on just having catchy hooks and beats\nRappers using their skills recently I haven't heard of none\nMe, I represent myself better than Collin Ferguson\nAnd yes that I do, I'll shatter you\nIt don't even matter who, I'll make them all show gratitude\nFools, acting like they don't know the rules\nNeed to learn to listen when grown folks is droppin' jewels\nNow they say, is Mr. Kane coming back to dominate\nI used to listen to his music back in 1988\nDamn he still pumpin', just when you think he ain't nothing\nThat kid just keep coming back, what is he the Terminator or something\nLord I skill it in a way to make you feel it\nFinally I reveal it, party people they can't wait until-\nStarts to boom out, so every rap consumer\nCan bring that old schooler back just like alumni\nI sting it, booyah, to stop the half steppers tryin' to wing it through ya\nDon't make me have to bring it to ya'\nWho gonna be the next clown to come step into my bounds\nRight now get down for the crown, mess around get pound to the ground by the sound\nAnd let the more experienced entertain\nKane, meet the microphone, microphone meet Kane\nThe legendaire, rap extraordinaire\nCommutin' to your ear, yeah, looka here\n\nChorus 2x",

like Raekwon, support 'em so they stay on\nThen brothers like Smooth wouldn't have to hustle\nIt's an every day struggle, but hip-hop I still love you\n\nChorus\nWe Entaprizin, got the hip-hop heads realizin'\nEast Coast, West Coast organizin'\nSteady risin', money sizin'\nWhat we specialize in\nRepeat\n\nVerse 2\nThe fame in the rap game we all want it\nIn fact by now I hope the Luniz got a hundred on it\nAnd if you're in it for the millions E-40\nI hope you see 40, before you be 40\nWhat it look like, the great paper chase for ends\nLost Boyz being found in Lex coups, Bimas and Benz\nEast Coast, West Coast unite, let's keep it tight\nAnd everything's gonna be alright\nBut hold up, it seems we got some hip-hop cheats\nDepending on just having catchy hooks and beats\nRappers using their skills recently I haven't heard of none\nMe, I represent myself better than Collin Ferguson\nAnd yes that I do, I'll shatter you\nIt don't even matter who, I'll make them all show gratitude\nFools, acting like they don't know the rules\nNeed to learn to listen when grown folks is droppin' jewels\nNow they say, is Mr. Kane coming back to dominate\nI used to listen to his music back in 1988\nDamn he still pumpin', just when you think he ain't nothing\nThat kid just keep coming back, what is he the Terminator or something\nLord I skill it in a way to make you feel it\nFinally I reveal it, party people they can't wait until-\nStarts to boom out, so every rap consumer\nCan bring that old schooler back just like alumni\nI sting it, booyah, to stop the half steppers tryin' to wing it through ya\nDon't make me have to bring it to ya'\nWho gonna be the next clown to come step into my bounds\nRight now get down for the crown, mess around get pound to the ground by the sound\nAnd let the more experienced entertain\nKane, meet the microphone, microphone meet Kane\nThe legendaire, rap extraordinaire\nCommutin' to your ear, yeah, looka here\n\nChorus 2x"}}, {"title":

the U.S.A\nA young brother made into a slave\nTo harvest the midlands and clean the chittlins\nGiven a new name, new religion\nNo freedom to vote, not even to make a decision\nI saw my peoples, sold raped and took out\nThe rest of that stuff that Alex Haley talks about\nThey said I'm not from Asia I'm from Africa\nAnd all the blacks there now are just scavengers\nThat's the way my mind was poisoned\nTo believe that in America blacks are inferior\nA weak mind and a body of swine\nOnly adds up to being - deaf, dumb and blind\nIlliterate to who where what and why\nSo I ask myself: who am I?\n\n\"I was born..\"\n\n[Verse 2: Big Daddy Kane]\nA native New Yorker on the streets\nKnown for rockin rhymes to real rough beats\nThat I found in the attic, noisy with static\nA sound that made me a Hip-Hop fanatic\nI made a few songs that sold OK\nNever top 20 or plenty airplay\nI came out hardcore, flexin cock diesel\nSaw a little cash and pop goes the weasel\nI had to make that change and rearrange\nMy whole rap format, no hardcore rap\nSo now all the pop charts I rule\nOver New Kids on the Block and Paula Abdul, huh\nI thought I made it, then my song faded\nAnd none of the black stations ever have played it\nI tried to blame it on MTV\nAnd say, \"Damn, they cold played me for Young MC\"\nBut when you get down to it, I'm the real blame\nBecause I wanted the fame\nMoney is not only the root of all evil\nIt's also the destruction of black people, so\nConjunction junction, what's your function?\nBeing a scout or sellin out?\nLook in the mirror at yourself, eye to eye\nAnd say: who am I?\n\n[Verse 3: Gamilah Shabazz]\nA solid change, have to rearrange this strange\nFeelin I'm feelin, so appealin'\nI am having to deal with\nTime to forget the myth of bein black and a woman\nCan't get ahead, walkin on a thread, a tightrope\nCan't cope, don't be a dope, have a little bit of hope\nRunnin' your scope on affairs\nYou have to be aware, don't flare up\nLet your cup runneth over\nI'm not Irish, don't need a donut to fill up my dish\nNor two mango wish to wish on a star, they're so far\nAnyway I'm thinkin about today, not tomorrow\nI'm not a follower of anyone\nMy time has come, it's already here\nMy message is clear\nLike the women of long ago, I am also here\nAlso to show, I have the courage\nHave the strength, I'm for equal opportunity\nNo matter the life, length of time\nShow me a sign, should I rely on a\nSubliminal message, should I question\nWhat would seem to be, life's told me?\nYes indeed, so let me speak\n\n[Big Daddy Kane]\nAnd that's comin from the daughter of Malcolm X\nSo black women put it in your texts\nSo you can never let, opportunity pass you by\nOr even ask yourself, who am I?", "image":

Please join us in the mourning of this U-47. It was a great microphone in its day until it met it's fate. One evening while it was in the studio\nIt was struck by the lyrical force of the Big Daddy Kane. So ashes to ashes, and dust to dust, may this microphone, rest, in peace\n\n[Verse 1]\nKnock knock, guess who? Yes, ooh\nThe Bigger the B, the Iggah the I, the Jigga the G is comin through\nYes I'm the one with clout, they're all talkin' bout\nTo be frank, I have the flavor like sauerkraut\nThe microphone assassinator and furthermore\nI murdered plenty rappers and believe that I'll murder more\nSo if you ask to give the Kane a go\nYou better treat me like drugs, and Just Say No\nBecause I utilize my skills to brutalize\nAnd in a battle, man, you should see what I do to guys\nWhenever the mic's mine, I'll rock a hype rhyme\nAnd come off, like dirty panties at nighttime\nCause any mic that I caress, I finesse\nWith zest, and just bless, best yet to progress\nKing Asiatic, no other rapper stands this\nYou couldn't be a King if you played hockey in Los Angeles\nI gets pi-daid, top gri-dade, gotta admit-eh\nPoint blank, the kid's stri-daight\nCause when it comes to R-A-P-P-I-N, huh\nI got it locked up like a bullpen\n\n[Scratching]\n\"May you rest in peace\"\n\"May you rest in peace\"\n\"May you rest in peace\"\n\"If this meaning doesn't manifest, put it to rest\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nRappers I get em and hit em and slit em and split em and rid em\nAcquit em, when I get with em, you can tell that I did em\nI take em and shake em and bake em and ache em and break em\nAnd rake em, you can't awake 'em from the comatose way I make 'em\nCause when you're messin' with me, you know what?\nYou can swallow a live grenade and you still won't blow up\nPickin' up the microphone, you shouldn't dare\nIt's like being on a Stairmaster, climbin' and goin' nowhere\nYou're perpetratin' like you're ready and able\nBut couldn't rock a show if the stage was a cradle\nYour rhymes are old as an artifact, and you don't want no part of that\nSo don't even start it black\nAnyone riffin', I show them how I'm livin'\nAnd give them some of that treatment like my man Michael Bivins\nI smack em up, flip em and then shove em down\nHuh, oh I-ah-ah-I-ah-I-ah-I don't be fuckin' around\nTo rip this microphone like this today\nSince eighty-seven I came a long, long way\nTo headlinin', all the way from supportin'\nAnd I know you've been watchin' me Norton!\nThrough my whole rap career, a lot of young, huh\nRappers sat there, and listened, a lot of young, huh\nRappers sat there, and wishin', but\nYou couldn't see the Kane with X-Ray vision\nAnd just because you didn't see my crew for a few\nA lot of people thought the Wolfpack was through\nBut if you think the Kane and Scoob and Scrap'll breakup\nI tell you like Marvin Gaye, \"Wake up, wake up, wake up\"\nPut it to rest, it's best to 'fess\nBecause the Kane is breakin' rappers like the IRS\nAnd consider this microphone the deceased\nNow may it rest in peace\n\n[Scratching]\n\"May you rest in peace\"\n\"May you rest in peace\"\n\"May you rest in peace\"\n\"May you rest in peace\"\n\"May you rest in peace\"\n\"May you rest in peace\"\n\"May you rest in peace\"\n\"If this meaning doesn't manifest, put it to rest!\"",

"lyrics": "[Production by Easy Mo Bee]\n\n[Intro]\nDearly beloved, we are gathered here today for this somber occasion. Please join us in the mourning of this U-47. It was a great microphone in its day until it met it's fate. One evening while it was in the studio\nIt was struck by the lyrical force of the Big Daddy Kane. So ashes to ashes, and dust to dust, may this microphone, rest, in peace\n\n[Verse 1]\nKnock knock, guess who? Yes, ooh\nThe Bigger the B, the Iggah the I, the Jigga the G is comin through\nYes I'm the one with clout, they're all talkin' bout\nTo be frank, I have the flavor like sauerkraut\nThe microphone assassinator and furthermore\nI murdered plenty rappers and believe that I'll murder more\nSo if you ask to give the Kane a go\nYou better treat me like drugs, and Just Say No\nBecause I utilize my skills to brutalize\nAnd in a battle, man, you should see what I do to guys\nWhenever the mic's mine, I'll rock a hype rhyme\nAnd come off, like dirty panties at nighttime\nCause any mic that I caress, I finesse\nWith zest, and just bless, best yet to progress\nKing Asiatic, no other rapper stands this\nYou couldn't be a King if you played hockey in Los Angeles\nI gets pi-daid, top gri-dade, gotta admit-eh\nPoint blank, the kid's stri-daight\nCause when it comes to R-A-P-P-I-N, huh\nI got it locked up like a bullpen\n\n[Scratching]\n\"May you rest in peace\"\n\"May you rest in peace\"\n\"May you rest in peace\"\n\"If this meaning doesn't manifest, put it to rest\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nRappers I get em and hit em and slit em and split em and rid em\nAcquit em, when I get with em, you can tell that I did em\nI take em and shake em and bake em and ache em and break em\nAnd rake em, you can't awake 'em from the comatose way I make 'em\nCause when you're messin' with me, you know what?\nYou can swallow a live grenade and you still won't blow up\nPickin' up the microphone, you shouldn't dare\nIt's like being on a Stairmaster, climbin' and goin' nowhere\nYou're perpetratin' like you're ready and able\nBut couldn't rock a show if the stage was a cradle\nYour rhymes are old as an artifact, and you don't want no part of that\nSo don't even start it black\nAnyone riffin', I show them how I'm livin'\nAnd give them some of that treatment like my man Michael Bivins\nI smack em up, flip em and then shove em down\nHuh, oh I-ah-ah-I-ah-I-ah-I don't be fuckin' around\nTo rip this microphone like this today\nSince eighty-seven I came a long, long way\nTo headlinin', all the way from supportin'\nAnd I know you've been watchin' me Norton!\nThrough my whole rap career, a lot of young, huh\nRappers sat there, and listened, a lot of young, huh\nRappers sat there, and wishin', but\nYou couldn't see the Kane with X-Ray vision\nAnd just because you didn't see my crew for a few\nA lot of people thought the Wolfpack was through\nBut if you think the Kane and Scoob and Scrap'll breakup\nI tell you like Marvin Gaye, \"Wake up, wake up, wake up\"\nPut it to rest, it's best to 'fess\nBecause the Kane is breakin' rappers like the IRS\nAnd consider this microphone the deceased\nNow may it rest in peace\n\n[Scratching]\n\"May you rest in peace\"\n\"May you rest in peace\"\n\"May you rest in peace\"\n\"May you rest in peace\"\n\"May you rest in peace\"\n\"May you rest in peace\"\n\"May you rest in peace\"\n\"If this meaning doesn't manifest, put it to rest!\""}}, {"title": "La-La-Land", "album": "Veteranz Day", "year": "1998-04-28", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nDon't you know it ain't what you got y'all it's how you use it\nAny way you choose it, baby,

surface\nMy purpose is making sure you bless me right\nSo I can climb aboard that money train with Wesley Snipes\nDaddy love how I get down ain't no secret\nAnd every night, my backyard is just like the freaknik\nWhat you mean from hot sexy mamas to cool prima donna's\nEasy pickings on the chickens got them up in the camp\nIt's that old tramp, the one who keep your pum pum's damp\nI see the honeys in the frontier looking for what you want dear\nYes, there's a lot of game run here\n\n[Chorus]\nAll the playas in the game\nAnother year\nAnd ain't a damn thing changed\nWe get together and we do our thing\nRepeat\n\n[Verse 2]\nOn stage at arenas or a show in the park\nI shine so bright my black ass glow in the dark\nIf you're ready or not, if you're petty or hot\nHere comes the reign of Kane about to get in your spot\nYour tough talk's monotonous, beware as I be droppin' this\nLyrical apocalypse all through your metropolis\nSexual Chocolate the velvet smooth voice\nThat be the

cats, they be shifty, some cats they be iffy\nSo I move swiftly, play the field like Ken Griffey\nBecause, I be the all mighty, relax like Tai Chi\nMaking it irie\nI flow over tracks when the beats

from it being too tight\n\n[Chorus]"}}, {"title": "Taste of Chocolate Intro", "album": "Taste of Chocolate", "year": "1990-10-30", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nYeah..\nYou know, 1990 begins a new decade\nSince I got paid and blew up like a live grenade\nIt's been a three, four year stretch\nAnd I'd just like to thank all of you\nMmm..\nAnd this goes to everybody in the entire world\nThat means the United States, overseas in the U.K\nWay in Brazil, Japan, Africa, and everywhere else\nI just wanna dedicate this one to you\n\n[Verse 1]\nHere's another groove that I'm bringin' to you kind of mellow\nAnd I just want to say hello\nOr should I say peace as I start to release\nThe poetry that don't cease, never the least\nYour feet got to shuffle as I put the muscle in the groove\n'Cause I'm so smooth\nOnce you experience a whole Kane rhyme\nI'll have you dancin' in a Soul Train line\nPick up the pace and get a taste of B-I-G\nD-A-double-D-Y Kane in the place\nDoin' the job how you want it done\nWith lyrics that's bright as the mornin' sun\nSo, grab one line, rub it on your face like sunshine\nAnd everythin' else'll combine\nThis is that particular beat\nFor all the fellows feelin' mellow to pump in the Jeep\nUhh, also for every girly\nTo shamiyo, shamago like Laverne and Shirley\nHuh, now, wait, now, wait, now, wait a minute\nUhh! Now, check this\nI wanna talk about peace and unity and love\nNot one, but all of the above\nComin' together like keys on a piano\nBlack and white to unite and oh man, oh man\nWhat joy do we find?\nHard for me to say it sometimes\n\n[Verse 2]\nNothin' can stop this flow so back up off me\nHold your cup of Folgers, wake up and smell the coffee\nBig Daddy Kane\u2019s the name of the one and only\nYou wanna say it three times like Tony! Toni! Ton\u00e9!\nIt\u2019s not an avocation of being the best\nBut I at least deserve a cape or an S on my chest\nQuote: \u201cThe blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\u201d\nMmm, they shoulda never turned me loose\n'Cause I\u2019m a true livin' Casanova\nSmooth and stylistic and suave bowler\nAnd they say nasty couldn\u2019t even tell it\n'Cause when I\u2019m with girls, I get Funkadelic\nSo, ladies stand still as I start to fulfill\nJust chill, the scenery\u2019s about to get ill\nThe places I feel to give your body a thrill\nAs I rub you the right way like Johnny Gill\nAnd competition take notes from a champ\nYou once had this but all your girls broke camp\nAnd now you wanna diss\nYou swung but you missed\nSo, now, tip your hat and bow down to this\nWho? The father of civilization\nWith knowledge of self under any situation\nThe F to the I to the V to the E\nThe P-E-R-C-E-N-T\nThat means an Asiatic king just rocked it\nAnd left your mouth wet with a taste of chocolate\nThat\u2019s right, y'all, and that\u2019s right, y'all\nMy rhymes freshen the air like Lysol\nGirls, uh, right there, yeah, right there\n\n[Production by Big Daddy Kane]", "image":

mattress and on the box springs\nGirls, they wanna sport me like bamboo earrings\nThe go-getter, the skins-hitter\nAnd if your girl says she met me, I probably did her\nWord up, the sex super stud\nI jump your bones like ten Crips against one Blood\n(Nasty!) The N-A-S-T-Y\nReady for action if you wanna see why\nSo come on, and let's do this\nAs I tiptoe through your tulips\nLike Moses, I part them legs like the Red Sea\nAnd then I plant somethin' deadly\nPoundin' and poundin', is how I'm servin' this\nMakin' it look like your bed is goin' through turbulence\nLots of lust, between the two of us\nThe sign on my Jimmy says, \"Kidney's or bust,\" so\nI shove deeper than the voice of Barry\nTo make you hit high notes like Mariah Carey\nIt's like a Morris Day jerkout\nTo put you in more positions than a Jane Fonda workout\nI'm ready to tear down walls\nYou say let's chill, but to hell with that\nI'm not Aaron Hall, so...\n\n[Hook]\nGive it to me, give it to me\nGive it to me, give it to me\nGive it to me, give it to me\nGive it to me, give it to me\n(Give it in)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI paid the cost to be the boss\nLike with that HIV rumor they tried to toss\nBut I'm so good with the women that if I ever caught AIDS\nA woman doctor'd find a cure just so she could get laid\nSo never fear my dear, just come on over here\nI practice safe sex, with girls I lay next\nIn other words, the J-hat's on the head\nCause I'm too sexy for AIDS like Right Said Fred\nSo can I touch you there, huh? Huh?\nI like to take my, time, whenever, I'm\nMassagin' my fingers through a girl, ooh-wee\nI leave her wet, just like her beaver had a Jheri curl\nThen I begin to hit those skins\nSo baby doll, let let me in\nAnd if you're the slight bit tight from virginity..\n.. vaseline on me!\n\n[Hook]\nGive it to me, give it to me\nGive it to me, give it to me\nGive it to me, give it to me\nGive it to me, give it to me\n(Give it in)\n\n[sample of a sex scene from a movie]\n\n[Verse 3]\nJust another pervert that loves to flirt\nWith a skirt so at a concert, girls stay alert\nCause I be hoppin' on 'em just like a frog\nI run through, a Luke video, like it's a smorgasbord\nI start sweatin', my back gets to humpin'\nThen I thump and I thump and I thump and I thump\nI don't carry a gun but I'm packin' somethin' lethal\nOne of the last she-BOINKIN people\nSo come on Miss Thing don't front\nYou got me on a hunt, and you know what I want, that\nU-S-S-Y, wait, that's not the way, oh\nPass the Peas like they used to say!\nAnd when I give you this fat one\nYou gotta guard your grill, honey\nNonononononono, not that one..\nBecause I give girls the grand slam\nI'm like a radio station; continuous jams\n\n[Hook]\nGive it to me, give it to me\nGive it to me, give it to me\nGive it to me, give it to me\nGive it to me, give it to me"}}, {"title": "No Damn Good", "album": "Taste of Chocolate",

gee\nThey need a sincere leader\n{Big Daddy Kane:}\nYou know, I've heard it said\nYou gotta use what you got to get what you want\nBut I think they're usin a little bit too much when they flaunt\nYou know\n[Name], you know, ehm\nI don't understand the way these girls is rolling today, man\nHow about you, man?\n{Male voice:}\nYo, let me tell you somethin, gee\nIf they ain't lying they tryin to do some other - wildness\n{Big Daddy Kane:}\nI know, I know\nIt's like girls promisin you Thomas's\nAnd can't even cook toast, right?\nWhat I'm tryin to tell you, man, is...\nThey just ain't no damn good\nNo damn good\nCheck it out\n\n[Verse 1]\nNow there's this girl named Monique\nThe type of female that you consider a freak\nA big-time player playin like a drum beat\nYou think her address is 21 Hump Street\nShe step out every night to swing\nWith her Lee press-on's and a nefertiti ring\nBamboo earrings all big and lookin silly\nWith extensions hangin down like Milli Vanilli\nAnd every Wednesday night at the Apollo\nFirst kid she saw with jewerly she'd follow\nAnd Monique would be ready to sleep\nWith the first kid in a Benz or a Cherokee Jeep\nStrung out and givin up the nappy dug out\nYou're on the critical list, about to pull the plug out\nSo here, nympho, here's some good info\nStop takin em putts and close your legs, toots\nCause I remember you was one of a kind and a fine - hm\nI once was infatuated by the things that you do\nBut now you're doodoo\nIt's all about respectin yourself\nIn order to gain respect from anyone else\nTreat yourself like a real woman should\nCause bitch, you ain't no damn good\n\nThat's right, there's a lotta young ladies out here\nThat just ain't no damn good\n{Female voice:}\nBut hold up minute\nThere's a lotta guys out there that ain't no damn good either\n{Big Daddy Kane:}\nOh yeah?\n{Female voice:}\nYeah, cause I had to tell one the other night\nThat his thing had too many 'nots' in it\n{Big Daddy Kane:}\nWhat you mean by too many 'nots'?\n{Female voice:}\nNot big enough, not hard enough, and not long enough\n{Big Daddy Kane:}\nYeah, aight\nBut check this here out\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell now, here's another story\nAbout this kid by the name of Corey\nA hustler with game tryin to make a name\nThat was his aim, but his lifestyle was lame\nCause he would front like it wasn't even funny\nAbout his girl, his car, and his money\nPullin out a knot every place\nBut every single bill had Washington's face\nAnd he went beyond exaggeration\nTo lie about his means of transportation\nBecause he said he had a Benz car\nCome to find out, it was his friend's car\nTalk about simple chronic halitosis\nDamn, his breath was ferocious\nHe had an odor that just won't quit\nSmelled like he washed in Oil Of Oh shit\nTellin girls he's daddy long-strokin\n(Shit, you must be jokin)\nCause he ain't got no bitches\nAnd couldn't hurt a virgin if her pussy had stitches\nSee, Corey, there's a lot you're missin\nSeems to me, you ain't got a pot to piss in\nSo let's get one thing understood\nMuthafucka, you ain't no damn good\n\n{Prince Paul:}\nThe moral of the story is\nThe majority of the population of males and females today\nAre just no damn good", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9018e5e448f4d08b6115d24de00e8af0.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Big Daddy Kane", "raw": {"annotation_count": 2, "api_path": "/songs/10221",

ladies today\n{Male voice:}\nYo, they're hard to figure out, gee\nThey need a sincere leader\n{Big Daddy Kane:}\nYou know, I've heard it said\nYou gotta use what you got to get what you want\nBut I think they're usin a little bit too much when they flaunt\nYou know\n[Name], you know, ehm\nI don't understand the way these girls is rolling today, man\nHow about you, man?\n{Male voice:}\nYo, let me tell you somethin, gee\nIf they ain't lying they tryin to do some other - wildness\n{Big Daddy Kane:}\nI know, I know\nIt's like girls promisin you Thomas's\nAnd can't even cook toast, right?\nWhat I'm tryin to tell you, man, is...\nThey just ain't no damn good\nNo damn good\nCheck it out\n\n[Verse 1]\nNow there's this girl named Monique\nThe type of female that you consider a freak\nA big-time player playin like a drum beat\nYou think her address is 21 Hump Street\nShe step out every night to swing\nWith her Lee press-on's and a nefertiti ring\nBamboo earrings all big and lookin silly\nWith extensions hangin down like Milli Vanilli\nAnd every Wednesday night at the Apollo\nFirst kid she saw with jewerly she'd follow\nAnd Monique would be ready to sleep\nWith the first kid in a Benz or a Cherokee Jeep\nStrung out and givin up the nappy dug out\nYou're on the critical list, about to pull the plug out\nSo here, nympho, here's some good info\nStop takin em putts and close your legs, toots\nCause I remember you was one of a kind and a fine - hm\nI once was infatuated by the things that you do\nBut now you're doodoo\nIt's all about respectin yourself\nIn order to gain respect from anyone else\nTreat yourself like a real woman should\nCause bitch, you ain't no damn good\n\nThat's right, there's a lotta young ladies out here\nThat just ain't no damn good\n{Female voice:}\nBut hold up minute\nThere's a lotta guys out there that ain't no damn good either\n{Big Daddy Kane:}\nOh yeah?\n{Female voice:}\nYeah, cause I had to tell one the other night\nThat his thing had too many 'nots' in it\n{Big Daddy Kane:}\nWhat you mean by too many 'nots'?\n{Female voice:}\nNot big enough, not hard enough, and not long enough\n{Big Daddy Kane:}\nYeah, aight\nBut check this here out\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell now, here's another story\nAbout this kid by the name of Corey\nA hustler with game tryin to make a name\nThat was his aim, but his lifestyle was lame\nCause he would front like it wasn't even funny\nAbout his girl, his car, and his money\nPullin out a knot every place\nBut every single bill had Washington's face\nAnd he went beyond exaggeration\nTo lie about his means of transportation\nBecause he said he had a Benz car\nCome to find out, it was his friend's car\nTalk about simple chronic halitosis\nDamn, his breath was ferocious\nHe had an odor that just won't quit\nSmelled like he washed in Oil Of Oh shit\nTellin girls he's daddy long-strokin\n(Shit, you must be jokin)\nCause he ain't got no bitches\nAnd couldn't hurt a virgin if her pussy had stitches\nSee, Corey, there's a lot you're missin\nSeems to me, you ain't got a pot to piss in\nSo let's get one thing understood\nMuthafucka, you ain't no damn good\n\n{Prince Paul:}\nThe moral of the story is\nThe majority of the population of males and females today\nAre just no damn good"}}, {"title": "I'm Not Ashamed", "album": "Prince of Darkness", "year": null, "lyrics": "[Big Daddy

around)\nFrom city to city, from state to state\nAnd of course, from girl to girl\n(Ooooooooooh-eauuuuuuu-ooooooooooooh)\nAnd I believe that I've played every game in the world\nThat one man could possibly play (don't play with me baby)\nAnd of all those games, you're the only chip on the table\nThat's made me feel this way (aiy-yi-yahhhhahhhhhhhhh)\nNow I realize that love takes time\nAnd trust is somethin that you have to earn\n(Oooooooh, you gotta earn it baby) mmm\nWell I'm prepared to give you all of me\nBut, I need the same in return (ooooooohoooo you know you got it)\nThese are some things that I've been meaning to say\nAnd for my concealed feelings I've come to realize\nThat I'm to blame (arrrrrrrrre you sure)\nSo I have to take a little time out to get together\nNow baby, I'm not ashamed\n\n[Alyson Williams]\nLet yourself be free (I'm not ashamed)\nExpress yourself to me (I'm not ashamed)\nTry to make me see (I'm not ashamed)\nWhat sparks would start this flame\nTake

life as a player\n(mmm-hmmm) Looked at every woman as ahhh..\nAs ahhh.. as just a one night affair\n(One night love affair)\nNow all of a sudden I feel this change that makes me lonnnng\nFor some type of commitment (don't you want it)\nNah, since I said _Ain't No Half-Steppin'_ (talk to me)\nAww yeah, I'm with this (c'mon)\nAnd let's become two of a kind, a perfect pair in which\nAll feelins are the same (c'mon)\nAll love and respect\nAnd never ever, feeling ashamed\n\n[Alyson Williams]\nLet yourself be free (I'm not ashamed)\nExpress yourself to me (I'm not ashamed)\nTry to make me see (I'm

"[Big Daddy Kane]\nI can't hold back any longer\nI can't prolong my feelings for you any more\nYou know all of a sudden I feel this certain need to..\n.. express myself to you\nYou see before I felt kind of funny to say these kind of things\nI mean to be all honest, that is, but now.. hmm..\nWell let's just say I'm not ashamed\n\nNow in my lifetime I've been all around the world\n(Round and around and around)\nFrom city to city, from state to state\nAnd of course, from girl to girl\n(Ooooooooooh-eauuuuuuu-ooooooooooooh)\nAnd I believe that I've played every game in the world\nThat one man could possibly play (don't play with me baby)\nAnd of all those games, you're the only chip on the table\nThat's made me feel this way (aiy-yi-yahhhhahhhhhhhhh)\nNow I realize that love takes time\nAnd trust is somethin that you have to earn\n(Oooooooh, you gotta earn it baby) mmm\nWell I'm prepared to give you all of me\nBut, I need the same in return (ooooooohoooo you know you got it)\nThese are some things that I've been meaning to say\nAnd for my concealed feelings I've come to realize\nThat I'm to blame (arrrrrrrrre you sure)\nSo I have to take a little time out to get together\nNow baby, I'm not ashamed\n\n[Alyson Williams]\nLet yourself be free (I'm not ashamed)\nExpress yourself to me (I'm not ashamed)\nTry to make me see (I'm not ashamed)\nWhat sparks would start this flame\nTake it nice and slow (I'm not ashamed)\nNever let me go (I'm not ashamed)\nI want to let you know (I'm not ashamed)\nDon't ever feel ashamed\n\n[Big Daddy Kane]\nYou know just yesterday I portrayed my life as a player\n(mmm-hmmm) Looked at every woman as ahhh..\nAs ahhh.. as just a one night affair\n(One night love affair)\nNow all of a sudden I feel this change that makes me lonnnng\nFor some type of commitment (don't you want it)\nNah, since I said _Ain't No Half-Steppin'_ (talk to me)\nAww yeah, I'm with this (c'mon)\nAnd let's become two of a kind, a perfect pair in which\nAll feelins are the same (c'mon)\nAll love and respect\nAnd never ever, feeling ashamed\n\n[Alyson Williams]\nLet yourself be free (I'm not ashamed)\nExpress yourself to me (I'm not ashamed)\nTry to make me see (I'm not ashamed)\nWhat sparks would start this flame\nTake it nice and slow (I'm not ashamed)\nNever let me go (I'm not ashamed)\nI want to let you know (I'm not ashamed)\nDon't ever feel ashamed\n\nLet yourself be free (I'm not ashamed)\nExpress yourself to me (I'm not ashamed)\nTry to make me see (I'm not ashamed)\nWhat sparks would start this flame\nTake it nice and slow (I'm not ashamed)\nNever let me go (I'm not ashamed)\nI want to let you know (I'm not ashamed)\nDon't ever feel ashamed, talk to me baby!\n\nHuhahhhhhhh, ahhohuhhahahhhh\nAhhh just let yourself be free\nAhhh come on and talk to me\nHuahahhahhhhh try to make me see\nOoooohoohoooooh, you see I\nI know that you played every game..\nAhh but I love you just the same, hooooh\nWe'll take it nice and slow yeah\nWe don't ever have to let it goooooooo\nNooooo yeah, don't you ever feel ashamed, no no!\n\nLet yourself be free (I'm not ashamed)\nExpress yourself to me (I'm not ashamed)\nTry to make me see (I'm not ashamed)\nWhat sparks would start this flame\nTake it nice and slow (I'm not ashamed)\nNever let me go (I'm not ashamed)\nWanna let you know (I'm not ashamed)\nDon't ever feel ashamed sugar\n\nLet yourself be free (I'm not ashamed)\nExpress yourself to me (I'm not ashamed)\nTry and make me see (I'm not ashamed)\nWhat sparks would start this flame\nTake it nice and slow (I'm

"lyrics": "[Kane]\nOkay, okay, okay, okay\nAttention to the whole crew\nScoob Lover, Scrap Lover, I don't need your dancin\nMister Cee I don't need you on the turntables\nAnt Live I don't need you collectin the dough\nAnd Little Daddy since you my brother\nGet yo' ass on in here\nCause we gettin ready to take things down the line\nHere we go one time\n\nPrepare yourself for MC terror\nAnd don't make the error of tryin to come near a\nRapper so smooth and swift with the gift of gab\nTo grab the mic, cause I'm sorta like\nVincent Price, but you never been so nice\nSo back up off me, I'm seperatin men from mice\nKickin ass in every committee, city to city\nUntil both shoes are shitty\nThe regulator innovator dominator creator of data\nPlus an imitator assassinator\nLyrics don't display a too don sweet\nHard as concrete, and always on beat\nSteppin to this, you're not allowed\nYou keep frontin on the stage like you're rockin the crowd\nSnatchin the microphone real proud\nBut your rhymes are so booty you should write em on White Cloud\nSo next up down the line, Scrap Lover\n\n[Scrap Lover]\nAiy-aiy-yo, the microphone's mine\nBut I prefer peace, so the road'll get rough when\nA toy MC, gets the heart to pull a bluff and\nThere's no laughter, cause the one that I'm after\nIs smashed, for that reason you have to\nMake sure each and every lyric is harmless\nCause if not, you won't be able to calm this\nBrother from Brooklyn, made to fit a groove\nAnd prepared for the unexpected, to make a move\nSo put up your girl, and let's see who's in trouble troop\nAnd if you got a sister, then make it a double scoop\nThe capital S the C, the R-A-P\nStands for me, cause I'm the\nOnly MC with an original rap style\nYou disagree, you get put on the Scrap pile\nSo stay off the set, with George and Jet-son\nYou never seen a dancer who rapped well you met one\nNow spin the Wheel of Fortunes or be wise and stay back\nCo-host my show, like Pat and don't Sa-jak shit\nOr get ate like oats and barley\nSave your Sweat for Keith, and the Beef for Charlie\nSo next up, goin down the line, Scoob Lover\n\n[Scoob Lover]\nYo, the microphone's mine\nIt's the S y'all, to the C y'all, double-O B y'all\nWell god damn it's me y'all\nJump back, kiss myself, I'm so fly\nSip a brew or two, cause yo, I don't get high\nI might wave hi..\n.. at a pretty young girl that walk by\nBut yo, you all that, you can't stop?\nA-with the weave in your head like a mop?\nYou must know karate, cause your face look chopped\nNow back to the subject of the matter\nI eat a lot of food, but I won't get fatter\nLet me see I'm slim, my hair is well trimmed\nAnd when I'm low-key I throw on a brim\nBut I'm not conceited, when hangin out I need it\nFor when trouble comes then I never have to meet it\nI'm intellectually spoken, I'm not jokin\nWhat are you, smokin?\nYou be hopin wishin and prayin\nTo be like Scoob but what are you sayin?\nWell it takes style, charisma, class\nFuck up on the Lover, and I bust your ass\nSo next up, movin down the line\nMister Cee\n\n[Mister Cee]\nYo, the microphone's mine\nMission, to make DJ's feel the wrath\nSo here's a paragraph, written on behalf\nOf the ruler, dictator, DJ ambassador\nMakin a massacre, you couldn't last through a\nRound of combat, where my left arm's at\nMy mouth with the mic in my hand, when I attack\nI shake and bake or fake a snake\nTake em and make em ache and flake, I break like an earthquake\nWhen I erupt, MC's I corrupt, to be blunt\nI'mma tear shit up\nSo next up goin down the line\nThe Little Daddy Shane\n\n[Little Daddy Shane]\nThe mic is all mine\nMC's crawl by when they see this tall guy\nSix foot three huh, nobody's small fry\nThe Little D-A double-D Y\nThe S-H-A-N-E, yes it's me\nYou better believe there's no comp and I'm certain\nSo if you try to battle me, then it's cur-tains\nI'm no joke, the wrong one to provoke\nOne false move and KERRRRRR-ROAK!\nSo take it easy and slide on greasy\nCause I'm more rougher than hair when it's peasy\nI'm more rougher than steak when it's raw\nSo keep that in mind, mon cherie amore\nCause I'm a lover you find quite young\nAnd Brooklyn New York, is where I'm from\nSo keep it on and you don't quit\nThat supercalafragilisticexpalidopeshit\nSo next up down the line, Ant Live\n\n[Ant Live]\nYo, the microphone's mine\nYeah I took it, I ain't gonna give it back\nAnd it's a fact that I can swing, I'm not a new jack\nGot the mic in a chokehold, you won't hear a peep\nThen I put it to sleep\nI see a lot of brothers got raisins in the place\nNot Al Pacino, I don't need a Scarface\nBut I know, if some shit goes down\nI'll turn the whole New York into Bucktown\nA 'Face ain't real Scar'red, cause I real hard\nAnd I ain't no bullshit bodyguard\nWalk the streets to New York and stay alive\nAll I need is my loaded four-five\nAnd sweet and deadly like a killer beehive\nAnd I can stalk in Fort Greene Park and survive...\nAnd my name is Ant Live!\n\n[Big Daddy Kane]\nNow that's what I'm talkin bout\nThat's EXACTLY what I'm talkin bout\nPut your weight on it fellas\nAnyway you can get back to work now\nGet back to your god damn jobs\nAnd we outta here,

Lover, I don't need your dancin\nMister Cee I don't need you on the turntables\nAnt Live I don't need you collectin the dough\nAnd Little Daddy since you my brother\nGet yo' ass on in here\nCause we gettin ready to take things down the line\nHere we go one time\n\nPrepare yourself for MC terror\nAnd don't make the error of tryin to come near a\nRapper so smooth and swift with the gift of gab\nTo grab the mic, cause I'm sorta like\nVincent Price, but you never been so nice\nSo back up off me, I'm seperatin men from mice\nKickin ass in every committee, city to city\nUntil both shoes are shitty\nThe regulator innovator dominator creator of data\nPlus an imitator assassinator\nLyrics don't display a too don sweet\nHard as concrete, and always on beat\nSteppin to this, you're not allowed\nYou keep frontin on the stage like you're rockin the crowd\nSnatchin the microphone real proud\nBut your rhymes are so booty you should write em on White Cloud\nSo next up down the line, Scrap Lover\n\n[Scrap Lover]\nAiy-aiy-yo, the microphone's mine\nBut I prefer peace, so the road'll get rough when\nA toy MC, gets the heart to pull a bluff and\nThere's no laughter, cause the one that I'm after\nIs smashed, for that reason you have to\nMake sure each and every lyric is harmless\nCause if not, you won't be able to calm this\nBrother from Brooklyn, made to fit a groove\nAnd prepared for the unexpected, to make a move\nSo put up your girl, and let's see who's in trouble troop\nAnd if you got a sister, then make it a double scoop\nThe capital S the C, the R-A-P\nStands for me, cause I'm the\nOnly MC with an original rap style\nYou disagree, you get put on the Scrap pile\nSo stay off the set, with George and Jet-son\nYou never seen a dancer who rapped well you met one\nNow spin the Wheel of Fortunes or be wise and stay back\nCo-host my show, like Pat and don't Sa-jak shit\nOr get ate like oats and barley\nSave your Sweat for Keith, and the Beef for Charlie\nSo next up, goin down the line, Scoob Lover\n\n[Scoob Lover]\nYo, the microphone's mine\nIt's the S y'all, to the C y'all, double-O B y'all\nWell god damn it's me y'all\nJump back, kiss myself, I'm so fly\nSip a brew or two, cause yo, I don't get high\nI might wave hi..\n.. at a pretty young girl that walk by\nBut yo, you all that, you can't stop?\nA-with the weave in your head like a mop?\nYou must know karate, cause your face look chopped\nNow back to the subject of the matter\nI eat a lot of food, but I won't get fatter\nLet me see I'm slim, my hair is well trimmed\nAnd when I'm low-key I throw on a brim\nBut I'm not conceited, when hangin out I need it\nFor when trouble comes then I never have to meet it\nI'm intellectually spoken, I'm not jokin\nWhat are you, smokin?\nYou be hopin wishin and prayin\nTo be like Scoob but what are you sayin?\nWell it takes style, charisma, class\nFuck up on the Lover, and I bust your ass\nSo next up, movin down the line\nMister Cee\n\n[Mister Cee]\nYo, the microphone's mine\nMission, to make DJ's feel the wrath\nSo here's a paragraph, written on behalf\nOf the ruler, dictator, DJ ambassador\nMakin a massacre, you couldn't last through a\nRound of combat, where my left arm's at\nMy mouth with the mic in my hand, when I attack\nI shake and bake or fake a snake\nTake em and make em ache and flake, I break like an earthquake\nWhen I erupt, MC's I corrupt, to be blunt\nI'mma tear shit up\nSo next up goin down the line\nThe Little Daddy Shane\n\n[Little Daddy Shane]\nThe mic is all mine\nMC's crawl by when they see this tall guy\nSix foot three huh, nobody's small fry\nThe Little D-A double-D Y\nThe S-H-A-N-E, yes it's me\nYou better believe there's no comp and I'm certain\nSo if you try to battle me, then it's cur-tains\nI'm no joke, the wrong one to provoke\nOne false move and KERRRRRR-ROAK!\nSo take it easy and slide on greasy\nCause I'm more rougher than hair when it's peasy\nI'm more rougher than steak when it's raw\nSo keep that in mind, mon cherie amore\nCause I'm a lover you find quite young\nAnd Brooklyn New York, is where I'm from\nSo keep it on and you don't quit\nThat supercalafragilisticexpalidopeshit\nSo next up down the line, Ant Live\n\n[Ant Live]\nYo, the microphone's mine\nYeah I took it, I ain't gonna give it back\nAnd it's a fact that I can swing, I'm not a new jack\nGot the mic in a chokehold, you won't hear a peep\nThen I put it to sleep\nI see a lot of brothers got raisins in the place\nNot Al Pacino, I don't need a Scarface\nBut I know, if some shit goes down\nI'll turn the whole New York into Bucktown\nA 'Face ain't real Scar'red, cause I real hard\nAnd I ain't no bullshit bodyguard\nWalk the streets to New York and stay alive\nAll I need is my loaded four-five\nAnd sweet and deadly like a killer beehive\nAnd I can stalk in Fort Greene Park and survive...\nAnd my name is Ant Live!\n\n[Big Daddy Kane]\nNow that's what I'm talkin bout\nThat's EXACTLY what I'm talkin bout\nPut your weight on it fellas\nAnyway you can get back to work now\nGet back to your god damn jobs\nAnd we outta here, love peace and hairgrease"}}, {"title": "Children R

world\nYes the children, be buildin, each boy and girl\nCause you are the cream of the planet earth\nThe new birth, now take that for what it's worth\nAnd give the child room, to blossom and bloom\nLivin large, it's your destiny to consume\nTo take flight and ignite to a brand new height\nCause that's your goal in life - am I right? (Yeah!)\nTo start reachin, come on each and every\nSingle one of y'all comprehend what I'm teachin\nI said listen up, listen up, listen up youngster\nLearn from a lesson that the Big Daddy brung ya\nIt's nothin but knowledge, I shall bring to you\nAnd I'm not Mr. Rogers or Captain Kangaroo, but I know\n\n\"children, children\" - \"are the future\" (variations 4X)\n\n\"children, children\" Where we goin now?\nTake my hand my child, and let me show you how\nCause I'm here to help..\n.. those who need Knowledge of Self\nYoung brothers and sisters, considered the cream\nThat must rise to the top and fulfill the dream\nAnd there are desires that we all want to achieve\nBut remember, respect is most greatest to receive\nAnd we don't have to gain it by bein TOUGH\nOr sellin our own kind that cooked white stuff\nSo bring your negative mind from out of the shade\nFind your true self and let's all get paid, because\n\n\"children, children\" - \"are the future\" (variations 4X)\n\nPeople, people, why we live illegal?\nYour life just ends short and you know that there's no sequel\n(sequel) They'll say that it was fun while it lasted\nYou run wild, stickin up and gettin blasted\nPregnant girls livin solo, on the welfare\nCause your so-called man said go to hell dere\nAnd young brothers that could be tryin to rap\nInstead, are out boostin clothes at the Gap\nNow what kind of life is that for a child?\nRunnin wild livin foul, hey, change your lifestyle\nGet some knowledge, and open your eyes\nJust take a little bit of time\nHow fully you'll come to realize, that\n\n\"children, children\" - \"are the future\" (variations 4X)\n\n[Kane * singing *]\nI believe the children are the future\nTeach them well and let them lead the way\nShow them all of the beauty they posess inside\nGive them, a sense of pride\nTo make it easier, let the children laughter\nRemind us how we used to be", "image":

you put your armpits in the drum machine\nGood God\nBreak me off some of that\nCome on\n\n[Verse 1]\nEasy Mo, just let the beat rock\nFrom your sweet stock\nTo bounce the complete block\nMake everyone, on the street flock\nTo this here rhythm\nMusic'll hit 'em, get 'em\nMy lyrics'll fit 'em, when I get with 'em\nThey'll admit I'm, smokin' like bags of ism\nThe way that I keep amazin'\nY'all don't even know who you're facin', pa\nThe Kane has flipped more tracks than a racing car\nThe one who created it and many others imitated it\nI heard your rap style, kid - I hated it\nLet me show you how, look here, now check my style\nWhat I spit out, it'll raise your brow, make you say \"wow\"\nBa-da-bow-bow, come on, now let's get down\nAnd sway this way when you hear the music play\nHip-hop hooray, this is what I want you to say\nHey\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm in love with Big Daddy Kane\nHe makes the party swing\nHe turns the mother out\nAnd rips apart things\n\nThen I

down\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow, what's this BS you're sayin'?\nAnd don't try to act like Martin now, with all that 'I was just playin'\nNo need to grief or mourn, cause now The Beef is On\nBoom-bap boo-bow-bow - kid, your teeth is gone\nJust cause you rap, that don't mean that ya catchin' wreck with me\nYou step to this, I give your mic a vasectomy\nI only know one person that can come next to me\nNo, that's a tattle\nCause, I can't count my own shadow\nA battle? I gots to have it\nUnless you're gonna rob me like they did Whittaker when he fought Chavez\nCause tryin' to go against the Kane rappin'\nIs like a pimp tryna pull a nun - ain't nothin' happenin'\nClear the way for the one, champ-ion, true black don\nWho begun gettin' the job done, take a look, hon\nBack up, son, you know you can't get none\nCome on, I'm on a whole 'nother level of rap\nAnd it's like that, now show me where the party at\nUh huh\n\n[Hook]\nDa-da-da-daaa-da\nYeah, I like the way it sound\nAnd I love the way it's goin' down\nDa-da-da-daaa-da\nYou know I like the way it sound\nAnd I love how it's goin' down\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe B-I-G D-A-D Y, no, back up and add another D\nThen back to the K to the A to the N to the E\nLive from New York, the one and only\nI give it to you raw for my homies\nUh, and to the ladies: I take em lookin' somethin' fine\nAnd don't mind if we bump 'n grind\nIf you're with me, jump in line\nBecause, if in my wallet I can find one prophylactic\nThen you better believe girl, that you gonna get your ass dicked\nHard type of rappers extinct, like a dinosaur\nThe kind you saw the rhyme before\nBut now you never find no more\nSteppin' to the Kane with some drama to be startin'\nBecause I put 'em all on ice, like Tonya Harding\nBack up, boy, I got the whole convoy\nRollin' with me on a mission, that's to seek and destroy\nSo, to all the people that's been tryin' to talk about me\nYou better change your name to 5000, cause you're Audi\nAnd if you bring on your crew, I'm steppin' to them too\nJust put the beat on and watch how I swim through\nThe groove, with more style than a backstroke\nDrivin' past my competition, like cab drivers do black folks\nThat's the way I move, I always stayed the Smooth\nOperator with data watin' for you to play a groove\nTo turn it out without a doubt, and show what I'm about\nGood lookin, Brooklyn, yeah, we in the house\nSham on\n\n[Hook]\nDa-da-da-daaa-da\nYeah, I like the way it sound\nAnd I love the way it's goin' down\nDa-da-da-daaa-da\nYou know I like the way it sound\nAnd I just love the way it's goin' down"}}, {"title": "On the Move", "album": "It's a Big Daddy Thing", "year": "1989-09-19", "lyrics": "Chorus: (all together)\n\nWell, here we are\nUnited just for you\nOur flat-top cuts are new\nBecause we're on the move\n\nVerse 1 (Big Daddy Kane):\n\nNa-na-na now girls step up, the quick ones kept up\nThe slow ones need to pep up to keep Big Daddy's rep up\nCause I don't let up or get up or even set up\nOn a a speak freak, I know how to make you shut up\nGasp your breath as you huff and puff\nThe Big Daddy got more than enough good stuff\nCause I'm just like secret when it comes to trimin'\nStrong enough for a man but made for women\nSo come one, come all, I'm not about bein' picky\nIt only takes a hickey to make you want a quickie\nFrom the Cameo haircut man that's dark and lovely\nSmooth and suave, that's why girls dream of me\nAnd not to flaunt, I love a flirt with a skirt\nAnd after a concert, a little neeeaaah don't hurt\nJust to hear the girls screamin' out wild, G\nYou're not a Jungle Brother, but that's some Jimbrowski\nI'm like a pimp, see, and iff you tempt me\nI can fill up any girls that's empty\nGive you somethin' that's mighy and strong\nBut ladies, don't get me wrong\nBecause you say that I love 'em and leave 'em, but no, I please ya\nAnd then catch amnesia\nBut the party people can't be denied\nSo I remember those who's on my side\n\n(Repeat chorus)\n\nInterlude 1:\n\nMister Cee cuts and scratches \"Scoob Lover, my brother.\"\n\nVerse 2 (Scoob Lover):\n\nThe mic goes around like a 40 ounce\nNow, I'm-a take a sip, now it's time to bounce\nI won't get tipsy, I don't drink and talk\nAnd, no, I'm not a hoddlum by the way I walk\nCause I'm one hype, one brown-skinned brother\nFor those who don't know me, I'm (who?)

ladies that's clean and legit\nAs long as I got a face, you got a place o sit\nNo tokens for heart-broken turnstiles\nNo remarks or regrets, but I'll burn while\nThose that's destined to question for a new thing\nJoin us in harmony together as we sing\nFor all the ladies determined that once was\nSo jealous, stop searchin' now cause....\n\n(Repeat chorus)\n\n(Mister Cee cuts and

new\nBecause we're on the move\n\nVerse 1 (Big Daddy Kane):\n\nNa-na-na now girls step up, the quick ones kept up\nThe slow ones need to pep up to keep Big Daddy's rep up\nCause I don't let up or get up or even set up\nOn a a speak freak, I know how to make you shut up\nGasp your breath as you huff and puff\nThe Big Daddy got more than enough good stuff\nCause I'm just like secret when it comes to trimin'\nStrong enough for a man but made for women\nSo come one, come all, I'm not about bein' picky\nIt only takes a hickey to make you want a quickie\nFrom the Cameo haircut man that's dark and lovely\nSmooth and suave, that's why girls dream of me\nAnd not to flaunt, I love a flirt with a skirt\nAnd after a concert, a little neeeaaah don't hurt\nJust to hear the girls screamin' out wild, G\nYou're not a Jungle Brother, but that's some Jimbrowski\nI'm like a pimp, see, and iff you tempt me\nI can fill up any girls that's empty\nGive you somethin' that's mighy and strong\nBut ladies, don't get me wrong\nBecause you say that I love 'em and leave 'em, but no, I please ya\nAnd then catch amnesia\nBut the party people can't be denied\nSo I remember those who's on my side\n\n(Repeat chorus)\n\nInterlude 1:\n\nMister Cee cuts and scratches \"Scoob Lover, my brother.\"\n\nVerse 2 (Scoob Lover):\n\nThe mic goes around like a 40 ounce\nNow, I'm-a take a sip, now it's time to bounce\nI won't get tipsy, I don't drink and talk\nAnd, no, I'm not a hoddlum by the way I walk\nCause I'm one hype, one brown-skinned brother\nFor those who don't know me, I'm (who?) Scoob Lover\nA jolly good fellow, flowin' with the mellow\nFor all the choice cuties, I'd love to say \"Hello\"\nSo take away the 3, let's stick to 1, 2\nMe and you, now here's a clue what we could do\nIt begins with an S and ends with an X\nHmmm, not the number 6, so guess what's next\nSo girls, don't barge, don't blink, be still\nCause it's about time for Scoob to get ill\nRemeber you dissed, now you wanna kiss\nWrite me fan letters, sayin' that you miss\nThere's only one rap dance, the cool romancer\nIf I had a million dollars, I'd try to cure cancer\nBut I'm only here to get illey, ha\nNow, I'm drug free and I don't smoke Phillies\nSo come here, shorty, go buy me a 40\nAnd make sure it's cold so the crew can get naughty\n\n(Repeat chorus)\n\nInterlude 2:\n\nMister Cee cuts and scratches \"Scrap Lover, my other.\"\n\nVerse 3 (Scrap Lover):\n\nYou get jacked if you ever try to nap\nOna a rap from Scrap because you know there's no haps\nNow, right from where I left off, to all those who stepped off\nYou know you had it comin', the blame is what you slept off\n?Destruction played a part on roll, here's so to say.?\nYou can't mislead me. Why? Cause I know the way\nAlways gave headahces, never known for heartaches\nTime and effort, huh, that's what a star takes\nLet me give you a true piece of mind\nCause this rare species is so hard to find\nI'm custom-made for all the ladies with guts\nA tall box of hair or rather cameo cuts\nDraggin' tattoes is what the girls found\nTwo on m chest, one draggin' on the ground\nTo all the young ladies that's clean and legit\nAs long as I got a face, you got a place o sit\nNo tokens for heart-broken turnstiles\nNo remarks or regrets, but I'll burn while\nThose that's destined to question for a new thing\nJoin us in harmony together as we sing\nFor all the ladies determined that once was\nSo jealous, stop searchin' now cause....\n\n(Repeat chorus)\n\n(Mister Cee cuts and scratches)\n\nOutro (Big Daddy Kane)\n\nYou don't stop, you don't stop\nYou keep on to the break of dawn"}}, {"title": "That's How I Did 'Em", "album": "Daddy's Home", "year": "1994-09-13", "lyrics": "Daddy Daddy tell me a story of how you took out that wack MC\nNo Daddy, tell them how you beat down that bootlegger\nDaddy Daddy tell us a story!\n\n[Big Daddy Kane]\nHeh heh, alright, alright, alright y'all OK\nCome on y'all, crowd around Daddy now OK?

then I jumped on the brother, with rage\nCrushed his ribcage, damn did he get slayed\nCause I don't think he even know whatever hit him\nBootleggers beware, cause yeah I did em\n\nThat's how I did em (HUH) that's how I did em (HAH)\nThat's how I did em (HUH) that's how I did em (HAH)\nThat's how I did em (HUH) that's how I did em (HAH)\nThat's how I did em (HEYYYYYYYY)\n\n[Verse 3]\nGive it your best shot, bring it with all you got\nAnd watch the bombs I drop just rock your knot\nCause it ain't wise to address me\nI wouldn't advise a schoolteacher to test me\nCause I don't just do em, I run through em\nAnd I don't just hurt, uh uh, I body work em\nLyrical torture, never could support ya\nFor steppin to me, agony is what it brought ya\nCause you never seen this type of lyrical genius\nThat could never be touched, and I mean this\nSo one love, I'mma leave you with the rhythm\nAin't no need to go off, cause yo hon know I did em\n\nThat's how I did em (HUH) that's how I did em

record real loose\nAnd uhh, test test test test, oh yes\nI wanna bless the mic, I caress with finesse\nBack off the microphone, you can't wreck it none\nI'm like a nine, and you're just a Naked Gun\nSome type of new jack, steppin in the area\nKind of reminds me of Eddie Murphy, Coming to America\nBut you can't approach this, rhymes are too ferocious\nDo the knowledge as I quote this\nFreddie Krueger, walkin on Kane's street\nFive chapters and I still ain't been beat\nBout time I turned the microphone loose\nAnyone after me is just an excuse\nEven the level of the devil or Exorcist\nCan't get next to this\nThis is mayhem, so competition, say when\nYou're thinkin that you're ready, so I can just play him\nOr them, no matter the quan-tity, you don't want to be\nIn this battle, so just flee\nCause I leave em panickin when I start damagin\nKickin this swift, leaves you stiff, like a mannequin\nAnd frozen, this is a mind explosion\nAs the chosen flows in, the competition throws in\nThe towel, my sharp tongue is like a license\nI strike like Mike, Tyson I be icin\nBreakin the mic in half, just like a psychopath\nBut still smooth and cool, just like a draft\nLeave the metro scared and petrol\nAin't No Half-Steppin', so I don't sweat no MC\nCause Michael Jackson couldn't say it clearer\nMy only comp is the man in the mirror\nSo any pretender, you never been to\nThe death zone, this is the wrath, do not enter\nThese ain't the grounds for MC's to be wanderin\nThese is the grounds that the Kane is conquerin\nLyrics are bright and recite on the mic to excite\nDelight, ignite, a bright light and a fright night\nFor types who bite, to be quite like\nThe man with mic swingin' all tight, but can't get it right\nYou're just a sloppy, cheap carbon copy\nSent to ride off in the sun, said Kemosabi\nAs the Kane remains everlasting\nWith lyrics that's fast relief like aspirin\nSo allow me to relieve, or breathe contact\nYour brain and remain like hairweave\nCause I can reach each participant with a speech\nThat will teach, and have em hangin' like a leech\nAnd yes still puttin rappers in fear\nSo hold it right there, cause this is a nightmare\nAs I cause a killer scene, and cut like a guillotine\nAny thoughts you had about winnin is still a dream\nOr more like a fantasy, tell me why can't you see\nThere ain't a way that you can touch or stand on me\nYou talk about how many rappers you slayed\nBut I'm like a renegade, so I never been afraid\nSo don't say hi to this Asiatic descendant\nJust say peace and everything'll be splendid\nPeace!\n\nMister Cee, put

I caress with finesse\nBack off the microphone, you can't wreck it none\nI'm like a nine, and you're just a Naked Gun\nSome type of new jack, steppin in the area\nKind of reminds me of Eddie Murphy, Coming to America\nBut you can't approach this, rhymes are too ferocious\nDo the knowledge as I quote this\nFreddie Krueger, walkin on Kane's street\nFive chapters and I still ain't been beat\nBout time I turned the microphone loose\nAnyone after me is just an excuse\nEven the level of the devil or Exorcist\nCan't get next to this\nThis is mayhem, so competition, say when\nYou're thinkin that you're ready, so I can just play him\nOr them, no matter the quan-tity, you don't want to be\nIn this battle, so just flee\nCause I leave em panickin when I start damagin\nKickin this swift, leaves you stiff, like a mannequin\nAnd frozen, this is a mind explosion\nAs the chosen flows in, the competition throws in\nThe towel, my sharp tongue is like a license\nI strike like Mike, Tyson I be icin\nBreakin the mic in half, just like a psychopath\nBut still smooth and cool, just like a draft\nLeave the metro scared and petrol\nAin't No Half-Steppin', so I don't sweat no MC\nCause Michael Jackson couldn't say it clearer\nMy only comp is the man in the mirror\nSo any pretender, you never been to\nThe death zone, this is the wrath, do not enter\nThese ain't the grounds for MC's to be wanderin\nThese is the grounds that the Kane is conquerin\nLyrics are bright and recite on the mic to excite\nDelight, ignite, a bright light and a fright night\nFor types who bite, to be quite like\nThe man with mic swingin' all tight, but can't get it right\nYou're just a sloppy, cheap carbon copy\nSent to ride off in the sun, said Kemosabi\nAs the Kane remains everlasting\nWith lyrics

by Big Daddy Kane]\n\n[Intro: Big Daddy Kane]\nSomething about the things that we do\nTo make it funky for you\nAnd as you listen to the rhyme\nYou'll see that it just gets better with time\n\n[Verse 1: Big Daddy Kane]\nRappers stepped to me, but they didn't get none\nI'm the Kane so you know the outcome\nThe microphone crooner, should have set the tone sooner\nHip hop to me is like boxing to Roy Jones Junior\nThe genuine, search and you'll find\nThat on the microphone I can handle mine\nHere's a view to a kill as I flipped the skill\nWhen it's time to rock the mic like Al Skratch, I get ill\nI come equipped to fight and if I flip tonight\nEffects on emcees are similar to kryptonite\nThe water flows that be hard to distinguish\nIt's best to relinquish, you don't want the God to bring this\nI'm marvelous at the art of this\nEven if you got assist, stepping to me is a lot of risk\nI release skills that's abundant\nTo explode and drop on you like Flight 800, what\n\n[Hook: Kelly German]\nKeep it moving, world renown\nShowing and proving, that we can hold it down\nKeep it moving, world renown\nShowing and proving, that we can hold it down\n\n[Verse 2: Big Daddy Kane]\nHere's a percentage of that old vintage\nMacaroni flow but its more than an image\nDon't let the smooth taste fool ya, let me school ya\nOn what it is, straight up, square biz\nSwift maneuvering to crush the crew you bring\nLast thing them want tell me is Kane go do your thing\nWho the king? Asiatic non-equivalent to any\nPlus I play the game a more harder way than Penny\nThe plan that I mobilize for dough to rise is no surprise\nThat it comes from what I vocalize\nI'm the best you can get as I hit you with\nThe stroke of death, and I ain't even broke a sweat\nBut this is where I draw the line, you're sure to find\nLyrics I be dropping is too much for the mortal mind\nWhat's being caused is many emcees I'm seeing lost\nThe hip hop laws should be reinforced\nYou made a record this year, oh you're hot?\nSomething fishy about your style, who flow you got?\nYou thought that you could hold me down? No, you're not\nNow back up off me, here I come to blow the spot\n\n[Hook: Kelly German]\nKeep it moving, world renown\nShowing and proving, that we can hold it down\nKeep it moving, world renown\nShowing and proving, that we can hold it down\n\n[Verse 3: Big Daddy Kane]\nAlright, here I come to get some\nBut instead, you don't want the love to spread\nI heard that jealousy and envy is a dumb one's tool\nSo Daddy says nothing, he keeps his cool\nI been through your tribulations and conflicts\nAnything possible to keep me out the mix\nBut ease back, boy you better freeze that\nWhere my rivalries lack, I'm still nice with these Black\nI rap with the safety cap so that you don't get it twisted\nAnd be another statistic\nHow many more to try is sure to die\nSlaughter I, all that playa-hating only makes me fortify\nTo get the papers to me is a necessity\nAnd I don't want a piece of the pie, I want the recipe\nI can't lose with what I use\nI'm the reason why the lady sings the blues, don't get it confused\n\n[Hook: Kelly German]\nKeep it moving, world renown\nShowing and proving, that we can hold it down\nKeep it moving, world renown\nShowing and proving, that we can hold it down\n\n[Outro: Big Daddy Kane]\nHold it down, baby, hold it down\nHold it down, baby, hold it down\nHold it down, baby, hold it down\nUh, uh, uh, uh", "image":

do\nTo make it funky for you\nAnd as you listen to the rhyme\nYou'll see that it just gets better with time\n\n[Verse 1: Big Daddy Kane]\nRappers stepped to me, but they didn't get none\nI'm the Kane so you know the outcome\nThe microphone crooner, should have set the tone sooner\nHip hop to me is like boxing to Roy Jones Junior\nThe genuine, search and you'll find\nThat on the microphone I can handle mine\nHere's a view to a kill as I flipped the skill\nWhen it's time to rock the mic like Al Skratch, I get ill\nI come equipped to fight and if I flip tonight\nEffects on emcees are similar to kryptonite\nThe water flows that be hard to distinguish\nIt's best to relinquish, you don't want the God to bring this\nI'm marvelous at the art of this\nEven if you got assist, stepping to me is a lot of risk\nI release skills that's abundant\nTo explode and drop on you like Flight 800, what\n\n[Hook: Kelly German]\nKeep it moving, world renown\nShowing and proving, that we can hold it down\nKeep it moving, world renown\nShowing and proving, that we can hold it down\n\n[Verse 2: Big Daddy Kane]\nHere's a percentage of that old vintage\nMacaroni flow but its more than an image\nDon't let the smooth taste fool ya, let me school ya\nOn what it is, straight up, square biz\nSwift maneuvering to crush the crew you bring\nLast thing them want tell me is Kane go do your thing\nWho the king? Asiatic non-equivalent to any\nPlus I play the game a more harder way than Penny\nThe plan that I mobilize for dough to rise is no surprise\nThat it comes from what I vocalize\nI'm the best you can get as I hit you with\nThe stroke of death, and I ain't even broke a sweat\nBut this is where I draw the line, you're sure to find\nLyrics I be dropping is too much for the mortal mind\nWhat's being caused is many emcees I'm seeing lost\nThe hip hop laws should be reinforced\nYou made a record this year, oh you're hot?\nSomething fishy about your style, who flow you got?\nYou thought that you could hold me down? No, you're not\nNow back up off me, here I come to blow the spot\n\n[Hook: Kelly German]\nKeep it moving, world renown\nShowing and proving, that we can hold it down\nKeep it moving, world renown\nShowing and proving, that we can hold it down\n\n[Verse 3: Big Daddy Kane]\nAlright, here I come to get some\nBut instead, you don't want the love to spread\nI heard that jealousy and envy is a dumb one's tool\nSo Daddy says nothing, he keeps his cool\nI been through your tribulations and conflicts\nAnything possible to keep me out the mix\nBut ease back, boy you better freeze that\nWhere my rivalries lack, I'm still nice with these Black\nI rap with the safety cap so that you don't get it twisted\nAnd be another statistic\nHow many more to try is sure to die\nSlaughter I, all that playa-hating only makes me fortify\nTo get the papers to me is a necessity\nAnd I don't want a piece of the pie, I want the recipe\nI can't lose with what I use\nI'm the reason why the lady sings the blues, don't get it confused\n\n[Hook: Kelly German]\nKeep it moving, world renown\nShowing and proving, that we can hold it down\nKeep it moving, world renown\nShowing and proving, that we can hold it down\n\n[Outro: Big Daddy Kane]\nHold it down, baby, hold it down\nHold it down, baby, hold it down\nHold it down, baby, hold it down\nUh, uh, uh, uh"}}, {"title": "To Be Your Man", "album": "It's a Big Daddy Thing", "year": "1989-09-19", "lyrics": "Mmmm, mmm, mmm!\n\n..\n\nMy my my my my my my my my\nThis must be what you call, love at first sight\nWhen you commit yourself to someone\nAnd don't even know wrong from right (wrong from right)\nLooks like my feelings been united with you baby\nBut maybe just a little bit too soon\nI realized that hearts get broken, sweetheart\nI couldn't stand the wound (can't stand the wound)\nSo I put mines in your hands girl\nAnd it's all yours my dear\nBut you got to be gentle, cause it's fragile see\nThat means handle with care (handle with care)\nHeh, reminisce on how I first met you\nYou remember -- backstage at my show\nI thought that I was the star until I saw you\n(but I did not love her) (I did not love her)\nEscapin from the crowd to be alone witchu\nCause I had oh so much to say\nAs we sat down in my dressin room girl, huh\nAnd just talked the entire night away\nFrom that moment on I felt that I knew you\nJust like the back of my hand (I love you, I love you)\nLoved you like I never loved another (I loved you)\nAnd dreamt of bein your man\n\n*sung* How would it feel?

To be your man?

goin\n\n[Shane]\nIt's gone!\nCause Lil' Daddy's like a rap helter skelter\nA bad mother..\n\n[Kane]\nChill Shane, respect your elders\nMy younger one, UHH, tall and yellow\nAiyyo, I got you covered like an umbrella\n\n[Shane]\nWell, I got a little rap thing I wanna breeze through\n\n[Kane]\nSo may I release you?\n\n[Shane]\nOh oh, please do\n\n[Kane]\nSo Lil' Daddy, my ace, my brother\nGet on the mic and let's rock with one another\n\n[Shane]\nAnd, here comes the six foot four, the rough and raw\nTo blow up the mic with rhymes you like\nI strike the stage in a rage and burn just like a twelve gauge\nShotgun, cause son, the Shane is not the one\nThe noise bringer, humdinger, funky rhyme stinger\nBring your girl to my show and I'ma swing her\nThe Lil' Daddy got it down pat, YEAH\nI'm like the name Heavy D, I sound fat\nWord for word, line for line, UH\nI gets mine and show I'm poetically in-clined\nIf rap was made by ? then redeemed because\nYou ain't got no ahhhhhice creeeeeeeeam\nSo take a seat in the rear\nDon't dare to compare, cause I swear, you gets nothin here\nThe way you see me knock out the next brother\nYou'd think my moms had a talk with LL's mother, huh\nAiy-yi-yi-yah, momma mia\nMan I burn the next MC like gonorrhea\nKnock the boots on a girl named Althea\nThen pull her friend by the name of Maria\n\n[Kane]\nWell I got a little rap thing I wanna breeze through\n\n[Shane]\nSo may I release you?\n\n[Kane]\nOh oh, please do\n\n[Shane]\nSo Big Daddy, my ace, my brother\nGet on the mic, and let's rap with one another\n\n[Kane]\nWhen I grab the microphone and shout\nYou gotta spread out, spread out, spread out, spread out\nI'm ready to rip it apart, I hit em with one of the rhymes\nI'm rough in a flash, trash, bash, crash, smash slash mash\nRun for shelter, no one can help ya\nYou pushed up on a heavyweight, when your rhymes are welter-\n-weight that's right, wait, because you're not fitted\n*singing* You're never gonna get it, never gonna get it\nUHH, I'm what you call a rap legend\nAnd definitely the last MC to be present\nDon't even try to take mines\nYou fuckin new jack, you still got price tags on your rhymes\nYo what's that sayin that Hammer says uhh\nU Can't Touch This, just like a pimple yo I'ma bust this\nI'm like Steven Seagal, Out for Justice\nAs for competition, pssssssh, what's this?\nYou're not prepared to, rappers are scared to\nConfront this, cause you know damn well you don't want this\nSome good advice is just break out\nBefore I treat you like a fast food restaurant and take-out\nAs soon as I see the microphone yo I'ma, seize that\nSqueeze that, a battle, you better, freeze that\nCause if you go through the Wrath of Kane, uhh\nNot even Lisa Fischer can ease the pain, so\n\n[K] Brother man, brother.. man\n[S] Uh-huh, brother man, brother.. man\n[K] Yo, brother man, brother mega-man, UHH!\n[S] A brother man, brother mega-man, yeah!\n[K] Brother man, brother man..\n[S] Ha hah!  Brother man, brother.. man, yeah!\n[K] Brother man, brother MAN, aowww!\n[S] A brother man, brother.. man\n\n[both]\nRUFFFFFFFFFFF!"}}, {"title": "Terra N Ya Era", "album": "Veteranz Day", "year": "1998-04-28", "lyrics": "You looking in the mouth of madness, skilled out since I had this\nI'm talking bout nothing but pure D badness\nMy acceleration is compatible to a bima\nMy pockets looking greener, from the funky cold medina\nDon't tell me bout the things that you done did cause I done did it\nDon't tell me bout the skins that you done hit, cause I done hit it\nAnd once I rock these, with a style that's cock deis\nGood God, I get the crowd together like knock knees\nNow, I don't act hard, I just mack hard\nBaggin' video looking honeys with the big back yard\nYes lord, girls I'm gamin' leaving the microphone flamin'\nThrowing up hip-hop signs cause that's the set that I be claimin'\nGuerilla war fares for those who love to pull your card\nGrimies from Fort Green to Malcolm X Boulevard\nNow, if that's what you're hoping then it's the wrong things you're scopin'\nI may not rap bout slittin no throats but trust me kid I'll get you open\n\nVerse 2\nHere comes a taste of the rawness, like you never saw this\nOnce I grip the cordless, my victory is flawless\nChaos and havoc, lyrically psychopathic\nAt times get pornographic, lord man I gots to have it\nThen I commit to hit you with this composite that's ultimate\nToo legit splendid come get wit' it for your comfort\nBut then sloppily, rappers try to copy me\nTake pieces of my property, and use it all unproperly\nAnd probably, been focusing a while to copy my style\nBut child what I'll compile is too versatile\nI'm too superior, it's sort of like comparing a\nSpanking new Desert Eagle to a rusty little derringer\nBut skip the tool, let's try to deal here with the jewel\nThat I'm droppin on you, now let me take you all to school\nYou see, to graduate in hip-hop you must be smart\nAnd no you don't have to know how to paint to make your rhymes a form of art\nPoetry and literature is what makes this English fanatic\nNow dig this, I drop science but still deal with mathematics\nAnd since I don't be dealing with what's considered a mystery\nI learned the dead presidents to pass American History\nGot my degree in rapology\nHip-hop had to set me free, look mom, a real emcee\nSo you want yours now, well don't get caught with your drawers down\nCause word life, this industry is half corrupt just like the Dogg Pound\n\nVerse 3\nRap godfather\nOh goodness gracious, you better make it spacious\nFor the vivacious, ostentatious, who feel courageous?\nI put it on them using my tongue as a sword\nBut at times get broader than broad for those who insist to get floored\nWhatever it takes to see your nerve gone, and word born\nBlack Caesar gonna get his swerve on\nMy name should be referred to in medical terms\nCause I get way up in the cut and I'm talking way worse than germs\nYou like to chase it playin catch like Tom & Jerry\nBut on the contrary, I'd rather sip the Dom Peri\nLay back in harmony, because it's so bizarre to see\nThat all the hard core rappers are slowly turning R&B\nWell pardon me, you contradict yo'self, I see you not perfect yo'self\nYou like that type music yo'self, stick yo'self\nWhat happened to black men of pride 'nuff men have died\nNowadays what's been applied, in hip-hop is genocide\nThat's when the rappers go get the clappers\nCan't you see they trying to strap us just to trap us, good god it's backwards\nOne nation under a groove, that's how we move\nIt's time to teach the youth get it together show and prove\nMe no run with the gun or speak of none for action\nWhen you get done scream I'm the one, it looks like an illusion\nI deal with equality so never call my brethren son\nYes mon, me got mad flava just like jerk chicken", "image": "https://images.genius.com/55a075f6632f5b5a223681bd3f7a7ca8.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Big Daddy

style that's cock deis\nGood God, I get the crowd together like knock knees\nNow, I don't act hard, I just mack hard\nBaggin' video looking honeys with the big back yard\nYes lord, girls I'm gamin' leaving the microphone flamin'\nThrowing up hip-hop signs cause that's the set that I be claimin'\nGuerilla war fares for those who love to pull your card\nGrimies from Fort Green to Malcolm X Boulevard\nNow, if that's what you're hoping then it's the wrong things you're scopin'\nI may not rap bout slittin no throats but trust me kid I'll get you open\n\nVerse 2\nHere comes a taste of the rawness, like you never saw this\nOnce I grip the cordless, my victory is flawless\nChaos and havoc, lyrically psychopathic\nAt times get pornographic, lord man I gots to have it\nThen I commit to hit you with this composite that's ultimate\nToo legit splendid come get wit' it for your comfort\nBut then sloppily, rappers try to copy me\nTake pieces of my property, and use it all unproperly\nAnd probably, been focusing a while to copy my style\nBut child what I'll compile is too versatile\nI'm too superior, it's sort of like comparing a\nSpanking new Desert Eagle to a rusty little derringer\nBut skip the tool, let's try to deal here with the jewel\nThat I'm droppin on you, now let me take you all to school\nYou see, to graduate in hip-hop you must be smart\nAnd no you don't have to know how to paint to make your rhymes a form of art\nPoetry and literature is what makes this English fanatic\nNow dig this, I drop science but still deal with mathematics\nAnd since I don't be dealing with what's considered a mystery\nI learned the dead presidents to pass American History\nGot my degree in rapology\nHip-hop had to set me free, look mom, a real emcee\nSo you want yours now, well don't get caught with your drawers down\nCause word life, this industry is half corrupt just like the Dogg Pound\n\nVerse 3\nRap godfather\nOh goodness gracious, you better make it spacious\nFor the vivacious, ostentatious, who feel courageous?\nI put it on them using my tongue as a sword\nBut at times get broader than broad for those who insist to get floored\nWhatever it takes to see your nerve gone, and word born\nBlack Caesar gonna get his swerve on\nMy name should be referred to in medical terms\nCause I get way up in the cut and I'm talking way worse than germs\nYou like to chase it playin catch like Tom & Jerry\nBut on the contrary, I'd rather sip the Dom Peri\nLay back in harmony, because it's so bizarre to see\nThat all the hard core rappers are slowly turning R&B\nWell pardon me, you contradict yo'self, I see you not perfect yo'self\nYou like that type music yo'self, stick yo'self\nWhat happened to black men of pride 'nuff men have died\nNowadays what's been applied, in hip-hop is genocide\nThat's when the rappers go get the clappers\nCan't you see they trying to strap us just to trap us, good god it's backwards\nOne nation under a groove, that's how we move\nIt's time to teach the youth get it together show and prove\nMe no run with the gun or speak of none for action\nWhen you get done scream I'm the one, it looks like an illusion\nI deal with equality so never call my brethren son\nYes mon, me got mad flava just like jerk chicken"}}, {"title": "The Man/The Icon", "album": "Duck Season Vol. I", "year": "2002-01-01", "lyrics": "[Big Daddy

Pack in the place to be\nBetter known as the Chocolate City\nSo Scoob Lover, huh, are ya with me?\n\n[Verse One: Scoob Lover]\nYo, I break punks up like a fight. Give me the mic, I'm hype\n(Damn kid, you're starvin' for life)\nCause people be tellin' me, brothers be gellin' me\nTryin' to get fame from my name but they chumps and they Butt-soft\nThey know I'm wilder than a dog with hot sauce\nA mic, a stage, a crowd, and I won't stop:\nI set it off and get live like an alarm clock\nPeople thought Scoob and Scrap was just a nickname;\nNow that we rap, we sell more records than cocaine\nAwww, shucks, now I'm back from the down-low\nHere comes Scoob with the curly afro\nNo chemical reaction, no need for askin', pure satisfaction\nMy last name's Jackson\nYou slip up, I get ill -- my boot to your grill\nMy nine kills, I'm Big Scoob from Brownsville\nThe world's greatest lover, the chaaaaa-clate brother...\n\n[Chorus]\nWho's the committee? (CHOCOLATE CITY!) 3x\nScrap Lover are ya with me?\n\n[Verse Two: Scrap Lover]\nYo, I drop science kinda like a pigeon;\nOver rough tracks I tax any midget with a small digit\nSmooth and mild but complicated\nI put the crowd to to smashed like a driver that's intoxicated\nRappers write rhymes, and talk about guns and jail\nBut wouldn't squeeze a lemon in a cocktail\nDon't say \"huh?\" or \"what?\", and don't ask who\nCuz if you hear me, I must be talkin' to you\nYou probably thought I couldn't steal it, cuz I was a dancer\nI didn't have a chance, but ya'll can kill it\nYou gotta be off your rocker\nI'm lettin' suckers know that Scrap got more soul than Foot Locker\nAnd if you heard I got skills, believe it's true;\nSuggest for Pete Rock, for reminiscin' over you\nIt's not a threat, it's a bet, cuz hey\nThe last sucker who tried woulda been 25 today\n\n[Chorus]\nWho's the committee? (CHOCOLATE CITY!) 3x\nBig Daddy are ya with me?\n\n[Verse Three: Big Daddy Kane]\nYo-yo-yo-yo, look out, get out the way!\nHere comes the K the A the N the E -- huh, ya better flee\nCuz I don't need no hoodie to be hard, shoot:\nI'll kill a nigga in a three-piece suit\nI don't be havin' it so the rear I'll attack\nA size-15 to the buttocks, a-matter-fact\nA hard-core blow to the face I'll provide\nTo give you a Crooked eye, just like St. Ides\nLeave you home and you must be screamin' and yellin';\nNot even Kool Moe Dee shades can hide your swellin'\nI bring it rough, tough;\nI said that I was Browner than Bobby, so you know that it's good enough\nI'm untouchable to rappers my size\nYou dreamed of beatin' me, you better wake up and apologize\nSome claim to be a Daddy or Poppa\nBut with me, you'd have no Ranks if your name was Shabba\n\n[Chorus]\nWho's the committee? (CHOCOLATE CITY!) 3x\nNow you know you'd too like to be with it...\n\n[Verse Four: Li'l Daddy Shane]\nShane, I cause pain, I make it rain\nI'm wearin' and tearin' down to the last grain\nHa, I'm not a chocolate brother, but I dont' mourn\nCuz I swear this vanilla kid got it goin' on\nSo don't even step to me if you're worth nothin'\nBecause I just might hurt somethin'\nMy competition thinks twice, cuz yo, for a young nigga, I'm kinda nice...\n\n[Laree Williams, singing]\nOoooooooooooohhhh! Chocolate City are ya with meeeee?!\nScoob and Scrap and Mister Cee! Kane and Shane and Laaaarrrrreeeeeee!\nKaaaaaane....would your black ass sing it for mee-heee?!\n[Kane] Ohhh, ho, shit yeahhhh!

get wet (OW!)\n\n[Verse 1]\nI was the one to say I get the job done\nI did it and got with it, I must admit it was well fitted\nA piece of the pie would be fly\nInstead of a crumb for a bum, uh, I gotta get some\nBut I don't wanna be a secondhand, middle man\nI wanna take a grandstand and\nMakin' the cash flow grow\nPullin' myself outta the dirt\nAnd a job ain't nothin' but work\n\n[Hook 1 with various ad-libs]\nWORK!\nA job ain't nuthin' but work\nWORK! WORK!\nA job ain't nuthin' but work\nWORK! WORK!\n\n[Verse 2]\nMo' money, mo' money, mo' money\nGotta get made to get paid in this trade\nAnd I believe that I can achieve\nTo make ends meet like a hair weave\nSurvivin' in this economy, people in the world they gotta be\nStayin' in the upper class, so you're the path\nThe rich gets the most and the poor gets a little\nAnd only Monie Love can make it in the middle\nI can't let life get the best of me\nI gotta take, take control of my own destiny\nControl what I hold and of course be the boss of myself\nNo one else will bring me wealth\nI gotta hit them streets to make ends meet\nSo just bust the style of a hustler\nRun a scam, 'cause damn, many people pockets get hurt\nAnd a job ain't nuthin' but work\n\n[Hook 2 with various ad-libs]\nWorkin' everyday\nAll the damn week\nA job ain't nuthin' but work\nWorkin' everyday\nOn the subway\nA job ain't nothin' but work\nA job ain't nothin' but work\n\n[Bridge]\nNo more workin' overtime\nYou get yours and I'll get mine\nI won't stop at any cost\nI won't stop 'til I'm the boss\n\n[Hook 2 with various ad-libs]\nWorkin' everyday\nAll the damn week\nA job ain't nuthin' but work\nWorkin' everyday\nOn the subway\nA job ain't nothin' but work\nA job ain't nothin' but work\n\n[Verse 3]\nStraight outta the ghetto\nNot out of Beverly Hills or Flushing Meadows\nYet through, I made it this far and had to gamble, scramble, peddle\nAin't no shame in my game and I came through like a thoroughbred\nBut still there's more ahead\nI'm not the greedy, I'm the needy seekin' a financial status\nThat put my pockets to be the fattest\nI don't wanna be employed when times are hard\nI'm so against workin' I wouldn't even take a blowjob\nI'd rather do my own thing\nI gotta be the one in charge to make myself live large\nA J-O-B is not for me, I don't want no parts of it\nSo take this job and shove it\n\nWhen you work, sometimes you sweat\nAnd when you sweat you're gonna get wet"}}, {"title": "Somebody's Been Sleeping in my Bed", "album":

keep her\nCheatin' on me, what's the reason why?\nI hope you die\n\n[Hook]\nSomebody's been sleeping in my bed\nSomebody's been sleeping in my bed\n\n[Interlude]\nYou done hurt me, broke my heart\nAnd played me for your fool\nNow here's my chance to get back at you\nAnd I'm gonna blow my cool\n\n[Verse 3]\nAll day long\nI'm just singin' a somebody done somebody wrong song\nI'm tryin' to see how far can this kid go\nBefore our relationship ends up on skid row\nWhy should I try to stay attached to her\nWhen I'm probably better anywhere as a bachelor\nSo go 'head girl with that game you're talkin'\nAnd since you look like CeCe Peniston, \"Keep On Walkin'\"\nYour your your cheatin' heart, you're tryin' to rip mine apart\nUgh, I wish I'd seen it from the start\nCause now you're caught in what you thought was a fort\nTook a short, so I'll see you in court\n\n[Hook]\nSomebody's been sleeping in my bed\nSomebody's been sleeping in my bed\n\n[Robin Harris]\nI hate my wife\nI wear my

you might get that, you cheesy rat\nCause thinkin' about the cost of a divorce\nI feel like Johnnie Taylor, it's cheaper to keep her\nCheatin' on me, what's the reason why?\nI hope you die\n\n[Hook]\nSomebody's been sleeping in my bed\nSomebody's been sleeping in my bed\n\n[Interlude]\nYou done hurt me, broke my heart\nAnd played me for your fool\nNow here's my chance to get back at you\nAnd I'm gonna blow my cool\n\n[Verse 3]\nAll day long\nI'm just singin' a somebody done somebody wrong song\nI'm tryin' to see how far can this kid go\nBefore our relationship ends up on skid row\nWhy should I try to stay attached to her\nWhen I'm probably better anywhere as a bachelor\nSo go 'head girl with that game you're talkin'\nAnd since you look like CeCe Peniston, \"Keep On Walkin'\"\nYour your your cheatin' heart, you're tryin' to rip mine apart\nUgh, I wish I'd seen it from the start\nCause now you're caught in what you thought was a fort\nTook a short, so I'll see you in court\n\n[Hook]\nSomebody's been sleeping in my bed\nSomebody's been sleeping in my bed\n\n[Robin Harris]\nI hate my wife\nI wear my wedding ring on the finger\nCause I married the WRONG GOD DAMN woman\n\n[Richard Pryor]\nI leave homegirl ?\nAnd come back home, college feet be on"}}, {"title": "Here Comes Kane, Scoob and Scrap", "album": "Looks Like a Job For...", "year": "1993-05-25",

Jordan 3's\nNow you wanna talk legendary talk to me\nSome break records, so no one forget 'em\nBut we don't break records, we the ones to set 'em\nWhat's in a legend but cutting edges, perfection\nWith one obsession for staying on the top of his profession\nAnd if it ain't broke, we don't fix it\nAnd no remixes, no pre-fixes\nAnd if it ain't hot we ain't repping it\nYou ain't getting no half stepping\nHalf court lames that could never play a full\nAny little game just to see what they could call\nA wolf in sheep clothing gonna lie and say it's wool\nYou wanna be like Mike then save the bull\nMany try to stick 'em, many try to pick 'em\nAnd think slow, you made your D silent like Django\nA broken ankle, and now your tanks low\nOne octane, but homie, not Kane for short\nIt's evident I'm the rawest specimen\nWarlords and testaments to change your regimen\nSpitting to the beat or either the record spin\nYou wanna see the magic? All I need is just a pen\nSheer excellence, to say thus far\nYou can ask Isaac Newton how you greet a star\nYou asked for 16, I went way too far\nAnd I gave you 28, just to raise the bars"}}, {"title": "The Beef is On", "album": "Looks Like a Job For...", "year": "1993-05-25", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIt's hell up in Harlem. My main man just caught a bad one\nWetted by a magnum -- when he didn't have none\nThat goes to show you that even when you're respected\nBrothers'll still try ya if they think you're butt-naked\nSo, I went uptown to get the low-down\nTo see who made the whole thing go down\nWord on the streets had it\nSome kids from the Bronx with automatics\nCame to start static\nSome new jacks at the game\nTry'na to get a name\nHad a point to prove\nWrong move\nSo I can't wait to get em all straight\nIt's a big payback when I retaliate\n(Whoo) Steam, I gotta let it off\nAnd I can't wait to set it off\nTo avenge my main man that's gone\nAnd as sure as my name is Kane, word is bond\nThe beef is on\n\n[Chorus]\n(Once again it's on)\n[(You got beef)] x 3\n(...you better save it for the muthafuckin meat market) )) x 2\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt's time to show them how to get hard\nCallin a hit squad and pull all these clown's ciddard\nFor tryin to friddont and fiddake the middood\nBut when I get riddude - awesome dude\nSo I took a little trip to Brooklyn\nBedstuy Do-Or-Die is where i was lookin\nFor my boys from Roosevelt, Albany and Marcy\nPlus I got a posse over in Canarsie\nI'm talkin about ill brothers that don't play\nThey sit around watchin 'Scarface' all day\nSo here we go, headed up to they scene\nTwenty deep in a van like the A-Team\nWe rolled up to see what this joint's about\nWhen one of my boys in the van just pointed em out\nSo without delay we reacted\nAnd started shootin like it was target practice\nWhen they saw that we wasn't messin around\nOne tried to run, so I had to chase him down\nI caught the kid by the corner store deli\nKicked him in the belly like I was Jim Kelly\nI did his jugular vein something violent\nCame back to see my crew made the rest silent\nWe sent fifteen bodies to Trapper John\nCos the beef was on\n\n(You send your boys in I send em back in a paperbag)\n\n[Verse 3]\nMany screamed about a homicide\nBut when I came to shut em down all the drama died\nI plead insanity when I got a jam with me\nAnd we roll like the Corleone family\nI bring the boys that'll bring the noise\nIn the aftermath everything's destroyed\nLike a crew of barbarians\nAnd brothers that want beef, I make em vegetarians\nSo don't even front and try to put it as if you're ruff\nCos soon as I see ya, best believe i'ma call your bluff\nAnd everyone else that tried to press up on me tuff\nHave fallen and they can't get up\nMy game is a ill one\nCos i'm a real one\nLorda mercy\nNuff controversy\nA gangster, a con\nA pimp and a don\nWaitin for the beef to be

My main man just caught a bad one\nWetted by a magnum -- when he didn't have none\nThat goes to show you that even when you're respected\nBrothers'll still try ya if they think you're butt-naked\nSo, I went uptown to get the low-down\nTo see who made the whole thing go down\nWord on the streets had it\nSome kids from the Bronx with automatics\nCame to start static\nSome new jacks at the game\nTry'na to get a name\nHad a point to prove\nWrong move\nSo I can't wait to get em all straight\nIt's a big payback when I retaliate\n(Whoo) Steam, I gotta let it off\nAnd I can't wait to set it off\nTo avenge my main man that's gone\nAnd as sure as my name is Kane, word is bond\nThe beef is on\n\n[Chorus]\n(Once again it's on)\n[(You got beef)] x 3\n(...you better save it for the muthafuckin meat market) )) x 2\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt's time to show them how to get hard\nCallin a hit squad and pull all these clown's ciddard\nFor tryin to friddont and fiddake the middood\nBut when I get riddude - awesome dude\nSo I took a little trip to Brooklyn\nBedstuy Do-Or-Die is where i was lookin\nFor my boys from Roosevelt, Albany and Marcy\nPlus I got a posse over in Canarsie\nI'm talkin about ill brothers that don't play\nThey sit around watchin 'Scarface' all day\nSo here we go, headed up to they scene\nTwenty deep in a van like the A-Team\nWe rolled up to see what this joint's about\nWhen one of my boys in the van just pointed em out\nSo without delay we reacted\nAnd started shootin like it was target practice\nWhen they saw that we wasn't messin around\nOne tried to run, so I had to chase him down\nI caught the kid by the corner store deli\nKicked him in the belly like I was Jim Kelly\nI did his jugular vein something violent\nCame back to see my crew made the rest silent\nWe sent fifteen bodies to Trapper John\nCos the beef was on\n\n(You send your boys in I send em back in a paperbag)\n\n[Verse 3]\nMany screamed about a homicide\nBut when I came to shut em down all the drama died\nI plead insanity when I got a jam with me\nAnd we roll like the Corleone family\nI bring the boys that'll bring the noise\nIn the aftermath everything's destroyed\nLike a crew of barbarians\nAnd brothers that want beef, I make em vegetarians\nSo don't even front and try to put it as if you're ruff\nCos soon as I see ya, best believe i'ma call your bluff\nAnd everyone else that tried to press up on me tuff\nHave fallen and they can't get up\nMy game is a ill one\nCos i'm a real one\nLorda mercy\nNuff controversy\nA gangster, a con\nA pimp and a don\nWaitin for the beef to be on"}}, {"title": "Niggaz Never Learn", "album": "Looks Like a Job For...", "year": "1993-05-25", "lyrics": "[Produced by Large Professor]\n\nThings been said, plenty rumors been spread\nMany many many new jacks got it in they head\nThat they can raise up on this and put the Kane in fright\nHe-he, Yeah right!\nListen, you're just as soft as baby powder\nDon't let your mouth get you in somethin'\nYour rhymes can't get you out of\nSome good advice is don't even come out my way\nYou better press upon Chucky if you're lookin' for Child's Play\n'Cause I'm a grown ass man in total command\nOne of the best to ever be and\nNo other can ever take a stand\nWhen I kick a verse, the scene becomes so scary\nThat niggas get quiet like a library\nI pick up the mic like a hunter in hot pursuit\nOh, you want some of this?

to\nPhony emcees, I move on and seize\nI just conquer and stomp another rapper with ease\nCause I'm at my apex and others are below\nNothing but a milliliter, I'm a kilo\nSecond to none, making emcees run\nSo don't try to step to me, cause I ain't the one\nI relieve rappers, just like Tylenol\nAnd they know it, so I don't see why you all\nTry to front, perpetratin' a stunt\nWhen you know that I'll smoke you up like a blunt\nI'm genuine like Gucci, raw like sushi\nTo stage a rage is what rap did to me\nTo make me want to create, chaos and mayhem\nCold rock a party, until the A.M\nI'll make a muscle, grab the mic and hustle\nWhile you stand dazed and amazed, I bust a\nLittle rhyme with authority, superiority\nAnd captivate the whole crowd's majority\nThe rhymes I use definitely amuse\nBetter than Dynasty, or Hill Street Blues\nI'm sure to score adored for more without a flaw\nCause I get raw\n\n[Hook]\n\"R-A-W\"\n\"R-A-W\"\n\"R-A-W\"\n\"R-A-W\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nAttack, react, exact, the mack'll move you with\nA strong song as long as you groove to this\nI keep the crowd loud when you're hyped\nDo damage on stage and injure the mic\nAs I shoot the gift, emcees stand stiff\nWhile my rhymes stick to you like Skippy and Jif\nFeel my blunt fist, or my death kiss\nThe rap soloist - you don't want none of this\nSupreme in this era, I reign with terror\nWhen I grab the mic, believe you're gonna hear a\nFascinating rhyme, as I enchant them\nSo let's all sing the Big Daddy anthem\nGo with the flow, my rhymes grow like an afro\nAn entertaining gain, the Kane'll never no\nProblem, I could sneeze sniffle or cough\nEeee-even if I stutter I'ma still come off\nCause rappers can't understand the mics I rip\nThey sho' nuff ain't equipped, that's why they got flipped\nBut

comin'\"\n\"I'm comin'\"\n\n[Verse 1]\nHere I am, R-A-W\nA terrorist, here to bring trouble to\nPhony emcees, I move on and seize\nI just conquer and stomp another rapper with ease\nCause I'm at my apex and others are below\nNothing but a milliliter, I'm a kilo\nSecond to none, making emcees run\nSo don't try to step to me, cause I ain't the one\nI relieve rappers, just like Tylenol\nAnd they know it, so I don't see why you all\nTry to front, perpetratin' a stunt\nWhen you know that I'll smoke you up like a blunt\nI'm genuine like Gucci, raw like sushi\nTo stage a rage is what rap did to me\nTo make me want to create, chaos and mayhem\nCold rock a party, until the A.M\nI'll make a muscle, grab the mic and hustle\nWhile you stand dazed and amazed, I bust a\nLittle rhyme with authority, superiority\nAnd captivate the whole crowd's majority\nThe rhymes I use definitely amuse\nBetter than Dynasty, or Hill Street Blues\nI'm sure to score adored for more without a flaw\nCause I get raw\n\n[Hook]\n\"R-A-W\"\n\"R-A-W\"\n\"R-A-W\"\n\"R-A-W\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nAttack, react, exact, the mack'll move you with\nA strong song as long as you groove to this\nI keep the crowd loud when you're hyped\nDo damage on stage and injure the mic\nAs I shoot the gift, emcees stand stiff\nWhile my rhymes stick to you like Skippy and Jif\nFeel my blunt fist, or my death kiss\nThe rap soloist - you don't want none of this\nSupreme in this era, I reign with terror\nWhen I grab the mic, believe you're gonna hear a\nFascinating rhyme, as I enchant them\nSo let's all sing the Big Daddy anthem\nGo with the flow, my rhymes grow like an afro\nAn entertaining gain, the Kane'll never no\nProblem, I could sneeze sniffle or cough\nEeee-even if I stutter I'ma still come off\nCause rappers can't understand the mics I rip\nThey sho' nuff ain't equipped, that's why they got flipped\nBut my apparatus is up to status\nDon't ask who the baddest, or cause static\nTo make or break or take em, my rhymes hit the head\nPut it to bed, so watch what's said\nSave the bass for the piper, rearrange your tone\nTake a loss and be forced from the danger zone\nI get ill and kill at will\nTeachin' a skill that's real, yeah, no frill\nJust stand still and chill as I build\nScience I drill until my rhymes fill your head up\n\"R-A-W\" - don't even get up\nCompetition shut up, cause I'm raw\n\n[Hook]\n\"Hit me!\"\n\"Hit me!\"\n\"Hit me!\"\n\"Hit me!\"\n\"Hit me!\"\n\"Hit me!\"\n\"Hit me!\"\n\"Hit me!\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe man at hand to rule and school to teach and reach\nThe blind to find their way from A to Z\nAnd be the most and boast the loudest rap again\nTo reign your domain (Yeah, Kane!)\nThe heat is on, so feel the fire\nCome off the empire, all the more higher\nLevel of depth, one step beyond dope\nThe suckers all scope and hope to cope but nope\nCause I never let em on top of me\nI play em out like a game of Monopoly\nLet em speed around the board like an astro\nThen send em to jail for tryin to pass Go\nShakin em up, breakin em up, takin no stuff\nBut it still ain't loud enough\nSo let the volume increase, never to cease\nI'ma release a masterpiece a slip of the tongue like grease\nRippin' the mic to shreds, puttin' heads to bed\nCode red cause the rhymes is bein' said\nBy the Asiatic printer of raw poetry\nNo hints or clues, you all know it's me\nI go pound for pound and round for round to clown the sound\nProfound it's bound to go down, ugh\nA lyrical knockout, showin' I got clout\nMy comp should just drop out\nCause none of them can see me\nI leave em whinin' like their name was BeBe or CeCe\nI get raw"}}, {"title": "2 Da Good Tymz", "album": "Veteranz Day", "year": null, "lyrics": "Times was simply plain I knew they'd eventually change\nLet's take a trip down memory lane\nWith the game talker, native new yorker\nGators on my feet, formerly british walker\nYes love, that's how it was before\nWhen you was funky fresh or down by law\nParlay with your crew at the corner store\nCarrying a boom box 'til your arms were sore\nWe be wildin' on the corner free stylin'\nOr politickin' 'bout doe we see pilin'\nOr either girls we be getting with, how we be hitting it\nLying bout skins that we didn't get\nSlow moving at paces through the rat races\nThe jordache look and fat laces\nMaking moves any type of way\nI remember it like yesterday, hey\n\nChorus\nHere's to you\nThat's how it was before\nWhen you was funky fresh or down by law\nWay back in the days how we used to do\nThank you for the good times y'all\nRepeat\n\nVerse 2\nD\u00e9ja vu, things ain't nothing new\nShorties make me think how we used to do\nWhen you couldn't be sleeping, if you plan on keeping\nHold of your sheepskin, heads do be peeping\nThink it can't happen to you, now could it?\nCame to school wearing Puma's went home barefooted\nAnd on the weekends when everybody click\nTo slide to the deuce to check karate flicks\nCome back around the way after dark\nSo the crew could embark on the jam in the park\nWhat would happen that night, was to scrap in a fight\nOnly way to break it up was playing Rappers Delight\nAnd as I sit back watching you\nShorties out there doing what you got to do\nI feel for you being sincere\nCause where you trying to go I already been there, yeah\n\nChorus\n\nVerse 3\nAin't nothing but love I got to give\nI don't playa hate cause we all got to live\nThat negative lifestyle I prohibit\nGood life I got to live it, bubbly I got to sip it\nNow I'll admit that I sort of be flashing\nBut yet and still I do it in an orderly fashion\nBring on the honeys and watch me mack these, stack cheese\nGo on with your bad self, black caes\nJust when the game got the stakes set high\nStraight from bed stuy, the return of the jedi\nWith a jewel cause I'm tired of seeing\nCharges being brought up, on brothers getting caught up\nNow it's about time we connect, organize and collect\nA new wold order's in effect\nI send this out to the shorties in the hood\nI wanna see you all live good", "image": "https://images.genius.com/55a075f6632f5b5a223681bd3f7a7ca8.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Big Daddy Kane", "raw":

on my feet, formerly british walker\nYes love, that's how it was before\nWhen you was funky fresh or down by law\nParlay with your crew at the corner store\nCarrying a boom box 'til your arms were sore\nWe be wildin' on the corner free stylin'\nOr politickin' 'bout doe we see pilin'\nOr either girls we be getting with, how we be hitting it\nLying bout skins that we didn't get\nSlow moving at paces through the rat races\nThe jordache look and fat laces\nMaking moves any type of way\nI remember it like yesterday, hey\n\nChorus\nHere's to you\nThat's how it was before\nWhen you was funky fresh or down by law\nWay back in the days how we used to do\nThank you for the good times y'all\nRepeat\n\nVerse 2\nD\u00e9ja vu, things ain't nothing new\nShorties make me think how we used to do\nWhen you couldn't be sleeping, if you plan on keeping\nHold of your sheepskin, heads do be peeping\nThink it can't happen to you, now could it?\nCame to school wearing Puma's went home barefooted\nAnd on the weekends when everybody click\nTo slide to the deuce to check karate flicks\nCome back around the way after dark\nSo the crew could embark on the jam in the park\nWhat would happen that night, was to scrap in a fight\nOnly way to break it up was playing Rappers Delight\nAnd as I sit back watching you\nShorties out there doing what you got to do\nI feel for you being sincere\nCause where you trying to go I already been there, yeah\n\nChorus\n\nVerse 3\nAin't nothing but love I got to give\nI don't playa hate cause we all got to live\nThat negative lifestyle I prohibit\nGood life I got to live it, bubbly I got to sip it\nNow I'll admit that I sort of be flashing\nBut yet and still I do it in an orderly fashion\nBring on the honeys and watch me mack these, stack cheese\nGo on with your bad self, black caes\nJust when the game got the stakes set high\nStraight from bed stuy, the return of the jedi\nWith a jewel cause I'm tired of seeing\nCharges being brought up, on brothers getting caught up\nNow it's about time we connect, organize and collect\nA new wold order's in effect\nI send this out to the shorties in the hood\nI wanna see you all live good"}}, {"title": "Definitely", "album": "Veteranz Day", "year": "1998-04-28", "lyrics": "In this corner, representin' BK, NY\nWho, come again , I\nThat you can't deny\nFor the while I stayed, laid

through\nBaby, you can count on me, a sure thing\nI be all inside your hood, just like a drawstring\nThe wack, I restrict 'em, rhymes I kick 'em\nGirls I just stick 'em, whose my next victim?\nThinkin' you was ballin', now I'm callin\n\nYo' bluff(Uh huh), sho nuff (Well alright)\nWho you came out to see in the place to be\nThe ebony black ice, who that be?\n(Yours

"[Verse 1]\nSomebody tell me who's that, what's that\nIt's the man with the silk drawers stuck up his buttcrack\nDon't even front and try to ask who is this\nCause my name rings more bells than a Jehovah Witness\nStronger than Listerine, moppin up rappers like Mr. Clean\nOh Lord, the Kane just hit the scene\nBooyaka bo buck, rappers have no luck\nCause when I come through, I'm catchin wreck, like a tow truck\nCause ain't no way in the world the Kane could ever, fade\nI'm stayin on top of this thing, in order for me to get, paid\nAnd anyone comin to me for a battle is gettin, slayed\nWhenever it comes to the lyrics I'm rappin I got it, made\nSo back up off me, cause yo' rap\nHave no hap' so slow dat and act like you know dat\nCause you can dream about bein this up to par\nBut not even Johnny Mathis can tell you what your chances are\nCompetition I'll drill em, and definitely outskill em\nTo make the long story short, I kill em\nCause I face em like Jason, bizarre\nAnd when I come through, it's like tchk tchk ahh\n\n[Chorus]\nCome on, heidi heidi heidi ho\nAnd yo I got the funky flow\nSo let yourself go!\nHeidi heidi heidi ho\nAnd yo I got the funky flow\nSo let yourself go!\nCome on, heidi heidi heidi ho\nAnd yo I got the funky flow\nSo let yourself go!\nCome on, heidi heidi heidi ho\nAnd yo I got the funky flow\nSo let yourself go!\n\n[Verse 2]\nGivin you mo', ready to go, kickin the flow, rippin the show\nComin to blow, check out a pro, look at the glow, act like you know\nLeft the lonely lonely through lyrics loose in me\nLeave the lowlife left lingerin lost like ???\nAnything you can imagine done to a microphone I did it\nRipped it, flipped it, hit it, split it, let it so dig it\nBut don't make me get ill, or chill, cause if I exercise my skill\nRappers'll hit the floor like Johnny Gill\nThe smoothest soloist, with this to exist to bliss\nAnd diss who risk to test this\nCause this ain't no game, I treat you like\nA picture of my ex-girl, and rip that ass out the frame\nI come pursuant, pursuant, pursuant, pursuant\nAnd step it to him, to him, to him, to him, to him\nI leave a rapper's career ruined, ruined, ruined, ruined\nAnd watch him fade like my voice is doin, doin, doin\nEase back when I attack\nYour poetry is wack so don't ask for no slack\nCause I'm tell you straight up, I'mma bring it son\nYou want +Poetic Justice+ go see John Singleton\nBecause a battle ain't no thing to me\nAnd I don't look nothin like Tarzan\nSo don't think you can swing with me\nJust let the Kane take control, I'd like to know\nIf you really ready for some super dynamite soul!\n\n[Chorus]\nThen come on, heidi heidi heidi ho\nAnd yo I got the funky flow\nSo let yourself go!\nUh-huh, heidi heidi heidi ho\nAnd yo I got the funky flow\nSo let yourself go!\nUh-huh, heidi heidi heidi ho\nAnd yo I got the funky flow\nSo let yourself go!\nCome on, heidi heidi heidi ho\nAnd yo I got the funky flow\nSo let yourself go!\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo what's this? A new attitude, you're tryin to act rude\nYou saw _Menace_ and now you in a gangsta mood\nWhat are you kiddin me? That's the heart of stupidity\nIf you wanna be a gangsta, join the mafia in Italy\nFakin and frontin on stage like you're hard\nI hope when you get to Detroit, the real thugs gon' pull your card\nFlashin guns like you got somethin to prove G\nWhat, you wanna be in the next John Singleton movie?\nYou're sayin that you're buckwhylin\nBut don't convince me, convince the brothers on the Island\nOtherwise just forget it, unless niggas that did ten years\nSay you a gangsta, I ain't wit it\n\"Yo, I raped his mother, yo, I shot and killed him\"\nIs that what you wanna get across to the children?\nI guess you're not gonna be happy til it's for real\nFour year old kids, doin drivebys on Big Wheels\nOr maybe you wanna see it be more fatal\nLike Kindergarten kids, tryin to cook crack with Play-Doh\nNow I don't mean to take the fun out the jam\nI just want some to understand about the gun in the hand\nWe gotta show our people how to live equal\nPeace out, I'm catchin folks on the sequel\n\n[Chorus]\nIt go, heidi heidi heidi ho\nAnd yo I got the funky flow\nSo let yourself go!\nUh-huh, heidi heidi heidi ho\nAnd yo I got the funky flow\nSo let yourself go!\nCome on, heidi heidi heidi ho\nAnd yo I got the funky flow\nSo let yourself go!\nCome on, heidi heidi heidi ho\nAnd yo I got the funky flow\nSo let yourself go!"}}, {"title": "Shame!", "album": "Veteranz Day", "year": "1998-04-28", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThere's no myth or fable about the pimpin' at your label\nWhat goes on under the table, why you think your deal is so unstable?\nNow, whose the macaroni, A&R's acting phony\nOnce you make the matrimony, then he start to slackin' don't he\nOr could it be the president that's being hesitant\nPlayin' his artist like a corner workin' specimen\nAnd I ain't kidding you when I say it's political\nThe way they make a ridicule of artists can be pitiful\nYou know damn well there shouldn't be no company CO\nTrying to show me about rap that's 53 or so\nBut yet and still they want to add advice, trying to keep their status right\nWhen they should be working records for Gladys Knight\nWho shape artists, man they catching rape charges\nOnce you sign on the dotted line, they lead you in the blind\nThen you find, your state of revenue remains the same\nCause you getting less points than Steve Kerr be getting in a game\nAnd just because it be too hardcore to judge it\nThey won't even touch it, and get to frontin' on the budget\nWhen new artists come out, I can foresee the worst outcome\nCause everybody I know got beat their first album\nSo I took my contract to a lawyer so he can check it out (He don't know)\nThen I took it to Dionne Warwick so she can  read my hand (She don't know)\n\nChorus\nIt's a shame, when artists gotta deal with cheats\nThey got game, for every young rapper they see out on the streets\nYou sign your name, they get like Big Red on the Five Heartbeats\nNow who the blame, when you starvin' and your record label eats\n\n[Verse 2]\nPreach brother\nThey say the truth will set you free, but I see signs of treachery\nGo on perpetually, here's how they get you G\nThey use the tricks, just to juice your mix\nBut cross be in their heart like a vampire stabbed with a crucifix\nI had the enemy in my vicinity with the false identity\nOf a friend to me to injure me\nThey ride along just to guide you wrong\nPlay like they beside you strong, and start to faking moves like Olajuwon\nWho side you on, revealing all that low down dirty dealing\nI can see your skin peeling it changed like a chameleon\nFirst you believe in them, but once you disagree with them\nThey try to get Magilla repertoire and that ain't even them\nAnd all those who has betrayed, be fast to fade\nCause they cast a shade, with the masquerade\nWhat's dealt, is low blows below the belt\nLord have mercy, I know how Julius Caesar must have felt\nI start to think back when I was just a youth\nI should have listened to the words of the God Born Truth\nHe said, \"look out for black snakes they all up in your cypher\nBlack snakes you can't see therefore they sneak up and they bite ya'\"\nThey get to flippin' cause they think you slippin'\nSo remember, don't get to slippin' cause they get to flippin'\nAnd trippin', what's that you grippin', beside your hippin'\nYou think my heart is skippin', go save that game for Scottie Pippen\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's a shame, to see how far left people be going\nThey got game, to think that all this time you said you know them\nIt ain't the same, Aah, so now you see the way they flowin'\nNow who they blame, ain't nothing but a wolf in sheep's clothing\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow, wait a minute, I'm starting to see lotsa, hip-hop imposters\nIs rap a category at the Oscars?\nToo much Nino Brown up in your life\nCause since then, man I done seen Wesley Snipes playin' a drag queen\nBut yet and still you want to mimic the stars of cinema\nPretending huh? So full of it they need an enema\nCause see dig, they all like to talk big\nBut then they want to renege, when there's a curling iron in their wig\nYou talking loud and saying nothing, what's the world becoming?\nThe frontin', now pay attention you may learn something\nNow, I ain't knocking you, but come on let's be logical\nYou know that it's impossible to stop the unstoppable\nI would suggest that they, go back and check my resume\nCause tunes that I made yesterday, can hang out with the best today\nPeace to Easy Mo, cause he makes the beats to flow\nAnd I grab the microphone and

phony\nOnce you make the matrimony, then he start to slackin' don't he\nOr could it be the president that's being hesitant\nPlayin' his artist like a corner workin' specimen\nAnd I ain't kidding you when I say it's political\nThe way they make a ridicule of artists can be pitiful\nYou know damn well there shouldn't be no company CO\nTrying to show me about rap that's 53 or so\nBut yet and still they want to add advice, trying to keep their status right\nWhen they should be working records for Gladys Knight\nWho shape artists, man they catching rape charges\nOnce you sign on the dotted line, they lead you in the blind\nThen you find, your state of revenue remains the same\nCause you getting less points than Steve Kerr be getting in a game\nAnd just because it be too hardcore to judge it\nThey won't even touch it, and get to frontin' on the budget\nWhen new artists come out, I can foresee the worst outcome\nCause everybody I know got beat their first album\nSo I took my contract to a lawyer so he can check it out (He don't know)\nThen I took it to Dionne Warwick so she can  read my hand (She don't know)\n\nChorus\nIt's a shame, when artists gotta deal with cheats\nThey got game, for every young rapper they see out on the streets\nYou sign your name, they get like Big Red on the Five Heartbeats\nNow who the blame, when you starvin' and your record label eats\n\n[Verse 2]\nPreach brother\nThey say the truth will set you free, but I see signs of treachery\nGo on perpetually, here's how they get you G\nThey use the tricks, just to juice your mix\nBut cross be in their heart like a vampire stabbed with a crucifix\nI had the enemy in my vicinity with the false identity\nOf a friend to me to injure me\nThey ride along just to guide you wrong\nPlay like they beside you strong, and start to faking moves like Olajuwon\nWho side you on, revealing all that low down dirty dealing\nI can see your skin peeling it changed like a chameleon\nFirst you believe in them, but once you disagree with them\nThey try to get Magilla repertoire and that ain't even them\nAnd all those who has betrayed, be fast to fade\nCause they cast a shade, with the masquerade\nWhat's dealt, is low blows below the belt\nLord have mercy, I know how Julius Caesar must have felt\nI start to think back when I was just a youth\nI should have listened to the words of the God Born Truth\nHe said, \"look out for black snakes they all up in your cypher\nBlack snakes you can't see therefore they sneak up and they bite ya'\"\nThey get to flippin' cause they think you slippin'\nSo remember, don't get to slippin' cause they get to flippin'\nAnd trippin', what's that you grippin', beside your hippin'\nYou think my heart is skippin', go save that game for Scottie Pippen\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's a shame, to see how far left people be going\nThey got game, to think that all this time you said you know them\nIt ain't the same, Aah, so now you see the way they flowin'\nNow who they blame, ain't nothing but a wolf in sheep's clothing\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow, wait a minute, I'm starting to see lotsa, hip-hop imposters\nIs rap a category at the Oscars?\nToo much Nino Brown up in your life\nCause since then, man I done seen Wesley Snipes playin' a drag queen\nBut yet and still you want to mimic the stars of cinema\nPretending huh? So full of it they need an enema\nCause see dig, they all like to talk big\nBut then they want to renege, when there's a curling iron in their wig\nYou talking loud and saying nothing, what's the world becoming?\nThe frontin', now pay attention you may learn something\nNow, I ain't knocking you, but come on let's be logical\nYou know that it's impossible to stop the unstoppable\nI would suggest that they, go back and check my resume\nCause tunes that I made yesterday, can hang out with the best today\nPeace to Easy Mo, cause he makes the beats to flow\nAnd I grab the microphone and flip it like pizza dough\n\n[Chorus]\nShame\nNow who the blame\nI need to be the Mayor, so I can change the things around here\nI need to be the Governor, I need to be the Governor"}}, {"title": "Mr. Pitiful", "album": "Taste of Chocolate", "year": "1990-10-30", "lyrics": "[Production by Cool V]\n\nIntro: Mmm.. mmm, yeah\nOh I like this\nI wanna tell this story\nA little story about umm..\n.. a brother who you would think has everything goin for himself\nBut apparently for some reason he just ain't happenin\nI call this brother Mr. Pitiful\nI wanna tell you somethin about him, check it out\n\n[Verse 1: Big Daddy Kane]\nThe story begins in 1984\nWhen I met the Biz Markie out in front of the store\nHe used to tell me all the time, \"Yo your lyrics is hype\nWe got to get together and make a record of some type\"\nI said, \"Man, the hype behind Run-D.M.C. and Cool J\nWhat the fuck makes you think they're gonna give us a play?\"\nWe did a few shows together, freestylin on stage\nManhattan and Long Island, for Mike and Dave\nAfter that, I was convinced we can do it\nUntil my man Biz jetted and came out with \"Make the Music..\"\nFrom right there, I said, \"Man, this shit is real\nLook at Biz in the new leather and a pair of spot bills\"\nI got to give it to you Dukes, I was wrong\nWell you out there now, so put my black ass on\nAnd sure enough, huh, in about a year's time\nI was R-A-W, goin for mine\nDroppin jams that slammed on every radio program\nAnd bam, GOD DAMN, look where I am\nThe first album, _Long Live the Kane_, it sold\nAbout umm.. AWW FUKKIT it went gold\nThe money was comin in, yes I had done em in\nIt wasn't quite hard for me to find a woman then\nCause I was in demand for lots of fans\nA sexy chocolate guy in the public eye\nI bought myself a condo out in Queens\nA plush white Volvo and drove off the scene\nBut I remained the same since I moved out\nFor instance - drinkin Olde E and Guinness Stout\nAnd also, hangin out with the troops\nMost of all, takin care of Ma Dukes\nThen all of a sudden things started to change\nAnd many old friends started actin strange\nBehind my back, sayin I'm soft and a sucker\nSome even said, \"Yo let's rob the motherfucker\"\nAnd family members askin for my papers\nBut Biz set them straight, by makin \"The Vapors\"\nGirls cryin pregnant, to get some of my green\nI'm like, \"What the fuck is this? Billie Jean?\"\nPeople harassin me, steadily askin me\nDis or dat, some even had the audacity\nTo say that I only liked light-skinned women\nTchk, huh, are you kiddin?\nCause I love everyone\nAnd I never act prejudiced to none\nBut for some reason people make my lifestyle so critical\nThat's why they call me Mr. Pitiful\n\nOutro: A few people know what I'm sayin\nHmm, to the Little Daddy Shane, you know what I mean\nAnd to my man Cool V, you know what I mean\nTo T.J. Swan, you know what I mean\nAnd to Scoob and Scrap, you know what I mean\nTo Rob Base and E.Z.

AWW FUKKIT it went gold\nThe money was comin in, yes I had done em in\nIt wasn't quite hard for me to find a woman then\nCause I was in demand for lots of fans\nA sexy chocolate guy in the public eye\nI bought myself a condo out in Queens\nA plush white Volvo and drove off the scene\nBut I remained the same since I moved out\nFor instance - drinkin Olde E and Guinness Stout\nAnd also, hangin out with the troops\nMost of all, takin care of Ma Dukes\nThen all of a sudden things started to change\nAnd many old friends started actin strange\nBehind my back, sayin I'm soft and a sucker\nSome even said, \"Yo let's rob the motherfucker\"\nAnd family members askin for my papers\nBut Biz set them straight, by makin \"The Vapors\"\nGirls cryin pregnant, to get some of my green\nI'm like, \"What the fuck is this? Billie Jean?\"\nPeople harassin me, steadily askin me\nDis or dat, some even had the audacity\nTo say that I only liked light-skinned women\nTchk, huh, are you kiddin?\nCause I love everyone\nAnd I never act prejudiced to none\nBut for some reason people make my lifestyle so critical\nThat's why they call me Mr. Pitiful\n\nOutro: A few people know what I'm sayin\nHmm, to the Little Daddy Shane, you know what I mean\nAnd to my man Cool V, you know what I mean\nTo T.J.

little food for thought\nAs I tell it, cause if it happened to this cat\nThen it can happen to you\nDo the knowledge\n\n[Verse 1]\nI was sittin' outside double parked after dark\nI think it was the corner of Nostrand and St. Mark\nThat's when this stray cat walked up to me\nNow I was sure he would be\nBut you woulda thought he'd know me\nTellin' his life story to me\nHe said 'Yo Kane', since way back in his life\nDays of Rappers Delight, yo he was after the hype\nHe rocked the Kangols, Adidas when Run and them had that spot\nWhen I came out, he had a flat-top\nAnd when Naughty came out, a couple years ago\nHe even tried the braids up in his hair, but they ain't hear him tho\nVexed and down, you know next he found\nHeavy D was blowing up, so then he tried to gain extra pounds\nNo thanks to that, they ranked him wack\nOnly thing that's left to do, was to go gangsta rap\nSo now he rhyme about the keys being sold\nThe G's being fold, the trees being rolled\nNow sure he should, he started acting like he from the hood\nTalking thug game and had his record sales doing good\nAnd so now, you on the road to riches\nReferring to the womankind as hoes and bitches\nYeah, you the man now because you rap different\nBut you got your 7 year old daughter listenin'\nThe twist begin\nWhen that the image you projecting\nIt starts to reflecting on your shorty cause she checking\n\n[Chorus X2]\nDo you really know\nWhat's the path that you really need to go\nAnd what example you really need to show\nThe good rep or the hood rep\nWhile she's walking in her father's footsteps\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt be that excess drama, wonder rhymer\nThat could make one rapper, convert to, gun clapper\nThat acting buckwild, boy you know that ain't your style\nPlus your thug profile is now reflecting on your child\nYou thinking that it couldn't happen\nBut then it happen\nAnd now you're rappin, came back to haunt you\nBecause you want to\nBe in her face puffin' li with your crew\nYou even let her take a sip or two upon your brew\nInstead of tryin to shed light, to keep her head right\nSo that she wouldn't do the things that the next kid might\nOh now you never did consider tho\nYour kid could go\nTrying to do the things she saw you do up in your video\nYou went upstairs thinking that she wasn't able\nSlipping, left your Glock sittin' pon the coffee table\nSo as you hang, with your gang, doin your thang\nBLOWE! unexpectedly to your ears the shot rang\nCame down, never thinking that you'd see what you saw\nRight there, layin in blood across your livin room floor\nSo now, as you sit in grief, total disbelief\nCause everything that ever mattered\nTo you is all shattered\nInstead of concentratin' heavily on what your rep be\nYou should have been thankful for your child like Cheryl Pepsi\nCause if you would have stayed aware\nTo whose in your care\nShe wouldn't be no casualty to your career\"\n\n[Chorus X2]\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhere did they find you?\nYou came into this game and let this new trend blind ya\nA&R's was wrong to sign ya\nYou gotta be true to this game to stay in the art\nBut guys like you get bent apart\nBecause you ain't got it in the heart\nRepresenting who? you better not be getting new\nHow you gonna be guerilla when you never been up in the zoo\nYour whole persona's theatrical\nAin't nothing bout you natural\nHere, show me now, how many gats you pull\nCause when you talk that talk\nYou gotta walk that walk\nOr leave it up to the real OG's up North\nCause those who dramatize, realize, and be advised\nYou couldn't handle 3 to 5\nCause many seeking fortune and fame\nGot caught in the game\nThinking the thug status was supporting the claim\nAll you gangsta acts y'all be guerillas on tracks\nBut relax, cause this is just wax\nTell em again\nYou gangsta acts be guerillas on tracks\nBut relax, cause this is just wax\nOne more time\nY'all gangsta acts y'all be guerillas on tracks\nBut relax, this just wax, nigga, damn\n\n[Chorus

double parked after dark\nI think it was the corner of Nostrand and St. Mark\nThat's when this stray cat walked up to me\nNow I was sure he would be\nBut you woulda thought he'd know me\nTellin' his life story to me\nHe said 'Yo Kane', since way back in his life\nDays of Rappers Delight, yo he was after the hype\nHe rocked the Kangols, Adidas when Run and them had that spot\nWhen I came out, he had a flat-top\nAnd when Naughty came out, a couple years ago\nHe even tried the braids up in his hair, but they ain't hear him tho\nVexed and down, you know next he found\nHeavy D was blowing up, so then he tried to gain extra pounds\nNo thanks to that, they ranked him wack\nOnly thing that's left to do, was to go gangsta rap\nSo now he rhyme about the keys being sold\nThe G's being fold, the trees being rolled\nNow sure he should, he started acting like he from the hood\nTalking thug game and had his record sales doing good\nAnd so now, you on the road to riches\nReferring to the womankind as hoes and bitches\nYeah, you the man now because you rap different\nBut you got your 7 year old daughter listenin'\nThe twist begin\nWhen that the image you projecting\nIt starts to reflecting on your shorty cause she checking\n\n[Chorus X2]\nDo you really know\nWhat's the path that you really need to go\nAnd what example you really need to show\nThe good rep or the hood rep\nWhile she's walking in her father's footsteps\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt be that excess drama, wonder rhymer\nThat could make one rapper, convert to, gun clapper\nThat acting buckwild, boy you know that ain't your style\nPlus your thug profile is now reflecting on your child\nYou thinking that it couldn't happen\nBut then it happen\nAnd now you're rappin, came back to haunt you\nBecause you want to\nBe in her face puffin' li with your crew\nYou even let her take a sip or two upon your brew\nInstead of tryin to shed light, to keep her head right\nSo that she wouldn't do the things that the next kid might\nOh now you never did consider tho\nYour kid could go\nTrying to do the things she saw you do up in your video\nYou went upstairs thinking that she wasn't able\nSlipping, left your Glock sittin' pon the coffee table\nSo as you hang, with your gang, doin your thang\nBLOWE! unexpectedly to your ears the shot rang\nCame down, never thinking that you'd see what you saw\nRight there, layin in blood across your livin room floor\nSo now, as you sit in grief, total disbelief\nCause everything that ever mattered\nTo you is all shattered\nInstead of concentratin' heavily on what your rep be\nYou should have been thankful for your child like Cheryl Pepsi\nCause if you would have stayed aware\nTo whose in your care\nShe wouldn't be no casualty to your career\"\n\n[Chorus X2]\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhere did they find you?\nYou came into this game and let this new trend blind ya\nA&R's was wrong to sign ya\nYou gotta be true to this game to stay in the art\nBut guys like you get bent apart\nBecause you ain't got it in the heart\nRepresenting who? you better not be getting new\nHow you gonna be guerilla when you never been up in the zoo\nYour whole persona's theatrical\nAin't nothing bout you natural\nHere, show me now, how many gats you pull\nCause when you talk that talk\nYou gotta walk that walk\nOr leave it up to the real OG's up North\nCause those who dramatize, realize, and be advised\nYou couldn't handle 3 to 5\nCause many seeking fortune and fame\nGot caught in the game\nThinking the thug status was supporting the claim\nAll you gangsta acts y'all be guerillas on tracks\nBut relax, cause this is just wax\nTell em again\nYou gangsta acts be guerillas on tracks\nBut relax, cause this is just wax\nOne more time\nY'all gangsta acts y'all be guerillas on tracks\nBut relax, this just wax, nigga, damn\n\n[Chorus X2]"}}, {"title": "W.G.O.N.R.S.", "album": "Daddy's Home", "year": "1994-09-13", "lyrics": "[Big Daddy Kane]\nPeople people, we gotta get over\nBefore we go under, and I wonder\nWhy we can't find a little piece of mankind\nInstead of always step back, gimme my damn nine\nLivin the thug, like the shoot up the drug type\nThey love to hear the people sayin, \"Yo that kid is bugged right?\"\nJust a game, so please, out here men die\nThe average black man today don't make it to see twenty-five\nCause someone else got the clock rocked\nTryin to get the neighborhood locked, to be the new man on the block\nBut if you asked me who's the man I'm like, \"You tell me?\nI don't know, Ed Lover, Dr. Dre and Heavy D?\"\nI got my mind on comin up, if not in first place\nThen damnit I plan to be the first runner up\nBut it seems, I got a lot of problems under my belt\nAnd everday I gotta ask myself\n\n[Scoob]\nAh what's goin on, in our society\nWhat's goin on, in a de country\nWhat's goin on, in your community\nWhat's goin on, tell me\n\n[Reggae chat] - can't translate\n\n[Big Daddy Kane]\nI seen a kid freshly dipped with mad gold\nFifteen years old, with plenty drugs bein sold\nBut then somebody caught him for his Air Jordans\nHis drugs the cash and the jewels he was sportin\nYou wanna call your girl a B-I-T-C-H\nYou can't appreciate so now she's humpin your man, then she ain't\nCause when you teach her that ho mentality\nThey accept that as reality and give all your friends the skin\nYou need to show some love for your people\nAll men are created equal, that's why with everybody I always\nSpread love, and keep my pockets full of dol-dollars\nBut check it out now\nWe're not the uncivilized, the Kane?\nSo let's get it together, man we did it when we were slaves\nInstead of always tryin to blame someone else\nTake a look around, and ask yourself\n\n[Scoob]\nAh what's goin on, in your community\nWhat's goin on, in a dis country\nWhat's goin on, in our society\nWhat's goin on, whoahhhh\n\n[Reggae chat] - can't translate\n\n[Big Daddy Kane]\nNowadays it's all about provin you ain't nuttin soft\nAnd everybody's always talkin about bustin off\nBut that ain't where we gotta go, kid we can throw\nAnd handle this thing like Holyfield and blow\nThen when we get it off our chest, let's put it to rest\nAnd try to make some money progress\nBecause if I got a dollar, and you got ten\nAnd you can get a hundred from a friend if five others kick in\nShoot, we can take that stack and put it back\nIn a community that's black, to make our people attract\nLike somethin magnetic, cause word is bond it's pathetic\nWe always talkin about this piece of the pie\nBut it seems we can't get it\nUnless we field the life of a drug dealer\nAnd start stellin llello but you know where they go\nUp to the penile, because they chose to be wild\nAnd now you're upstate kid, uh, waitin patiently to see trial\nNow let that whole gangsta route slide\nThere's too much money and skins here on the outside\nFor me to ever let my freedom go\nCause I got mine, now get yous, and let me know\n\n[Scoob]\nAh what's goin on, in our society\nWhat's goin on, when you nah haf no money\nWhat's goin on, people on the street\nWhoahhh, why is it so..\n\n[Reggae chat] - can't translate", "image":

"[Big Daddy Kane]\nPeople people, we gotta get over\nBefore we go under, and I wonder\nWhy we can't find a little piece of mankind\nInstead of always step back, gimme my damn nine\nLivin the thug, like the shoot up the drug type\nThey love to hear the people sayin, \"Yo that kid is bugged right?\"\nJust a game, so please, out here men die\nThe average black man today don't make it to see twenty-five\nCause someone else got the clock rocked\nTryin to get the neighborhood locked, to be the new man on the block\nBut if you asked me who's the man I'm like, \"You tell me?\nI don't know, Ed Lover, Dr. Dre and Heavy D?\"\nI got my mind on comin up, if not in first place\nThen damnit I plan to be the first runner up\nBut it seems, I got a lot of problems under my belt\nAnd everday I gotta ask myself\n\n[Scoob]\nAh what's goin on, in our society\nWhat's goin on, in a de country\nWhat's goin on, in your community\nWhat's goin on, tell me\n\n[Reggae chat] - can't translate\n\n[Big Daddy Kane]\nI seen a kid freshly dipped with mad gold\nFifteen years old, with plenty drugs bein sold\nBut then somebody caught him for his Air Jordans\nHis drugs the cash and the jewels he was sportin\nYou wanna call your girl a B-I-T-C-H\nYou can't appreciate so now she's humpin your man, then she ain't\nCause when you teach her that ho mentality\nThey accept that as reality and give all your friends the skin\nYou need to show some love for your people\nAll men are created equal, that's why with everybody I always\nSpread love, and keep my pockets full of dol-dollars\nBut check it out now\nWe're not the uncivilized, the Kane?\nSo let's get it together, man we did it when we were slaves\nInstead of always tryin to blame someone else\nTake a look around, and ask yourself\n\n[Scoob]\nAh what's goin on, in your community\nWhat's goin on, in a dis country\nWhat's goin on, in our society\nWhat's goin on, whoahhhh\n\n[Reggae chat] - can't translate\n\n[Big Daddy Kane]\nNowadays it's all about provin you ain't nuttin soft\nAnd everybody's always talkin about bustin off\nBut that ain't where we gotta go, kid we can throw\nAnd handle this thing like Holyfield and blow\nThen when we get it off our chest, let's put it to rest\nAnd try to make some money progress\nBecause if I got a dollar, and you got ten\nAnd you can get a hundred from a friend if five others kick in\nShoot, we can take that stack and put it back\nIn a community that's black, to make our people attract\nLike somethin magnetic, cause word is bond it's pathetic\nWe always talkin about this piece of the pie\nBut it seems we can't get it\nUnless we field the life of a drug dealer\nAnd start stellin llello but you know where they go\nUp to the penile, because they chose to be wild\nAnd now you're upstate kid, uh, waitin patiently to see trial\nNow let that whole gangsta route slide\nThere's too much money and skins here on the outside\nFor me to ever let my freedom go\nCause I got mine, now get yous, and let me know\n\n[Scoob]\nAh what's goin on, in our society\nWhat's goin on, when you nah haf no money\nWhat's goin on, people on the street\nWhoahhh, why is it so..\n\n[Reggae chat] - can't translate"}}, {"title": "Keep 'Em on the Floor", "album": "Taste of Chocolate", "year": "1990-10-30", "lyrics": "1-2-3\nGive it to me\n\nGet on the dancefloor\nStart to

silk drawers stickin to me\nBut I can't stop, I gotta party\nLike a gun on the dancefloor and catch a body\nI might move real smooth\nThen again dance real silly\nJust like a hillbilly\nAs i make sure the beat is kept\nSo all the party people stay in step\nBecome a slave to the rhythm\nGrab someone of the opposite sex and dance with em\nPut your partner on the floor and face em\nThat shows a positive sign of unification\nAnd if all party goers could make this move\nWe'd be one nation under a groove\nSo let's try this, stop the violence\nThat can only result in peace from what I sense\nTo be straight to the point\nA little love and harmony - mh (it's the joint)\nSo build a nation, pump the bass and\nThe treble beyond the level of imagination\nSo the Big Daddy Kane can endure\nAnd the

I never left\nCause I'm everlastin and my rhymes keep blastin\nSoon as I pick up the pen and relate it to paper\nThat's the beginning\nAnd for you Filthy McNasty MC's, that's the ending\nCause when I grab the microphone just like a gun\nYou know them doo-run-run-run, them doo-run-run\nHeh, I'm not your ordinary lyricist\nNone'll compare at this, as far as raps, pssh\nI'm takin care of this\nI work the stage like a slavehand\nAnd keep the girls screamin' just like Captain Caveman\nI did shows at the same arena that held Ike and Tina\nAnd the Chi-Lites, song have you seein her\nPuttin' me on after Jennifer Holiday, ain't no thing\nBecause I still come off, after the fat lady sings\n\n[Hook] [repeat 4x]\n\n[Verse 2]\nHere we go, Shalamar style\nThat means the Second Time Around so pump the sound\nAs I progress to bless the mic and strike the stage\nEnraged arouse the crowd to jump and pump their fists\nAnd twist their waists with grace and clap and snap\nAnd move and groove cause I'm still, so, smooth\nIf you compare the Big Daddy to a Caddy\nI'd be an Allante, suave as Belafonte\nInterplanetary and extraordinary (hmm, what about poetic?)\nMmm, very!\nI've even heard it said that I was the ultimate\nWelllll.. maybe just a little bit\nAnd competition I'll explain to them\nThat this don't even pertain to them\nTo try to flow like this will crack your cranium\nSo to the rear and let the Prince of Darkness spark this\nLike a vampire, bloodthirsty, uhh, have mercy\n\n[Hook] [repeat 4x]\n\n[Verse 3]\nAs we enter into the third half, for this paragraph\nI wanna take all of the people that's leaping along with this tune\nTo another plateau they never been too -- as I continue\nWith somethin funky to get into\nGive me a James Brown, Funkadelic, or Prince beat\nAnd watch me turn the microphone to minced meat\nI tear the roof off the mother as soon as my lips pucker\nCause I'm a bad mother *TWEET!!*\n\n[Hook] [repeat 8x]\n\nI'm a baaaad man!"}}, {"title": "Get Down",

\"The wrath of Kane,\"\n\"Mister Cee got a master plan\"\n\"This is the house that\" \"Cee\" \"Built, y'all\""}}, {"title": "T.L.C.", "album": "Prince of Darkness", "year": null, "lyrics": "[Kane]\nQuestion.. what has he done, for you lately?\nTell me.. do y'all go for walks on the beach?\nI just wanna know, if you had dinner at the pond\nOr the drive-through at Mickey D's\nYou say the last movie y'all saw was _Jaws_? Mmm\nWell never fear baby, the Big Daddy is here\n\nI come up upon the scene to romance thee\nWith a little bit of T.L.C. to tickle your fancy\nGive you protection, warmth and affection\nMake sure you never feel any rejection\nWithout a doubt, I admire you, I have a desire to\nBe a more better man prior to\nYour past relationships, you've been datin\nWith all the wrong gentlemen, I'm more sentimental\nIn my own little way so (HEY!)\nWhattaya say about givin a play okay?\nCause I'm not here to impress you, I wanna caress you\nPosess you and bless you, nevertheless\nTo make you feel secure, and real sure\nMon cheri amore, pretty woman I adore\nDon't shed a tear never fear my dear I'll be there\nAnywhere with some Tender Lovin Care\n\nChorus: repeat 2X\n\nJust a little bit of T.L.C\nTender Lovin Care you'll get from me\nJust a little bit of T.L.C\nTender Lovin Care is what you need\n\n[Kane]\nIn the beginning I only wanted to be your friend\nBut then..\nIt may sound strange, but my feelings started to change\nAnd now I wanna sustain..\nSomethin more closer, give you the most of my love\nAnd my time and respect as opposed to\nSayin she's \"Just a Friend\"\nI may sound like Biz, but you know what time it is\nI want us to be together and benevolent\nWith reverance to give you the best relationship there ever been\nSo consider me as as as as as a-a-as your lover\nDamn baby, you make me stutter\nBut I'm still able to, clearly say to you\nThings that I feel *smooch* and kiss your navel too\nGivin much T.L.C\nAs I make love to you constantLY\n\nChorus\n\n[Kane]\nMay I?\nHe ever treat you with the\nProper amount of chivalry, would be so, mmmm\nBreak!\n\n* just the drums for a bit *\n\nBass!\n\n* bassline comes for a bit *\n\n* music by itself comes in, then.. *\n\n[Kane]\nI hope to form a special thing that we can cherish\nEverlasting, it won't perish\nEstablish a special thing that's based on love\nAnd trust, in other words, it's all about us\nYou won't have to ever search for Tender Lovin Care\nCause for you I got it right here\nYou'll never find none greater\nSincerely yours\nThe Smooth Operator\n\nChorus",

drive-through at Mickey D's\nYou say the last movie y'all saw was _Jaws_? Mmm\nWell never fear baby, the Big Daddy is here\n\nI come up upon the scene to romance thee\nWith a little bit of T.L.C. to tickle your fancy\nGive you protection, warmth and affection\nMake sure you never feel any rejection\nWithout a doubt, I admire you, I have a desire to\nBe a more better man prior to\nYour past relationships, you've been datin\nWith all the wrong gentlemen, I'm more sentimental\nIn my own little way so (HEY!)\nWhattaya say about givin a play okay?\nCause I'm not here to impress you, I wanna caress you\nPosess you and bless you, nevertheless\nTo make you feel secure, and real sure\nMon cheri amore, pretty woman I adore\nDon't shed a tear never fear my dear I'll be there\nAnywhere with some Tender Lovin Care\n\nChorus: repeat 2X\n\nJust a little bit of T.L.C\nTender Lovin Care you'll get from me\nJust a little bit of T.L.C\nTender Lovin Care is what you need\n\n[Kane]\nIn the beginning I only wanted to be your friend\nBut then..\nIt may sound strange, but my feelings started to change\nAnd now I wanna sustain..\nSomethin more closer, give you the most of my love\nAnd my time and respect as opposed to\nSayin she's \"Just a Friend\"\nI may sound like Biz, but you know what time it is\nI want us to be together and benevolent\nWith reverance to give you the best relationship there ever been\nSo consider me as as as as as a-a-as your lover\nDamn baby, you make me stutter\nBut I'm still able to, clearly say to you\nThings that I feel *smooch* and kiss your navel too\nGivin much T.L.C\nAs I make love to you constantLY\n\nChorus\n\n[Kane]\nMay I?\nHe ever treat you with the\nProper amount of chivalry, would be so, mmmm\nBreak!\n\n* just the drums for a bit *\n\nBass!\n\n* bassline comes for a bit *\n\n* music by itself comes in, then.. *\n\n[Kane]\nI hope to form a special thing that we can cherish\nEverlasting, it won't perish\nEstablish a special thing that's based on love\nAnd trust, in other words, it's all about us\nYou won't have to ever search for Tender Lovin Care\nCause for you I got it right here\nYou'll never find none greater\nSincerely yours\nThe Smooth Operator\n\nChorus"}},

know he'll back you up\nKick a rhyme spectacular, think the nigga think he Blacula\nI seen somebody trying to get him with sunlight\nSomehow it wasn't done right, then he just laced him with one bite\nGo for the jugular vein, that's my new thing\nHow did he do it with two fangs, think they were gold like Wu-Tang\nYour luck has been changed, you're left strucken with pain\nWell good for your ass kid, that's what you get for fucking with Kane\nSee, I creep on MCs like po' nine and take rhymes the whole nine\nTo dig in you rappers like a coalmine\nNow look what I dug me, somebody better turn me off or try to unplug me\nOoh it's starting to get ugly\nDon't miss this, hold on with a clenched fist\nAs I tongue the microphone down just like a french kiss\nRelentless with lyrics that be brutal, hip-hop I stay true to\nPut it on you like voodoo\n\nChorus\nUnda presha, niggas unfold and felt the heat\nPossessed with the Brooklyn techniques we freak\nAyyo Kane, hit us off with that shit one time\nThey can't believe it, infatuated hardcore rhymes\n\nWhen you digging out your girl from behind, you're gonna find\nThe reason that her eyes are closed, Black Caesar's on her mind\nYour royal smoothness, honeys out there know how it goes\nEven cabesa de pollos that habla Espanol\nDig this now, run for your life to get away but none do\nEven if you escape just tell me who can you run to\nTest the stupendous, tell me what was you to gain\nInternal bleeding due to Kane\nBoom bow bow, ooh the pain\nNobody's equal, keep it lethal and diesel, to see to the people\nAnd reach your cerebral cause that's how we do\nThe pain gets inflicted, fake MCs get evicted\nFace it, truth of the matter is just that I'm too hard to get with\nSince days of Pro Keds, I shined over mad heads, roll up on you like the feds\nRip your whole set to shreds\nA crash or a wreck, because I mash for respect\nOnly thing I want to know now is, is this cash or a check?\n\nChorus\n\nAin't no question, I'm suffering a bad case of lyrical congestion\nNot the one for testing\nCome mess with and end up with your chest split\nNo not because of cardiac, but because how hard he act\nI'm recognized as the microphone destroyer\nCompetition minds up in the state of paranoia\nI said if you're scared get a dog\nSo by tomorrow you'll probably see twenty rappers walking with Rottweilers\nYour gimmick is primitive and impotent\nYou won't win with it so limit it\nBefore I make your body start to hemorrhage\nJust when you thought that you was burning me\nYou found yourself bleeding internally\nNow you heads is learning see\nI stay in there sincere\nYou commence prayer, your heart begins fear cause there ain't no wins here\nHuh never kid, even with leverage\nI can rock your headpiece worse than the wop ever did\nI damage a amateur with a lack of stamina\nPetty grammar will leave you for the medical examiner\nYou come talking about some stay real\nI have you hitting high notes like Curtis cause

up\nKick a rhyme spectacular, think the nigga think he Blacula\nI seen somebody trying to get him with sunlight\nSomehow it wasn't done right, then he just laced him with one bite\nGo for the jugular vein, that's my new thing\nHow did he do it with two fangs, think they were gold like Wu-Tang\nYour luck has been changed, you're left strucken with pain\nWell good for your ass kid, that's what you get for fucking with Kane\nSee, I creep on MCs like po' nine and take rhymes the whole nine\nTo dig in you rappers like a coalmine\nNow look what I dug me, somebody better turn me off or try to unplug me\nOoh it's starting to get ugly\nDon't miss this, hold on with a clenched fist\nAs I tongue the microphone down just like a french kiss\nRelentless with lyrics that be brutal, hip-hop I stay true to\nPut it on you like voodoo\n\nChorus\nUnda presha, niggas unfold and felt the heat\nPossessed with the Brooklyn techniques we freak\nAyyo Kane, hit us off with that shit one time\nThey can't believe it, infatuated hardcore rhymes\n\nWhen you digging out your girl from behind, you're gonna find\nThe reason that her eyes are closed, Black Caesar's on her mind\nYour royal smoothness, honeys out there know how it goes\nEven cabesa de pollos that habla Espanol\nDig this now, run for your life to get away but none do\nEven if you escape just tell me who can you run to\nTest the stupendous, tell me what was you to gain\nInternal bleeding due to Kane\nBoom bow bow, ooh the pain\nNobody's equal, keep it lethal and diesel, to see to the people\nAnd reach your cerebral cause that's how we do\nThe pain gets inflicted, fake MCs get evicted\nFace it, truth of the matter is just that I'm too hard to get with\nSince days of Pro Keds, I shined over mad heads, roll up on you like the feds\nRip your whole set to shreds\nA crash or a wreck, because I mash for respect\nOnly thing I want to know now is, is this cash or a check?\n\nChorus\n\nAin't no question, I'm suffering a bad case of lyrical congestion\nNot the one for testing\nCome mess with and end up with your chest split\nNo not because of cardiac, but because how hard he act\nI'm recognized as the microphone destroyer\nCompetition minds up in the state of paranoia\nI said if you're scared get a dog\nSo by tomorrow you'll probably see twenty rappers walking with Rottweilers\nYour gimmick is primitive and impotent\nYou won't win with it so limit it\nBefore I make your body start to hemorrhage\nJust when you thought that you was burning me\nYou found yourself bleeding internally\nNow you heads is learning see\nI stay in there sincere\nYou commence prayer, your heart begins fear cause there ain't no wins here\nHuh never kid, even with leverage\nI can rock your headpiece worse than the wop ever did\nI damage a amateur with a lack of stamina\nPetty grammar will leave you for the medical examiner\nYou come talking about some stay real\nI have you hitting high notes like Curtis cause of pain that you may feel\nSo many tried to infiltrate but couldn't penetrate\nNow they disintegrate as money generate\nFrom who? The living legend, true indeed, hip hop veteran\nWhipass is probably out there but I swear I never met him\nGive me mine"}}, {"title": "Change This Game Around", "album": "Veteranz Day", "year":

my fault in, girls wreckless eyeballin\nAttraction is magnetic, they come and get it\nGame is all natural, yours is synthetic\nSo while you sittin' there tryin' to get your words straight\nI bag more dimes than workers at the herb gate\nUse tight D, on top of tight G\nWant it done rightly, girlfriend invite me\nI foresee what you hoping\nAnd say the right thangs to get you open, then I get you open\nLay it down from nighttime until the A.M\nWatch how I play 'em, lay 'em and then fillet 'em\nIn the kingdom I hit it like lottery\nBaby you gotta see, the Brooklyn prodigy\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's plain to see, your game is tight enough for me\nI jus can't keep my cool, I just gotta let it be\nAnd now you're in the zone\nAnd I'm sure when you play on\nThat the way you put it down\nIs gonna change this game around\n\n[Verse 2]\nSharp P-I till I return to the essence\nMaking my presence, glow like florescence\nI come around and get it like hot peas and butter\nDrop these and got her, that Kane he's a mother\nThe God don't minimize, I enterprise, when I rise\nIn the thighs, make 'em see doubles like geminis\nSo, bring it on me no sweat it\nBut you talk that Lil' Kim talk to me and end up bowlegged\nGive it to you good upon the mattress\n6 million ways to get yo' back twist\nNo theatrics when the Kane approach\nPut you in more positions than a football coach\nPimpin' ain't easy but we don't knock it do we\nInstead we spend chips, get fly, rockin jewelry\nWalk through the club with the girls lockin to me\nIt's all love in here baby now sock it to me\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI don't discriminate they come upon ease\nAsians, Haitians, even the mommies\nPlease lowdown stankin', plus Jamaican girl bangin'\nThem call me yard boy cause them seen something hangin'\nNever do I waste that, I put my face at, a place that\nIn case I wanna taste that\nComfort specialist, is as easy as this\nAh miss, yeah duke you better hold your on to her wrist\nI start roamin like car phones, and\nJust can't control my hormones and\nI make a move on a ten, and go and get a friend\nSo I can put my man in\nWhile you sittin' there drinkin', that glass of Cris\nI be sittin there thinkin', what's after this\nUs two, me and you is what's happenin'\nBodily in heat like an African (O.K.)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/55a075f6632f5b5a223681bd3f7a7ca8.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Big

get your thong damp\nI put it down till you girls catch a cramp\nTake a little trip with the smoothest guy walkin'\nUsually my fault in, girls wreckless eyeballin\nAttraction is magnetic, they come and get it\nGame is all natural, yours is synthetic\nSo while you sittin' there tryin' to get your words straight\nI bag more dimes than workers at the herb gate\nUse tight D, on top of tight G\nWant it done rightly, girlfriend invite me\nI foresee what you hoping\nAnd say the right thangs to get you open, then I get you open\nLay it down from nighttime until the A.M\nWatch how I play 'em, lay 'em and then fillet 'em\nIn the kingdom I hit it like lottery\nBaby you gotta see, the Brooklyn prodigy\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's plain to see, your game is tight enough for me\nI jus can't keep my cool, I just gotta let it be\nAnd now you're in the zone\nAnd I'm sure when you play on\nThat the way you put it down\nIs gonna change this game around\n\n[Verse 2]\nSharp P-I till I return to the essence\nMaking my presence, glow like florescence\nI come around and get it like hot peas and butter\nDrop these and got her, that Kane he's a mother\nThe God don't minimize, I enterprise, when I rise\nIn the thighs, make 'em see doubles like geminis\nSo, bring it on me no sweat it\nBut you talk that Lil' Kim talk to me and end up bowlegged\nGive it to you good upon the mattress\n6 million ways to get yo' back twist\nNo theatrics when the Kane approach\nPut you in more positions than a football coach\nPimpin' ain't easy but we don't knock it do we\nInstead we spend chips, get fly, rockin jewelry\nWalk through the club with the girls lockin to me\nIt's all love in here baby now sock it to me\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI don't discriminate they come upon ease\nAsians, Haitians, even the mommies\nPlease lowdown stankin', plus Jamaican girl bangin'\nThem call me yard boy cause them seen something hangin'\nNever do I waste that, I put my face at, a place that\nIn case I wanna taste that\nComfort specialist, is as easy as this\nAh miss, yeah duke you better hold your on to her wrist\nI start roamin like car phones, and\nJust can't control my hormones and\nI make a move on a ten, and go and get a friend\nSo I can put my man in\nWhile you sittin' there drinkin', that glass of Cris\nI be sittin there thinkin', what's after this\nUs two, me and you is what's happenin'\nBodily in heat like an African (O.K.)"}}, {"title": "Get Into It", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nAllow me to introduce myself\nAs the authentic, ultimate, def now is there anything

of Darkness\" album+ ]\n\n[ VERSE 1: Big Daddy Kane ]\nGive a demonstration\nTo the whole rap world rhythm nation\nAnd take a taste of this verbal vibration\nWith more color than you see on animation\nAnd bear witness to my smooth operation\nAs I give the party people a sensation\nAnd give them all a good feel of jubilation\nMe and the mic become a good combination\nTo rock the house without any complication\nThe crowd'll give the Kane a standing ovation\nThat just gives me even more motivation\nTo pick up the pace and give you more fascination\nWith the ryhmes in my rap creation\nThey show the power of the Kane's innovation\nAnd create an extravagant inspiration\nSo here I am, to give a demonstration\n\n[ Big Scoob ]\n(Give a demonstration)\n(Give) (give a demonstration)\n(G-)(give a demonstration)\n\n[ VERSE 2: Big Daddy Kane ]\nGive a demonstration\nAnd take time out for a dedication\nTo all the deejays and radio stations\nWho put my record in heavy rotation\nReprise reps for their affiliation\nOf course Warner Brothers help my elevation\nFor publicity to artist relation\nAnd Rushtown for a great three-year duration\nAnd Carol Lewis for the tour preparation\nAnd Farrakhan for the righteous conversations\nI can't forget the people all around the nation\nFrom the adults to the younger generation\nThe black, white, Chinese and even Haitian\nBecause the music ain't about segregation\nIt's a harmony to bring communication\nSo listen up as I give a demonstration\n\n[ Big Scoob ]\n(Give) (give a) (give) (give a demonstration)\n(Give) (g-) (give a demonstration)\n(Give a demonstration)\n\n[ VERSE 3: Big Daddy Kane ]\nGive a demonstration\nFor you to get a  much better illustration\nAnd give the sucker MC's an education\nBecause their style is just a cheap imitation\nIt seems you need a little bit of dictation\nBut what I'ma do for you in this situation\nIs supply a process of elimination\nServe justice by means of termination\nBecause a biter only brings aggravation\nA lotta trouble and a lotta frustration\nSo here's a little bit of useful information\nSo that you can see some acceleration\nIt's gonna take hard work and concentration\nA lotta tears and a lotta perspiration\nThat's the way that you blow up like inflation\nAnd then maybe YOU can give a demonstration\n\n[ Big Scoob ]\n(G-) (g-) (g-) (give) a demonstration)\n(Give) (g-) (g-) (give) (give a demonstration)\n(Give a) (g-) (g-)(give a demonstration)\n(G-) (g-) (g-) (give a demonstration)\n\n[ Big Scoob ]\nSo can I give a demonstration\nFor the sick people with constipation\nYou need to take a little bit of medication\nSo you can go take a dookie on the toilet\nKnow what I'm sayin?\nDo you know what I'm sayin?\nSo can we give this demonstration?\nSo yo\nMe and Big Daddy\nWe kickin it on the down low\nWord up\nWord up, just buggin in the studio\nKnow what I'm sayin?\nGivin all y'all party people out there a - little - bit of - de-mon-stration\nFor the year '91 me and Big Daddy gon' say peace"}}], "artist": "Big Daddy Kane"}
