(damn!)\nHundred-inch TV at my house\nI sit back like \"Damn, I look great on it!\" (damn, I look good!)\nI do not fuck with your new shit, my nigga\nDon't ask for my take on it (don't ask for my

Takeoff]\nVersace, Versace\nMedusa head on me like I'm Illuminati (Versace!)\nThis is a gated community\nPlease get the fuck off the property (gate!)\nRap must be changin'\n'Cause I'm at the top and ain't no one on top of me (woo!)\nNiggas be wantin' a verse for a verse\nBut man, that's not a swap to me (nah!)\nDrownin' in compliments\nPool in the backyard that look like Metropolis (Metropolis?)\nI think I'm sellin' a million first week\nMan, I guess I'm a optimist (milli!)\nBorn in Toronto but sometimes I feel like Atlanta adopted us (go!)\nWhat the fuck is you talkin' 'bout?\nSaw this shit comin' like I had binoculars, boy\nVersace, Versace\nWe stay at the mansion when we in Miami\nThe pillows Versace, the sheets are Versace\nI just won a Grammy (woo!)\nI been so quiet, I got the world like\n\"What the fuck is he plannin'?\" (What?)\nJust make sure that you got a back up plan\n'Cause that shit might come in handy (go, go!)\nStarted a label, the album is comin' September\nJust wait on it (just wait on it!)\nThis year I'm eatin' your food\nAnd my table got so many plates on it (so many!) (damn!)\nHundred-inch TV at my house\nI sit back like \"Damn, I look great on it!\" (damn, I look good!)\nI do not fuck with your new shit, my nigga\nDon't ask for my take on it (don't ask for my opinion!)\nSpeakin' in lingo, man, this for my nigga\nThat trap out the bando (bando, bando!)\nThis for my niggas that call up Fernando to move a piano (brr, brr, brr!)\nFuck all your feelin' 'cause business is business\nIt's strictly financial (business is business!)\nI'm always the first one to get it, man\nThat's how you lead by example (I got it!)\nVersace, Versace\nVersace, Versace, Versace, Versace (Versace!)\nWord in New York is the Dyckman and Heights girls are callin' me Papi (woo, woo)\nI'm all on the low\nTake a famous girl out where there's no paparazzi (flash!)\nI'm tryna give Halle Berry a baby and no one can stop me (smash!)\n\n[Chorus: Quavo]\nVersace, Versace, Versace, Versace\nVersace, Versace, Versace, Versace\nVersace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace\nVersace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace\n\n[Verse 2: Quavo]\nVersace, Versace\nMedusa head on me like I'm Illuminati\nI know that you like it\nVersace, my neck and my wrist is so sloppy\nVersace, Versace\nI love it, Versace, the top of my Audi\nMy plug, he John Gotti\nHe give me the ducks, I know that they're mighty\nShoes and shirt Versace\nYour bitch want in on my pockets\nShe ask me why my drawers silk\nI told that bitch \"Versace\"\nCheetah print on my sleeve\nBut I ain't never been in the jungle\nTry to take my sack\nBetter run with it, nigga, don't fumble\n\n[Chorus: Quavo]\nVersace,

Versace\nYou copped the Honda, I copped the Mazi\nYou smoke the mid, I smoke exotic\nI set the trend, you niggas copy\nCookin' this dope like I work at Hibachi\nLook at the watch, it blow hot like some Taki\nCome in my room, my sheet Versace\nWhen I go to sleep I dream Versace\nMedusa, Medusa, Medusa\nThese niggas, they wishin' they knew you\nThey coppin' the Truey, remixin' the Louis\nMy blunts is fat as Rasputia\nIn a striped shirt like I\u2019m Tony the Tiger\nI'm beatin' the pot, call me Michael\nLot of you niggas that copy\nLook at my closet, Versace, Versace\n\n[Chorus:

Versace, Medusa my wifey\nMy car is Versace, I got stripes on my Mazi\nI'm dressin' so nicely they can't even copy\nYou'd think I'm Egyptian, this gold on my body\nMoney my mission, two bitches\nThey

grippin'\nThem bands in my pocket, you know that I\u2019m livin'\nI'm draped up in gold, but no Pharaoh\nRockin' handcuffs: that's Ferragamo\nBricks by the boat, overload\nI think I'm the don but no Rocco\nThis the life that I chose\nBought out the store, can't go back no more\nVersace my clothes while I'm sellin' them bows\nVersace take over, it took out my soul\n\n[Chorus: Quavo]\nVersace,

In the Pharrell-produced song, Migos drop fast food references and flaunt their success.\n\nThis marks the first time in a long time that the trio strayed away from their signature Atlanta trap sound and rap over a poppier beat.\n\nAccording to Quavo, they ran into Pharrell in Los Angeles when the N.E.R.D frontman stepped into one of their studio sessions with a \u201cpack\u201d of beats from 2008 earmarked for the Atlanta trio:\n\nWe was in the studio in L.A. and he was in the next room. We had been running into each other, we\u2019ve been cool, but he was over there working and he just stepped in because we just walk in everybody\u2019s sessions and it\u2019s love, and go to work. And Pharrell had, like, three or four beats, but the pack was from 2008, like, the old hard drive. He had the old pack. He said he was waiting on this moment. The genie way.\n\nThe beat was originally intended for an unreleased T.I. song. Twitter user Erik Anderson pinpointed the track as \u201cTrap Nigga Hustle,\u201d which was recorded two years prior to the Atlanta rapper\u2019s 2014 album Paperwork. T.I. mentioned it during an interview with DJ Whoo Kid and previewed the instrumental in a Vevo segment about his car collection:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Yr4TTzI2xgA"}, "embed_content": "<div

In the Pharrell-produced song, Migos drop fast food references and flaunt their success.\n\nThis marks the first time in a long time that the trio strayed away from their signature Atlanta trap sound and rap over a poppier beat.\n\nAccording to Quavo, they ran into Pharrell in Los Angeles when the N.E.R.D frontman stepped into one of their studio sessions with a \u201cpack\u201d of beats from 2008 earmarked for the Atlanta trio:\n\nWe was in the studio in L.A. and he was in the next room. We had been running into each other, we\u2019ve been cool, but he was over there working and he just stepped in because we just walk in everybody\u2019s sessions and it\u2019s love, and go to work. And Pharrell had, like, three or four beats, but the pack was from 2008, like, the old hard drive. He had the old pack. He said he was waiting on this moment. The genie way.\n\nThe beat was originally intended for an unreleased T.I. song. Twitter user Erik Anderson pinpointed the track as \u201cTrap Nigga Hustle,\u201d which was recorded two years prior to the Atlanta rapper\u2019s 2014 album Paperwork. T.I. mentioned it during an interview with DJ Whoo Kid and previewed the instrumental in a Vevo segment about his car collection:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Yr4TTzI2xgA"}, "comment_count": 2, "community":

print my resume\nTalking crazy, I pull up andale\nR.I.P to Nate Dogg, I had to regulate\nPocket rocket fire, watch him disintegrate\nIt's a truckload coming on the interstate\nSirloin steak all on my dinner plate\nYour main bitch say she wanna make a sex tape\nRich nigga, I could never be a broke nigga (rich nigga)\nBroke niggas, I can never get along with them\nAlways been hated since a little nigga (always)\nIt's forever pussy nigga gotta deal with it (rich nigga!)\n\n[Hook: Takeoff]\nBroke niggas stand to the left\nMy rich niggas stand to the right\nLil' mama, she keep looking at me (lil'

Deebo\nNow who's that talking that gangsta shit?\nSomebody gonna kick your ass\nWhen I walk up in the club I better make a thunderstorm\nLet them know that this a whole lot of cash\nRich niggas on the right, all night (rich nigga)\nBroke niggas to the left, by yourself (brokanese)\nNow who the hell just said that the roof on fire?\nCall 911 like Wyclef\n\n[Hook: Takeoff]\nBroke niggas stand to the

nigga, I don't deal with you\nAll of my niggas, official, my bitches they skrippers\nMy niggas they criminals trying to get to the M&Ms\nIf your bitch is so innocent, why she sucking my children\nLights, camera, action, diamond dancing bitch we go in the building\nBad bitch make it clap, like Magnolia\nYoung rich nigga on the couch talking to Oprah\nBottles in the VIP while I stand on the sofa\nI don't speak your language, Brokanese, I thought I told ya\nThese bitches they be smokin' on hookah, my nigga ballin' like Hoosiers\nPull up in the Double R, go scare ya bitch, Freddy

habits.\n\nAlthough \u201cWhat the Price\u201d has not received the wild success of \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d and \u201cT-Shirt\u201d, the single  is a very worthy trap anthem, drawing off samples from Lil Bibby\u2019s \u201cSteph\u201d, and Swipey\u2019s  \u201cIntro\u201d."}, "comment_count": 2, "community": true, "custom_preview": null, "has_voters": true, "id": 11123739, "pinned": false,

nigga but the Migos got the title\nSo now niggas dabbing, don't know how it happen\nI been touchdown on you niggas ask Madden\nDon't forget bitch I'm the dab daddy\nIn stores now YRN fashion (Yung Rich Nation!)\nPipe it up, bitch it's gon' be the new anthem\nI come through swervin in a black Panamera\nPull out the camo when you see me Christian Louboutin, hopping out that's an animal\nNow remember, fore we made this song, nobody said pipe it up\nNext thing we dropping, we gon' fuck em up, have everybody screaming pipe it up\nPipe it up in the club while I'm on drugs\nA nigga fucking up

my dab, got me feelin' like I'm Fab\nLook at my dab, spreadin' dab across the map (Oh)\nI'm dabbin' when I walk up in the trap\nI look at the pot, I'm like \"get in there!\" (Get in there)\nI play with the water need swimwear (Swim)\nLook at my dab, get in there! (Get in there)\n\n[Chorus: Quavo]\nLook at my dab, dab\nLook at my dab, bitch dab\nLook at my dab, bitch dab\nLook at my dab, bitch dab\nLook at my dab, bitch dab\nLook at my dab, bitch dab\nLook at

Rich Nation gear\nLookin' like I'm not from 'round here\nYoung nigga dabbin' out the atmosphere\nYou niggas still sayin' swag\nMy niggas switched it up we call it dab\nStep out with a light dab I call it a jab\nMichael Jordan I'm perfecting my craft\nNo money counter, count it up with my hands\nYoung nigga, I can show you how to do math\nSippin' on drank and I pour up some muddy\nMy nigga not tryin' to remember my past\nDon't come to my hood if you ain't got a pass\nEat up the dab like linguini and crab\nMr. McMahon, I fire you and your staff\nWatchin' you niggas dabbin' made me laugh (Haha)\nDabbin' is a way of fashion, touchdown like I'm Takeoff McFadden\nCall a play like I'm Takeoff John Madden\nShould get a platinum plaque from all this dabbin'\nYou niggas should get a Grammy, the way you actin'\nEnough of that swag I put it in a casket\nLook at my dab, yo bitch droppin' her panties\nI feel fantastic, immaculate dabbin'\nStay off my grass, call me Takeoff Stanley\n\n[Chorus: Quavo]\nLook at my dab, dab\nLook at my dab, bitch dab\nLook at my dab, bitch dab\nLook at my dab, bitch dab\nLook at my dab, bitch dab\nLook at my dab, bitch dab\nLook at my dab,

that it's just a dance\nWhen dabbin' is a way of fashion\nSee I'm tryin' to teach y'all the rules and regulations\nCause there's a lot of niggas out here perpetrating\nNo temptations, Migos sensation\nSeen a lot of faces, why not make a Young Rich Nation"}}, {"title": "Wishy Washy", "album": "Rich Nigga Timeline", "year": "2014-11-05", "lyrics": "[Hook: Quavo]\nYou know these hoes wishy

nobody\nThis bitch is a vegetarian, all she want is broccoli\nI told her if she knew better, she would prolly do better\nThat Rolex is a Sky-Dweller, got gold all on my Margielas\nPullin' up in a Bentley, no Mr. Bentley\nShe askin' me where my umbrella\nFox fur, put on my mink, chinchilla\nFlawless diamonds, it's gon' be a cold winter, burr, burr\nDon't wanna fuck you, lil' mama, I just want head\nThese bitches, they can't wait to open their legs\nBut soon as she pull in my driveway\nPull up to my front door, she got the panties in her hand\nShe know how to work the pots and pans\nShe watchin' me like I'm on demand\nShe the bomb, Osama Bin (Osama Bin Laden!)\n\n[Hook: Quavo]\nYou know these hoes wishy washy\nThey'll fuck your partner\nTake all of your guala, take your wallet\nYou

from him\nTook the first PJ across the country, got too hot for a moment\nThey say he got work, now I own it\nNow my squad, they going up, no Makonnen\nIn the players pad at the Caesar's Palace\nOut in Las Vegas, like I'm Roman\nAll types of Euros and Yen\nI got money in Berlin\nI told the Lord forgive me for my sins\nCause I don't wanna do it again\n\n[Chorus: Quavo]\nCross the country, cross the country\nYou may never been there, catch me cross the country\nCross the country, cross the country\nCoca leaves and palm trees, we cross the country\nCross the country, cross the country\nShe don't understand English but she want me\nCross the country, cross the country\nI had to get a Visa cause I'm in and out the country", "image":

like Rambo\nI'm feelin' like Harry Houdini\nThe pack was just here did you see it\nThe plug he be here any second now\nIf he didn't then something went down\nWe losing our bags, gotta go to the

I'm havin' paper\nHow you gon' big on big?\nIf you havin' neighbors and I'm havin' acres\nHow you gon' big on big?\nIf I got the Draco and you got the Sig\nHow you gon' big on big?\nIf I'm trappin' that gas, you trappin' that mid\nHow you gon' big on big?\nIf I pull out a dub, you pull out a ten\nHow you gon' big on big?\nIf your bitch is a five, my bitch is a ten\nHow you gon' big on big?\nYou drivin' a Jag, I'm pushin' a Benz\nHow you gon' big on big?\nWhat you talkin' about? We done been did\nHow you gon' big on big?\n\n[Verse 1: Takeoff]\nHow you gon' big on big?\nHow you go Sig on Driz?\nHow you pour one up the seal?\nHow you gon' do what I did?\nNigga don't know how it feel\nHow you gon' say you is real?\nNigga lyin' sayin' he havin' Act' seal\nBut we both know that ain't real\nNigga lyin' 'bout a quarter mill\nHe ain't touch it or know how it feel\nNigga talkin' 'bout they independent\nTurned around and 360 the deal\nNigga walkin' 'round with 30s on them\nBut they know they ain't ready to kill\nAll my niggas havin' cookie bags\nVacuum sealed and ready to sell\nM&M in the mail, I done took a lot of L's\nHundred niggas with the shells, goin' big, whale\nPullin' out V12, pickin' up a plate at Kelz\n\n[Verse 2: Quavo]\n(Can't go big on big)\nWe the biggest shit poppin', wrist water, no faucet\nBando to a mansion, you havin' condo status\nCan't go big and braggin', havin' real big passion\nEver since I was a lil boy, yeah, I'm havin' Huncho status\nCan't compare to this, I'm takin' all the risks\nKnow how to solve a problem, know how to sell a brick\nYou might be poppin' them bottles, I'm poppin' them bottles and models\nYou might be ridin' American, my whips is foreign, the throttles\nYou tryna go big on big?, stop it\nI put a big... hole... in your pocket\nThey say they ridin' around the city broke\nThat's 'cause they tryna keep up with the 'cho (keep up!)\nEyes closed, whippin' it blind fold\nShe get on that blow, get bi-polar\nSix cell phones and I ain't social\nStill goin' big, cup like Magnolia\n\n[Hook: Takeoff]\nIf you havin' paper and I'm havin' paper\nHow you gon' big on big?\nIf you havin' neighbors and I'm havin' acres\nHow you gon' big on big?\nIf I got the Draco and you got the Sig\nHow you gon' big on big?\nIf I'm trappin' that gas, you trappin' that mid\nHow you gon' big on big?\nIf I pull out a dub, you pull out a ten\nHow you gon' big on big?\nIf your bitch is a five, my bitch is a ten\nHow you gon' big on big?\nYou drivin' a Jag, I'm pushin' a Benz\nHow you gon' big on big?\nWhat you talkin' about? We done been did\nHow you gon' big on big?\n\n[Verse 3: Offset]\nHow you gon'... flex on the squad?\nWhen you know... the bag is large?\nWhere were you... when times was hard?\nIt's pitiful, how you gon' big when we extra large?\nFour car garage... two bad broads\nI don't flex or floss... I'm a rockstar\nWith no guitar, Lambo avatar (Lambo)\nSippin' on some tar (Act) I'm livin' above the bar\nWrist on froze, wrist on froze (ice)\nYour lil' hoe... been my hoe (smash smash)\nGreen Lambo... Piccolo (skrr skrr)\nDiamonds drippin' on me, Nickelodeon (splash)\nYou goin' too big, you talkin' 'bout money, you bother me\n(you makin' me sick)\nI own all of my cars, jewelry, and I got property\n(I got some property)\nBuilding these houses in places, I'm playing Monopoly\nPlease do not talk to me\nYou don't do nothin', you obsolete\n\n[Hook: Takeoff]\nIf you havin' paper and I'm havin' paper\nHow you gon' big on big?\nIf you havin' neighbors and I'm havin' acres\nHow you gon' big on big?\nIf I got the Draco and you got the Sig\nHow you gon' big on big?\nIf I'm trappin' that gas, you trappin' that mid\nHow you gon' big on big?\nIf I pull out a dub, you pull out a ten\nHow you gon' big on big?\nIf your bitch is a five, my bitch is a ten\nHow you gon' big on big?\nYou drivin' a Jag, I'm pushin' a Benz\nHow you gon' big on big?\nWhat you talkin' about? We done been did\nHow you gon' big on big?\n\n[Outro: Quavo]\nCan't go big on big\nCan't go big on big\nCan't go big on big\nCan't go big on big"}}, {"title": "Versace", "album": "Young Rich Niggas",

your way, yeah yeah, ooh\nYou always going out your way, yeah, ooh\nYeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 1: Quavo]\nI won't ask the bitch unless she goin' to get it\nIt might take a minute, but she'll be sure to get it\nJust to pass the test, I won\u2019t act the best\nI got Actavis, there's nothing I can't ask the bitch, no\nNot one missed call, no missed calls, hell nah, nah\nShe got a man, can't get involved, no, nah, nah\nShe still going all ways every time I call\nWe gonna ball today, aye, we gonna ball tomorrow\nI put this weight on like I put a cape on\nNow that this fame came, I can see the hate on you\nMama told me stay strong, grandma told me stay on\nNow she looking down, throwin' blessings\n\n[Hook: Quavo]\nYou always going out your way\nYou always dropping off your flav, yeah\nYou always

out\nGo out your way to mom's house\nGo out your way, so out your way\nYou going out your way to come back around\nYou go out your way, you keep cool\nYou go out your way, you break rules\nGo out your way, so out your way\nYou're going out your way, you can't lose\nVacay trips to Cancun, spaceships, trips to the moon\nNever likes to tell the truth\nHead full of hair, but the cat well groomed\nPlan a trip to Peru (plan it), charter jet, me and you\nYou going out your way, way out your way\nSo I had to do this for you\nJackpot, hit the right spot, so she had to get a tattoo\nIt's some dirt and hurt, but ain't perfect\nAnd she gone always, come through\nHold me down, either good or bad\nNever switch or act brand new\nGo out your way and wasn't told to\nSo I made this song just for you\n\n[Hook: Quavo]\nYou always going out your way\nYou always dropping off your flav, yeah\nYou always going out your way\nYou never ask me to repay, no\nYou always going out your way, yeah, yeah, ooh\nYou always going out your way, yeah, ooh\nYeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 3: Offset]\nI put my heart and my soul in it\nGet to the money, then double it\nAll of these bitches, they loving me\nBut you had my back from the other beef (yeah)\nShe bending over, back for me\nMade a deal that you wouldn't cross, lie to me\nIt was so many people that doubted me\nShit talk, shit talk, bullets start to let off\nJack Frost, Jack Frost, wrist cost a whole house\nBlast off, blast off, my career gon' blast off\nWe don't need y'all, want y'all, we don't have to ask y'all\nI been fucking on the gnats, nigga, all day\nRide through the city, yeah, the ball way\nWe was trappin', cappin' all through the hallway\nEverybody said that we would fall away\nNobody thought that we would go up\nBut we blew up, blew up, blew up\nFuckin' on a thot on the tour bus\nGoing out your way for the two of us\n\n[Hook: Quavo]\nYou always going out your way\nYou always dropping off your flav, yeah\nYou always going out your

at your children\nPull up and kill 'em don't care bout no feelings\nI pop out and shoot at the city\nI'm cooking big birds and chickens\nI pull up with tons and tons of them midgets\nI'm going far as the stars, are you afraid of heights?\nThe sky is my limit\nYou're bittersweet like a lemon\nHey I'ma move you up to Beverly but not the Center\nHey Young Thug gon' bite that fish just like its tenders\nThe way I'm geek'd up don't know one of my members\nHannah Montana, banging in red bandana\n10 thousand dollars toe ring right inside of my sandals\nMy bitch understand us, she ride with the nana\nShe don't give no fuck 'bout no cameras (Bling bitch!)\nShe got her a lawyer not goin' to the slammer\nPlus she did trial in a Phantom (Rich bitch!)\nImma pull up leave it running, I walk in the club\nDon't play I snuck the gun in\nMy bitch think she dreaming cause I grabbed the Tommy\nShe thought that I grabbed on my stomach (tummy!)\nCook so much dope it startin to look just like comic\nIt could make a young kid vomit\nCatch a dumb ho, hook her up to phonics\nI'm slick and ironic\n\n[Verse 2: Quavo]\nI'm taking your bitch out to Beverly Hills\nAnd I didn't give her nothing but a molly pill\nI'm the Fresh Prince and I live on a mansion, young nigga my daddy not Phil\nMe and Young Thugga we drank muddy trouble\nMy pockets inflating like I blew a bubble\nWhen the mixtape dropping Migo?\nYoung nigga just wait on it! You acting like undercover (12!)\nIn the kitchen and I'm whipping the pot\nAnd it's getting thick on me like peanut butter (\"Baw, glaw !\")\nShort with the gwalla, I'm coming at you like the headhunter\n\n[Verse 3: Takeoff]\nPull up on you and your people\nMe and my Migos illegal but that choppa legal\nGuiseppes Zanotti black and white, they zebras\nSet the bitch off like I'm Queen Latifah\nIn Puerto Rico kicking it with Carlito\nHe put me on Chico he gave me a kilo\nYou fuck niggas taking my lingo\nPull up on you get my shit back like I'm repo\nThugger my brother we got different mothers\nWe fucking these bitches you cuffin' her\nBet you don't know she be sucking me while you've be kissing her!\nOffset fucked her, Quavo fucked her, but you fucking that bitch with no rubber\nThese bitches be trippin', fucked all my brothers\nAnd expect for me to love her! (I could never love her)\n\n[Verse 4: Offset]\nPull up and I got the Tommy aim it at yo' head I turn it to an omelette\nI'm connected like Vonage I run to the money I'm faster than Sonic\nYou an informant I hang you like ornaments\nGot pics in my mansion Mozart did the portraits\nGot your bitch in the condo I'm all in her ovary\n'Sace my chest out like I am with Jodeci\nI'm a wizard with bricks, Harry Potter, do sorcery\nI'm at the top and no nigga is over me\nRun in yo' house like I'm Jeeper Creeper\nPour a 4 in the 2 liter\nChristian Louboutin, walking on hyena\nStraight out the trenches I use an egg-beater I whip up a beamer\nBeat it like Tina, beat it like Jackson\nI beat the pot my knuckle got a damn fracture\nAdd up the digits my nigga money on top of money, fractions\nMy niggas they all about action, no camera\nPull out the choppa, it hit yo' ass hard like the judge, with the hammer\nYou niggas is monkey\nThat's why the choppa got a Hundred-round hanging, banana\nThese bitches be asking me questions like\n'Offset why the hell you walking on mammals?'\nBitch because I am an animal\nWatching me like I'm a channel\nI got the white call it Pamela, Anderson\nWhite Lambo Jennifer Aniston\nBlack diamonds, I call it African\nOffset fresher than a mannequin\nYRN plugged in with Rich Gang\nWe got plenty money, diamond chains\n\n[Verse 5: Young Thug]\nI drank a 4 and now I'm leanin'\nShe drank her a 4 and now we leanin'\nI didn't even cry homie\nHow I feel when I lean...\nHow many, how many, how many, goin with me\nHow many Ms, I got circles ain't no Mickey Ds\nMigos got a birdie of it\nThrow away the cutlass get a Panoramic\nHey, Mama gotta mansion now she perfect\nSpared my last mill but it turned out to be worth it\nShe just wanna do it for the Vine\nShe just wanna do it cause she know that she a dime\nIf you ain't got no rollie she do not waste her time\nI don't want your weed boy you're smoking on pines, nigga"}}, {"title":

nigga couldn't get out\nI'm rich as a bitch with a smart mouth\nLike Martin do Pam, bitch get out\nExcuse a nigga if I'm acting rude\nYou was not there when I had no food\nYou want to start over I'm not a fool\nThese bitches not loyal she broke the rules\nTrifling bitch I'm not wifing it\nLeft a nigga when I got indicted\nYou fucked my partner tryna keep it silent\nMy diamonds shining like the police sirens\nMy plug on the boat like a pirate\nPussy niggas they don't like me\nReal niggas fuckin' with me\nBaby girl you wasn't with me\n\n[Hook: Quavo]\nWhere were you when I was whipping it in

of my niggas convicted to prison (sad to say)\nWhen you at the top you don't want to look down, you don't want to look down\nIn a submarine underwater, you don't know how I'm feeling right now\n\n[Verse 2: Quavo]\nAll of my life, I only wanted nothing but Franklin\nTouchdown on a fuck nigga\nMake him tuck in his shell like he Franklin\nYou and my niggas are not the same\nI jumped out the Lamb' like Bruce Wayne\nThe ten-piece of chicken is on the way\nI told 'em Carlito to andale\nYou see them new niggas in the back of the club\nJust look at them plottin' in conversations\nI know they don't know!\nI sent the Migos to come back to the bando for translation\nCamera rollin', Quavo Spike Lee\nHeroin black, look like Willie B\nIf you do the coke, you gon' buy some skis\nIf you in our trap, you gon' buy some ki's\n\n[Hook: Quavo]\nI bet you didn't know that my niggas make millions (bet you didn't know)\nIt's sad to say some of my niggas convicted to prison (sad to say)\nWhen you at the top you don't want to look down, you don't want to look down\nIn a submarine underwater, you don't know how I'm feeling right now\n\n\n[Verse 3: Takeoff]\nYoung Takeoff, I am a professional\nVegetarian, only eat vegetables\nI got some kush you can roll up\nAnd I got some kush you can eat that is edible\nStretching the work like I'm Mr. Incredible\nYou ain't never seen no work as flexible\nAnd I turn on the stove, and I'm whipping the brick\nFor that pay my, nigga turn to Predator\n\n[Verse 4: Offset]\nI bet you didn't know I was twenty-two\nWin the judge ten times, what a miracle\nMe and my son identical, seventeen years old\nI had him I didn't know what to do\nI had to put food on the plate!\nAsking the Lord, \"give a nigga some faith\"\nNow when I wake up I look at my lake\nMy foot on the pedal not touching the brake\nNo chess but, nigga, I got me a check!\n\n[Hook: Quavo]\nI bet you didn't know that my niggas make millions (bet you didn't know, M&Ms)\nIt's sad to say some of my niggas convicted to prison (sad to say, bricks)\nWhen you at the top you don't want to look down, you don't want to look down\nIn a submarine underwater (splash), you

What we finna do?\"\nWhatever you wanna do\nI said where you just came from?\nShe just came from a photoshoot\nShe ask me what's YRN\nI said that mean Yung Rich Nation\nThat's another

the curves on your waist\nWhen you with me you can feel safe\nYour hair, nails, and your bills paid\nI'm not gon' leave you the wrong way\nI'm not gon' feed you the wrong plate\nShow you manners like my momma say\nYou might meet my momma just one day\nTuxedo on feng-shui\nSmoke a blunt in peace, Gandhi\nCeline on her from the runway\nOne of one, only one made\n\n[Chorus: Quavo]\nGirl you standin'

KLAW, know they gone feel me\nWhippin' that Brittney, that Whitney, that Lindsay\nLike I'm a chemist, treat em like dentist\nYou showing your benjis on Instagram flexing\nMaybe tonight, but ain't got a session\nI hate to be you cause I know its depressing\nMust think its a salad the way that I'm dressing\nI walk up in Neiman, I see it I cop it\nI pull out my pocket, you pull out your wallet\nWho you impressing, you know you ain't got it\nDiggin' through pockets, changing the topic\nNigga just stop it, it hurt me to see you ain't got it\nMake me wanna come out my pocket\nI'ma get it back cause a nigga got a sack, so my lil' double cup got filled full of the Act\nYoung nigga got bricksquad, we crack\nIf a nigga talkin' back, I'm aimin' the strap\nIt's a brand new day, in a brand new whip, and a brand new 45 sittin' in my lap\n\n[Hook]\nIt's a brand new day and the birds they chirpin'\nIt's a brand new day plus my Nextel chirpin' (brrrt-brrrrt)\nYa'll niggas got work but you ain't never

new Glock\nKnock em off the block like he playing hopscotch\nMy niggas is crazy, we keep the new babies\nWe ride in Mercedes keep crack like the 80s\nThey cook it, they whippin', they slavin'\nI ride 'round the city screaming \"Mama we made it!\"\nI'm busting them bricks out the wrapper\nToo hot for a trapper, so now I'mma rapper\nMy pot too big, got too much water, so I skrt-skrt with a boat paddle\nI see you running with the sack\nQuavo the linebacker so I had to make the tackle\nGot Migos in Mexico right now, putting 50 bricks on a horse saddle\nI'm servin' them patients, my money is ancient\nMy diamonds are lookin' like I bought a ice glacier\nAddicted to paper, I movin' to Cali\nI roll me a blunt and I go watch the Lakers\nSo much gas you'll need a ventilator\nMy house so big got marijuana acres\nPots and the pans, Quavo the baker, molly in the jar, look like a saltshaker\n\n[Hook]\nIt's a brand new day and the birds they chirpin'\nIt's a brand new day plus my Nextel

leaning, I feel like I'm fallin'\nBut really I'm trippin'\nOnly wear Bally's when I rock the Bentley\nGas so loud, y'all niggas can't hear me\nPull out that KLAW, know they gone feel me\nWhippin' that Brittney, that Whitney, that Lindsay\nLike I'm a chemist, treat em like dentist\nYou showing your benjis on Instagram flexing\nMaybe tonight, but ain't got a session\nI hate to be you cause I know its depressing\nMust think its a salad the way that I'm dressing\nI walk up in Neiman, I see it I cop it\nI pull out my pocket, you pull out your wallet\nWho you impressing, you know you ain't got it\nDiggin' through pockets, changing the topic\nNigga just stop it, it hurt me to see you ain't got it\nMake me wanna come out my pocket\nI'ma get it back cause a nigga got a sack, so my lil' double cup got filled full of the Act\nYoung nigga got bricksquad, we crack\nIf a nigga talkin' back, I'm aimin' the strap\nIt's a brand new day, in a brand new whip, and a brand new 45 sittin' in my lap\n\n[Hook]\nIt's a brand new day and the birds they chirpin'\nIt's a brand new day plus my Nextel chirpin' (brrrt-brrrrt)\nYa'll niggas got work but you ain't never ever working\nThrowin' money in the club when you know your pockets hurting\n\n[Verse 2: Quavo]\nAye hold up Takeoff, you see that nigga\nIt's a brand new nigga on the block, hit his ass with a brand new Glock\nKnock em off the block like he playing hopscotch\nMy niggas is crazy, we keep the new babies\nWe ride in Mercedes keep crack like the 80s\nThey cook it, they whippin', they slavin'\nI ride 'round the city screaming \"Mama we made it!\"\nI'm busting them bricks out the wrapper\nToo hot for a trapper, so now I'mma rapper\nMy pot too big, got too much water, so I skrt-skrt with a boat paddle\nI see you running with the sack\nQuavo the linebacker so I had to make the tackle\nGot Migos in Mexico right now, putting 50 bricks on a horse saddle\nI'm servin' them patients, my money is ancient\nMy diamonds are lookin' like I bought a ice glacier\nAddicted to paper, I movin' to Cali\nI roll me a blunt and I go watch the Lakers\nSo much gas you'll need a ventilator\nMy house so big got marijuana acres\nPots and the pans, Quavo the baker, molly in the jar, look like a saltshaker\n\n[Hook]\nIt's a brand new day and the birds they chirpin'\nIt's a brand new day plus my Nextel chirpin'(brrrt-brrrrt)\nYa'll niggas got work but you ain't never ever working\nThrowin' money in the club when you know your pockets hurting"}}, {"title": "Young Rich Niggas (No Label 2)", "album": "No Label II", "year": "2014-02-01",

tentacles\nMy mansion looking historical\n24 karats surrounding my portrait\nTry me leave you a memorial\nOff in the river they finding you snorkeling\nMy bitches addicted to Michael Kors\nVery \"sadiddy\" items just like Tom Ford\nI got the white like a chalkboard\nBreak in the trap you gon' pay for it\n20 pairs of Christian Louboutins\nPick a shoe, pick a shoe, pick a shoe\nThey asking bout what it is to beef with you rappers\nSorry I don't want an interview\nThundershock the pot like Pikachu (PIKA!)\nWhere is my revenue?\nThey investigating like the Blue's Clues\nMomma said try different avenues\nMost of my people they didn't believe until I turned into a Hercules\nEver since day one we took off\nI talked to God, he said 'Murda please!'\n\n[Chorus: Quavo]\nPeek a boo\nMy

mansion\nWondering how the fuck did this shit happen\nThe blogs, they say I be snapping\nMaking a movie, lights, camera, action\nI'm beating the pot, knuckles gotta fraction\nWe invented the flow niggas got it packed\nWhen we walk in the club we the main attraction\nToo much smoke in the room, breathing like Toni Braxton\nThese bitches they loving our personality\nYou niggas so sweet I might catch a cavity\nI'm the king of this shit nigga I'm your majesty\nDrinking lean and my bitch drinking Daiquiri\n\n[Chorus: Quavo]\nPeek a boo\nMy diamonds Pikachu\nPikachu (eww, fuck out my face)\nNo

jeweler\nI bought a Yacht-Master, the master yacht\nI just bought a Bentley Mulsanne\nThey callin' me samurai the way I chop the top\nSteve Nash, I pass the rock\nShaquille O'Neal  how I block a shot\nThree Amigos I might chill at the sharks\nBooting your bitch up with molly rocks\nThat Rolex ain't real if it tic-toc\nThey asking me when is the mixtape gon' drop\nPeekaboo all of my diamonds shining\nPissy my diamonds in China\nMy necklace dripping down my spinal\nI'm richer than Richie no Lionel\nLil' kids they call me their idol\nCause I inspire and you expire\n\n[Chorus: Quavo]\nPeek a

the stacks\nStill having big straps\nPhone tap running laps cross the map hot trap\n50,000 on craps\nPlug got that baby powder\nThese niggas out here sour\n80k perform for an hour\nShould of played for the Dolphins\nShould of played for the Saints\nNigga saying it's a drought\nTakeoff still having pints\nStill playing with that oil\nStill playing with that dope\nMight catch me on the nawf\nStill chopping it up with Bo\nI got bitches out in Florida\nHaving bitches out in Georgia\nNew bitch hit my phone said she wanna give me dome\nCutting dope by Georgia dome\nHigh school, no diploma\nRemember days on the nawf\nNow I'm quarterback a coach\nBetter watch your approach when you pull up on the 'chos\nYeah my niggas having sticks\nMama didn't raise a bitch\nNow your bitch always call my phone for motherfucking snow\nToday I just met the plug put him in the figure four (coca)\nOld Quavo might just pull up and just kick a door nigga\nFree my nigga Westside got 5 to the dope nigga\nFree my nigga Kobe got 15 to the net (money)\nNow I got some hired shooters with the coolants on the TECs\nI don't mean no disrespect but I came for the checks (yea)\nThey free'd the savage Set\nConcerts in Quebec\nPut her on the grits\nYoung nigga hitting them licks\nNo Label 3\nIndependent signed for bricks\n\n[Verse 2: Offset]\n(huh-huh) Jumped off the porch porch\n(huh-huh) Picked up the fork\n(huh-huh) Stay with the torch (baow, graow)\n(huh) We did this shit from the Nawf (Nawf)\n(huh) Niggas be thinkin I'm actin' tough (actin' up)\nI'm with the shit I don't give a fuck\nSlaughter your daughter get passed to my partner we fuck her then call up an Uber truck (uh)\nFuck it up (fuck it up)\nFuck it up (fuck it up)\nGetting that pot do an uppercut (uh)\nGet in that pussy like cootie cutters (oh)\nGet you some money then live it up (cash)\nPull out that stick he start hiccing up (huh)\nYou see the ski start bitching up (bitch)\nStand on the stage and pipe it up (pipe it up)\nFucking your hoe while you wife her up (aye)\nI got the birds like Mighty Duck (brrr)\nSwerve on the curb in the Bentley truck (skrt)\nFuck what you talking we pulling up (fuck it)\nYour face on the ground nigga pick it up (pick it up)\nNo Label (huh-huh)\nNo Label (huh-huh)\nNo Label (nah)\nI'm getting my own paper (cash)\nI get your bitch and slay her (raow)\nI'm the president I'm not the mayor (huh)\nDiamonds got my body cold I got em' bout four layers\nI need a bitch that look like Draya\nCatching bricks off in the mail (brick)\nNudie jeans\nIce creams from Pharrell\nI'm a player (player)\n\n[Verse 3: Takeoff]\nCame in the game (aye)\nKnock at the door\nNobody answered had to do a kick door (boom)\nMy niggas they on the same shit (same)\nHad to tell em' what that bando was for\nI know that we not from Atlanta nigga what you think them two fingers and thumb for (Nawf)\nAnd they been hating on me since I was a lil' boy tell me something I don't know (know)\nIt's been a long road (long)\nI put in work but no cheat code (no)\nPen on paper like kinko\nNever look back and won't sell my soul (never look back)\nReal niggas never fold (naw)\nSay you a hundred but you told (huh)\nIt's hot outside it ain't cold\nNigga seen the Draco and froze (pussy)\nNigga acting bold I'm a fuck around and wipe the pussy nigga nose (wipe)\nStrip a nigga out his clothes (strip)\nDon't like it then pay what you owe\nBigger backend at the shows (backend)\nSpanish for Telemundo (spanish flow)\nI got the Act in the bag right now (Act')\nBut I won't send you a four (nah)\nDope dressed up in saran it look like the pope (pope)\nAnd get smoked from the gas bags it'll make you choke\nIf you pour up, smoke or snort coke\nThat what float your boat (boat)\nThis No Label not uno not dos\nCome from the goats\n(Takeoff!)"}}, {"title": "WOA", "album": "Young Rich Niggas 2", "year": "2016-01-18", "lyrics": "[Intro: Takeoff]\nWoah, woah\nDun Deal on the track\n\n[Chorus: Takeoff]\nBig

in that Aston Martin\nHurricane wrist, watch Young Quavo break the pot\nIn the VIP shootin\u2019 nothing but money jump shots\nCan't nobody touch me cause my goons like secret service\nPull up, pop the trunk, it's a flock of birdies\nSmokin' on purp James Worthy, (purp)\nSippin' on pink like Kirby, (lean)\nI already know she thirsty\nSo I put her in the kitchen dancing dirty\nI already know he a coward, I already know he sour\nHe a snake in the grass so I had to cut him off\nI call that Georgia Power\nWe don\u2019t even kick it like that dog\nQuick to spray a nigga like Lysol\nDon't get mad at me cause I smashed your bitch\nThen I passed her like Chris Paul\nHell nah I don\u2019t need no label\nHundred bands just sitting on the table\nFace card so good in da hood\nI could go kick shit

fierce\nI done shot more jumpers than that Paul Pierce\nOr Kevin Garnett, 'cept I don\u2019t even break a sweat\nI\u2019m flying learjet, all-glass clear jet\nMe and Migos stackin' C-Notes, DJ

cash, nigga no issue\nThey like T-James! That's my nigga!\nYou a real nigga bruh thats why we fuck with ya\nMy reply is always humble nigga never brag\nTell that cute bitch, \"Show me where them 'levens at!\"\nYou want them Jordans,

slow your roll jabroni\nRun up on the block they shoot some\nWalking around with that that tommy gun\nYoung niggas in the hood love the molly santan\nWhen they pop it , they'll chew it like some bubble gum\nCan't fuck with the plug , that nigga be taxin\nSo I had to make a mission like the famous Jett Jackson\nGot all these pocket rockets on my body\nLookin like a young nigga got go go gadgets\nLook at yo bitch n' she ratchet\nStill beat the pot up like Cassius\nMake the work disappear like magic\nHit the plug in China town, order up another package\n\n[Bridge: Rich Homie Quan]\nOk

movies\nYou smoking on that boatweed and we smoking on them cookies\nWoke up in a mansion, but I went to sleep in them trenches\nStarted off in them Honda Accords now Im riding in them Bentleys\nYo bitch fuck with a young nigga, Im dunking her like Timothy\nThem bullets just like Ritalin, make a nigga calm down instantly\n\n[Verse 3: Takeoff]\nAsk yo mama! Ask yo bitch!\nI grab the fork and I cook up a brick\nI grab the pint and I pour up 6 (I\u2019m pouring it!)\nActavis, I don\u2019t do Qualitest (Lean)\nLettuce and cabbage and broccoli (Cash!)\nI\u2019m cooking up catfish, tilapia, (fishes!), and I got flounders\nGot yo bitch fucking on camera (Smash!)\nHell nah we don\u2019t fuck wit no phonies\nAnd you can tell yo bitch we some young rich homies (yo bitch!!)\nJust left my jeweler, so much ice on my neck got pneumonia\nGuisepppe stepper, Christian Lubuiton\u2019s, and Maison Margiela\n(The stove hot the block hot middle of the summer wearing leather!)\n\n[Hook: Quavo]\nChasing the cheese macaroni\nKeep the pocket rocket on me\nHell naw we don't fuck with no phonies\nYou can tell yo' bitch we some young rich

time when double talked to me\nTold me y'all the hottest niggas in the street\nHe told me bout the dirty world and fucked up industry\nThese niggas they don't love you and they want you for your currency\nSo I go buy a pint of lean\nI'm thinking bout moving to Canada but I know they 'gon be still watching me\nI know that they're after me, but I won't let them capture me\nAnd everyday, and every night, I pray they won't shackle me!\n\n[Chorus: Takeoff]\nTwo cups filled up with easter pink\nTake a minute, rest in peace, to PIMP C\nDouble G, Louis V all over me\nTake a minute, rest in

only four\nDamn! now I gotta pour a four\nGot my momma on my back, she really love me though\nTaking all this pressure so I had to pull a kick door\nI understand I have committed a sin\nDouble Dee said keep going hard on these fuck niggas, gotta know we 'gon win\nSo I'm sitting in my room reading the Bible\nSkip wiping down a dirty rifle\nNever know when it's your last supper nigga, so you gotta keep you some disciples, gone!\n\n[Chorus: Takeoff]\nTwo cups filled up with easter pink\nTake a minute, rest in peace, to PIMP C\nDouble G, Louis V all over me\nTake a minute, rest in peace, OG

When a nigga hit the plug\nWhen I nigga hit the trap and I hit 'em with the pump\nLook at the pot, look at the egg beater, hit 'em with the uh (skrrt)\nHit 'em with it, hit 'em with it\nHit 'em with

with it\nYou niggas in your own lane, Migo gang in a division\nHit the pot just for the extras, abracadabra it\u2019s missing\nHit the pot, hit it, hit it, hit it, make 'em take that like Diddy\nFuck fuck nigga talking, pull up on the block with extensions\nLook up the statistics, I\u2019m worth a million\nI might pull up in the coupe and hurt your feelings\nIf you shooting at a nigga, better hit him\n'Cause you never know, he could come back and hit you\n\n[Chorus: Quavo]\nYour bitch look like she want to fuck some\nThat\u2019s what I did when I came in the room and I hit her with the uh (Hit

her\nBullets hit the Sprinter, you sweeter than a cinnamon\nI\u2019m checking my agenda, you niggas acting feminine\nHad enough to pay my dividends, Migos I\u2019m a citizen\nIt was evident we had to stay passionate\nPissing diamonds accident, my money is immaculate\nHit 'em with the tackle\nPull out the chopper, not fronting I\u2019ll rush 'em\nSipping on Actavis in my blood vessel\nI am not a mason but I\u2019m rocking Margiella\u2019s\nHigher than a motherfucker, just like a propeller\nI\u2019m riding in the Mulsanne, Bentley got umbrellas\nMy plug\u2019s too far so I tell a nigga mail 'em\n\n[Chorus]\nYour bitch look like she want to fuck some\nThat\u2019s what I did when I came in the room and I hit her with the uh (Hit it!)\nWhen a nigga hit the plug\nWhen a nigga hit the trap

hit!)\n\n[Verse 3: Takeoff]\nNigga talking crazy like he want to buck\nHit him with the uppercut, I make him knuckle up\nPull up in the Lamborghini Murcielago to\nMake your bitch buckle up, turn me up\nSipping on poison ivy, but nigga check my double cup\nMy brothers know Isley, tweety bird tweeting in my Bentley truck\nNigga talking bout a check then Imma run it up\nShots fired at my sprinter bus, bap bap bap, graow\nNobody got hit, it was ten of us\nTouch down at Coachella and they pulling up\nPick up the vector, then I point it up\nStart busting, ain\u2019t no need to load it\nI hit the gas, take out their expedition truck\n\n[Chorus: Quavo]\nYour bitch look like she want to fuck some\nThat\u2019s what I did when I came in the room and I hit her with the uh (Hit it!)\nWhen a nigga hit the plug\nWhen a nigga hit the trap and I hit 'em with the pump\nLook at the pot, look at the egg beater, hit 'em with the uh\nHit 'em with it, hit 'em with it\nHit 'em with it, hit 'em with it,

16\nI don\u2019t know\n\n[Verse 1: Quavo]\nYou take the deuce of that yellow then drink it\nI be like, \u201cDamn, boy!\u201d what is you thinking?\nWhen I hit Henn' bitch fuck it, I\u2019m swinging\nWalk in the Nawf, you know that they banging\n(You know I got to pull up on the Nawfside one time)\nDope boy mentality, dope boy mentality\nWalk in the kitchen, I make a fatality (finish him)\nI feel like Takeoff, yeah we moving to Canada\nCause I still feel like people be after us (12!)\nI got the chopper don\u2019t challenge us\nWhite girl, she geeked off of angel dust\nBoy you sugar and spice, like a Powerpuff\nShoot a nigga like a catapult\nYou tell me you broke; I don\u2019t give a fuck\nI fuck her one time and I\u2019m sick of her\nPerform at the Fox, no Vivica\nGet that pack out the box on the Reebok\nWhen you get the dope and it\u2019s recooked\nYou talking about something that he took\nThe first time you shot, it was off a little bit\nThen you came back and got rebooked\nTwenty-four karat, all gold on my neck, you think I got it from Egypt\nIf dabbing go for a contagious disease, you think that shit was the measles\nEverything foreign, everything foreign, came a long way from that regal\nI got the birds, like an eagle\nTraded away, that\u2019s a Michael Vick eagle\nYou just worry about yours\nI\u2019ma just worry about mine\nShout out to my nigga, Jerz\nWe used to trap nicks and dimes\nI don\u2019t drink, but I still buy pints\nHundred thousand cash make your hoe faint\nDrugs and money is something we talk about all the time, but you can relate\nDon\u2019t imitate, the dab I create\nI\u2019m in YRN clothing or in Bathing Ape\nNiggas be saving up for a lifetime just to\nGet a new rollie and go out and skate\nBillionaire looking my way I\u2019m on pace\nFeeling like Donald Trump back in the day\nDon\u2019t beef with no rapper it\u2019s a money race\nIt won\u2019t be an issue if you come in first place\nGive it to him in the worst way\nFinesse the plug with a fade away\nI bought my diamonds from a Blu-Ray\nI bought Versace shades from Ray (Ray Charles!)\nPut a \u2018tato on the K\nIt gon\u2019 be loud anyway\nThe Migos life, you think, a maze\nBut really, my nigga, we straight\n(We straight!)\n\n[Verse 2: Takeoff]\nTakeoff!\nNigga we straight, no one down to debate\nAt the round table steak and a stack on my plate\nI stack and pray and I stay out the way\nIt\u2019s a good day today, I\u2019ma pour me an eight\nGrab the act out the refrigerate\nCall up the plug, see what we gonna do today\nHundred-round on me, don\u2019t speak or say \u201cHey\u201d\nNigga look in my way, you get shot in the face\nDab when I jump out the Wraith\nWhen you talk on the telephone, watch what you say\nThey gave them one hundred and they closed the case\nGot off the road, I threw half a mill in my safe\nTransactions on trap phone, so it ain\u2019t no trace\nDon\u2019t come out the house, you can\u2019t make it back safe\nWalk in with a knot; you know I\u2019m cashing out\nUsed to tell them folks \u201cPut your shit on layaway,\u201d\nWhen it\u2019s the summer, the spring, or the fall, or the winter, my niggas they having pistols\nYou pushing that rental, my niggas pull up on you with them\nDon\u2019t say nothing, Domingo gone get \u2018em\nAfter you get \u2018em, Domingo gon\u2019 split \u2018em\nCan\u2019t let these niggas fuck up my momentum\nThese bitches is snake, trying to feed me that venom\nI trap out the bando; the boards come on the windows\nI remember, I can\u2019t afford a fender bender\nNow I\u2019m fucking bitches and I\u2019m Malcolm in the Middle\nI see you toting that pistol, but you ain\u2019t gonna shoot it with \u2018em\nWhat the fuck is you doing, nigga, you might as well kill him\nNiggas rapping and stealing the flow, but nigga I invented it\nYou bitch want some boot, and I ain\u2019t talking about Timberland\nThese bitches gold diggers, ain\u2019t gon\u2019 give \u2018em

N.W.A nigga\n\n[Verse 1: Quavo]\nWoke up quick at about noon, just thought that I had to be on the north soon\nHop in my Beamer to see my moms, my mom started trippin' 'bout my stinkin ass bong\nStopped at the gas station, get it pumped by the bums\nSee some niggas that ain't like where I came from\nI grabbed my Glock then I dialed one number\nTell my brother that I'm slipping and I'm in trouble\nSo the nigga I don't like made a move to the right\nI grabbed the Glock and point it at him on sight\nThe nigga to the left told me put the gun down\nBOW one round, Uh, its going down\nI ran out the store, I can't believe I ain't hit\nMy migos pull up with macs and sticks\nRel hopped out and let 2 shots off\nThen I looked around the corner it's Gwinnett County law\nI rolled down the window, it's the officer\nPut his nose in my car, he say he smell the herb\nHe opened up the door and asked me can he search?\nHell Naw, officer you know how much I'm worth?\nI'm worth a million\n\n[Hook: Quavo]\nHigh speed chase, going down 85\nBlue and white lights on the north side\nHigh speed chase, going down 85\nYoung nigga ain't trying to see no jail time\nHigh speed chase,

line sayin' I'm on Fox 5\nI said \"you sure Ma?\" she said \"baby it's live\"\nI said \"Fuck twelve\" turn up the alpine\nRockin' down Boggs Road seen a punk ass busta\nGot the 38 on me but this bitch kinda rusty\nFuck it i'ma shoot it, if its jammed then I'm running\nBOW BOW BOW BOW, crumping must be from Oakland\nI ran through the cut, 12 chasin' me\nSmoking on gas got the best of me\nHe getting so close, bout to tackle me\nI turned around and emptied the clip, get from round me\nIt's fucked up, niggas in the hood they killing each other\nAnd most of us got single parents, only a mother\nNiggas in the kitchen whipping chickens, tryna get butter\nPolice on my ass cause the Budniks on the Cutlass\nPolice pull me over got the mac in the back\nWait till he get up out the car and hit the gas\nHigh speed chase down 29\nAnd if I get caught I'm gettin' a lifetime\n\n[Hook: Quavo]\nHigh speed chase, going down 85\nBlue and white lights on the north side\nHigh speed chase, going

quick at about noon, just thought that I had to be on the north soon\nHop in my Beamer to see my moms, my mom started trippin' 'bout my stinkin ass bong\nStopped at the gas station, get it pumped by the bums\nSee some niggas that ain't like where I came from\nI grabbed my Glock then I dialed one number\nTell my brother that I'm slipping and I'm in trouble\nSo the nigga I don't like made a move to the right\nI grabbed the Glock and point it at him on sight\nThe nigga to the left told me put the gun down\nBOW one round, Uh, its going down\nI ran out the store, I can't believe I ain't hit\nMy migos pull up with macs and sticks\nRel hopped out and let 2 shots off\nThen I looked around the corner it's Gwinnett County law\nI rolled down the window, it's the officer\nPut his nose in my car, he say he smell the herb\nHe opened up the door and asked me can he search?\nHell Naw, officer you know how much I'm worth?\nI'm worth a million\n\n[Hook: Quavo]\nHigh speed chase, going down 85\nBlue and white lights on the north side\nHigh speed chase, going down 85\nYoung nigga ain't trying to see no jail time\nHigh speed chase, going down 85\nBlue and white lights on the north side\nHigh speed chase, going down 85\nYoung nigga ain't trying to see no jail time\n\n[Verse 2: Offset]\nHigh Speed chase going down 29\nMama on my line sayin' I'm on Fox 5\nI said \"you sure Ma?\" she said \"baby it's live\"\nI said \"Fuck twelve\" turn up the alpine\nRockin' down Boggs Road seen a punk ass busta\nGot the 38 on me but this bitch kinda rusty\nFuck it i'ma shoot it, if its jammed then I'm running\nBOW BOW BOW BOW, crumping must be from Oakland\nI ran through the cut, 12 chasin' me\nSmoking on gas got the best of me\nHe getting so close, bout to tackle me\nI turned around and emptied the clip, get from round me\nIt's fucked up, niggas in the hood they killing each other\nAnd most of us got single parents, only a mother\nNiggas in the kitchen whipping chickens, tryna get butter\nPolice on my ass cause the Budniks on the Cutlass\nPolice pull me over got the mac in the back\nWait till he get up out the car and hit the gas\nHigh speed chase down 29\nAnd if I get caught I'm gettin' a lifetime\n\n[Hook: Quavo]\nHigh speed chase, going down 85\nBlue and white lights on the north side\nHigh speed chase, going down 85\nYoung nigga ain't trying to see no jail time\nHigh speed chase, going down 85\nBlue and white lights on the north side\nHigh speed chase, going down 85\nYoung nigga ain't trying to see no jail time\n\n\n[Verse 3: Takeoff]\nOnce upon a time not long ago\n3 amigos by the name of Offset Takeoff Quavo\nStayed on the north side, thats where anything goes\nAnd if a nigga disrespect, he meet the funeral home\nWake up in the morning, thank him cause it's me that he chose\nMigo Jerz at the bando with a fork in a bowl\nMy nigga called me at the park and said its getting too deep\nJumped in my R8 with ostrich seats and hit the streets\nRidin' down club drive feeling myself\nI know the block is hot, I'm screaming fuck 12 sparking a spliff\nMy conscious telling me you tripping Takeoff think I see 12\nDamn I shouldn't of served that nigga at the Shell\nNow lemme tell you a riddle\nMirror mirror on the wall, what would you do if police told you pull over your car?\nMirror, when do you picture the Migos falling off?\nThe mirror said you stupid boy, don't ask that question at all\nI see red and white blue lights as I look in my rear\nPut the gas out, it's Friday and it's smokey in here\nFuck another high speed chase, that's when the hemi kick in\nForgive me for my sins, I ain't going back to the pen\nIt's gon be a...\n\n[Hook: Quavo]\nHigh speed chase, going down 85\nBlue and white lights on the north side\nHigh speed chase, going

your block, (Shot right up your block)\nEvery time I pull up the LIV, I'm in a half a million dollar car (Skrt skrt skrt)\nKick rocks, nigga, get away from my boys (kick rocks nigga)\nI'm bleedin' red, man I'm bleedin' bad\nShawty winnin', ballin' out\nTake a molly then I stall out\nShe tried to put my dogs in her dog house\nWhen they smell fear you know they poppin' off\nI'ma go and fuck your daughter study law\nI'ma stand for what I believe till I fall\nIf I never said it, I'm sayin' it right now\nSay what you want I'ma shed my pride now\nEverybody say fuck the feds and five-o\nGave everybody theirs it\u2019s mine now\nI'ma make a public announcement, call now\nTurn to a blood, them A's went down now\nKinda good lookin', them bitches fine now\nI'ma drip some red on the sauna\nI'ma cop the bread when it's all gone\nI get a machete on for you\nSleepin' on that bitch like I'm comfortable\n\n[Hook: Quavo]\nWhen I take drugs I go to the moon\nLil' spoiled bitch, 2000 on shoes\nWalk in the club with one bitch, leave with two\nBy myself at the top like cocoon\nWhen I'm in the coupe I feel like a cocoon\nDesigner gifts red bottoms baboon\nWe the wave, we the wave, typhoon\nTake her out of the hills to fuck with some goons\nNow she breaking pounds in my room\n\n[Verse 2: Quavo]\nI put the fours on em\nCame from juggin' with bowl homie\nNow look all this rose gold, gold yellow gold, gold, gold on me\nYeah mob ties frog eyes\nWhat a time to be alive\nNo neighbors\nHouse on the hill with the acres\nDon't date her\nRunning through the squad slave her\nI'm the mayor\nPresident Huncho a player\nTwin chopper Sonic and Tails\nTwin chopper Sonic and Tails\nNiggas love when the birds sing\nWhite cocaine Pinky and the Brain\nLove when the box hit the mail\nI love when the player wanna bail\nI hate when a nigga want problems\nBut I love to give a nigga shells\nGod protect me from the evil\nTake the squad out the cheetahs\nStreets crawling like beetles\nBut the Stanley Steamer keep me cleaner\nYou got it out the mud I got it out the oil\nYou heard the cash prince niggas on Forbes\nI'm the plug, extension cord\nGot your favorite model on drugs If you ain't know it\n\n[Hook: Quavo]\nWhen I take drugs I go to the moon\nLil' spoiled bitch, 2000 on shoes\nWalk in the club with one bitch, leave with two\nBy myself at the top like cocoon\nWhen I'm in the

Offset]\nAy, I ain't tryna save 'em\nMomma said don't let em' no where you lay at\nOld bitches back in the day use to play bad\nI'm a pull up flexing in the Maybach\nNorthside nigga but we bought the A back\nI'm a beat the motherfucker make his face flat\nHit it from the back back baby throw it back\nHave a heart attack, can you handle that?\nMaison Margiela dabbin' on everybody\nI'm on the codeine moving like a dead body\nBad bitch went to college but she real thotty\nThat's the reason I can't even trust nobody\nCeline and supreme I'm the dab daddy\nShe coming home with me when she mad at ya'\nSucking on me buckling my knees throw a bag at ya'\nMolly feel like Hercules when a nigga jab at ya'\nHold on wait, Hopping in the Wraith\nStars in the ceiling like I'm living out of space\nManoeuvre like a boss we don't ever leave a trace\nDirty Diana the chopper keep a nigga safe\nFucking a model bitches big booty little waist\nI'm putting the money over these bitches any day\nThis one for the people that taking drugs everyday\nFuck what they say let the pain go away\n\n[Hook: Quavo]\nWhen I take drugs I go to the moon\nLil' spoiled bitch, 2000 on shoes\nWalk in the club with one bitch, leave with two\nBy myself at the top like cocoon\nWhen I'm in the coupe I feel like a cocoon\nDesigner gifts red bottoms baboon\nWe the wave we the wave typhoon\nTake her out of the hills to fuck with some goons\nNow she breaking pounds in my room\n\n[Verse 4: Takeoff]\nPinky codeine and mushrooms\nSweep a nigga like I was a broom\nI be going up like a balloon\nChop a nigga with the bamboo in Cancun\n20 bitches runnin' 'round nude\nI fuck her bottom we fuckin' them by the two\nI got water drippin' out my jewels\nIf it ain't Actavis nigga it ain't approved\nMigo the gang we will never lose\nSo many bitches might catch me on Shade room\nGot a Pit bull thinking 'bout copping a Baboon\nFree all my niggas like a movie they coming soon\nWhen I'm in the coupe I feel like I'm in a cacoon\nTen bitches ready up at the Boom Boom Room\nActin' a John but I ain't Tune\nTakeoff!\n\n[Hook: Quavo]\nWhen I take drugs I go to the moon\nLil' spoiled bitch, 2000 on shoes\nWalk in the club with one bitch, leave with two\nBy myself at the top like cocoon\nWhen I'm in the coupe I feel like a cocoon\nDesigner gifts red bottoms baboon\nWe the wave we the wave typhoon\nTake her out of the hills to fuck with some goons\nNow she breaking pounds in my room"}}, {"title": "No Label 2 (Intro)", "album": "No Label II", "year": "2014-02-25", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nMigos!\nTalk to em

blow in the wind\nFinesse the plug, I don\u2019t need a Benjamin\nJudge out of trial so you know I'm innocent\nSmoking on gas blunts longer than incense\n\n[Hook: Quavo]\nFinesser, finesser\nFinesser,

Finesse, Steal\nI gotta have a mil\nI was raised on the hill like Jack and the Jill\nDo anything just to pay them bills\nMy brother caught 15 waiting for the pill\nWhen a nigga broke, he coming at your throat\nTryna' sell the coke but it really is soap\nMy lil' nigga Shad got smoked\nHungry for the money, trying to get the dough\nShit get real, nigga tried to kill\nAll this bullshit for a dollar bill\nHoes set you up, they don\u2019t give a fuck\nTryna' get ya bucks, watch who you fuck\nPlug\u2019s like a socket, gotta keep the rocket\nTryna get a profit, running to that money like Sonic\nAll my cars robotic\nNo Master P, but \"I'm Bout It\" gone\n\n[Hook: Quavo]\nFinesser, finesser\nFinesser, finesser\nThis is my life, (my life, my life)\nThis is my life\nFinesser, finesser\nFinesser, finesser\nThis is my life\nThis is my life (finesse, finesse, finesse)\n\n[Verse 3: Takeoff]\nFinessing and flexing like Wrestlers\nIndian plug in that castle\nBald headed Jag, got cancer\nTurn your main bitch to a dirty dancer\nI\u2019m cooking and wrapping them chickens\nFinessing these niggas on tickets\nIf I fuck with ya, I\u2019mma give you a straight drop\nIf its anotha' nigga I gotta remix it\nFlipping them patties like Krabby's\nMy shoes is Prada's or Bally's\nFinessing since I can remember\nMy wrist so cold, December\nI\u2019m selling T-bones, they tender\nThat steel wrapped around me like Bender\nDifference between me and you\nI'm real and you a pretender\n\n[Hook: Quavo]\nFinesser, finesser\nFinesser, finesser\nThis is my life, (my life, my life)\nThis is

laughing\nNow my palm itching\nNow my palms itching\nCame from bomb pitching\nMy mama be the witness\nFree my convicts\nThat took a long sentence\nAll my niggas came from the north, they born

fill a Backwood, the cookies it came from the Bay\nBitch, I came from the trap\nTake her phone, she wanna snap\nI don\u2019t get no sleep, I just take naps\nI look out the peep, 12 at the trap\nI look

past\nNow we through playing, we playing with cash\nDroppin my top just to dump out the ash\nWrestle with work like my name Kevin Nash\nLet me take it back just for two minutes\nFourteens and the

envy me\nBehind the lot shootin\u2019 at my enemies\nQuavo got Kylie, well I got that Kimberly\nDrinking codeine, moving slow like a centipede\nWe brought that flow back when niggas didn\u2019t know\nPeople compare Migos to Bone Thugs-n-Harmony\nI put my blood sweat and tears in the game\nAnd I still got more years so I bet they\u2019ll remember me\nAll of these niggas they trying to rap nowadays\nWhen I start spitting I ball cause it\u2019s inner me\nRemember taking trips in the Infinity\nLooking for gold, electronics, or Benjamin\u2019s\n(hot, hot), the block is sizzling\nGotta stay

they got this shit from\nCame in the game kicking doors, fucking hoes, and rocking gold (Don't act like you don't know that shit nigga)\nNow our pockets swoled (big racks)\nBeen having hoes (havin')\nBeen having niggas on go (havin')\nFor real (woop)\nAsk about it\n\n[Verse 1: Quavo]\nI\u2019ma put on for my city (North)\nYou gon\u2019 put on for these bitches\nYoung nigga I came from nothing\nAnd now I\u2019m at parties with Diddy\nSee at first they didn\u2019t believe me\nNow this shit coming way too easy\nI\u2019m with a paid assassin\nRun to the money, we dashing (go get it)\nWe the ones came up with dabbing\nWe put \u2018em on trap fashion\nI made a play out in Athens\nI\u2019m whipping up Kylie Kardashian\nSame niggas see me having\nUsed to be the same niggas laughing\nNow my palm itching\nNow my palms itching\nCame from bomb pitching\nMy mama be the witness\nFree my convicts\nThat took a long sentence\nAll my niggas came from the north, they born menace\nAy, ay, no Kanye\nI walk in the trap, play with yay\nBao, bao, bao, ra-ra-rao watch what you mu\u2019fuckers say (shhh)\nCall up the lean, pour an eight\nThen pop an eight, tray tray\nThen I fill a Backwood, the cookies it came from the Bay\nBitch, I came from the trap\nTake her phone, she wanna snap\nI don\u2019t get no sleep, I just take naps\nI look out the peep, 12 at the trap\nI look out my peep, 12 at the trap\nAy, my nigga gon\u2019 run with that sack\nAy, my nigga gon\u2019 flush that lil pack\nI jump out the window then forty yard dash\nThat\u2019s the shit I used to do in the past\nNow we through playing, we playing with cash\nDroppin my top just to dump out the ash\nWrestle with work like my name Kevin Nash\nLet me take it back just for two minutes\nFourteens and the nines, had tools in it\nAnd you notice that it didn\u2019t have windows\nThat the first fucking million dollar bando\n\n[Verse 2: Takeoff]\nSome niggas came in the game dancing but Migos you know we came in with the fashion\nAin\u2019t talking \u2018bout Donatella but we the most underrated rappers reppin\u2019 and havin\u2019\nMy niggas have a 30 plus a 30 in the vicinity literally (so that\u2019s a 60)\nI would give you names of these Migos clones but it\u2019s every rapper in the industry (literally)\nAnd they wanna know why we pressing these niggas, they don\u2019t let us in they facility\nCause if you ask me I feel like I should get a percentage the way they be stealing me\nElmo, these niggas they tickle me\nDrink codeine and trap out the embassy\nMama said niggas\u2019ll envy me\nBehind the lot shootin\u2019 at my enemies\nQuavo got Kylie, well I got that Kimberly\nDrinking codeine, moving slow like a centipede\nWe brought that flow back when niggas didn\u2019t know\nPeople compare Migos to Bone Thugs-n-Harmony\nI put my blood sweat and tears in the game\nAnd I still got more years so I bet they\u2019ll remember me\nAll of these niggas they trying to rap nowadays\nWhen I start spitting I ball cause it\u2019s inner me\nRemember taking trips in the Infinity\nLooking for gold, electronics, or Benjamin\u2019s\n(hot, hot), the block is sizzling\nGotta stay low key cause witnesses snitching\nWho the fuck told \u2018em north side wasn\u2019t the trenches?\nThese niggas bitches, they want some attention\nNiggas get put in detention\nIt ain\u2019t my fault, nigga, it\u2019s your decision\nNo presents up under your christmas tree\nCause I am the Grinch, stole christmas\nWonder why your children not watching Disney\nCause Migos we making a history\nI bought twenty pints of Activis\nYou think I\u2019m sellin\u2019 em, but that\u2019s just for me to sip it\nIf you don\u2019t believe me you can ask Quavo, matter fact Offset was right there with me\n\n[Verse 3: Offset]\nOffset!!\nHistory repeat itself, I got locked up again\nI came home to the Benjamin\u2019s\nAs a young nigga they always envied me\nYou copy my dab, you lil niggas are mini-me\u2019s\nMy necklace it cost me a brick a piece\nFuck the bitch so good I make the bitch\u2019 knees weak\nDropped the top off the Bentley, it\u2019s up to me\nI sat on a milly while I was in custody\nPicked up my stick, hundred rounds in my clip\nDouble cup of Actavis, I pour a couple zips\nI\u2019m that same nigga that jumped in the VIP\nLot of niggas pussy \u2018cause they know that I\u2019m a killer\nMade a couple million, but the bricks up in the rental\nWe was in the bando, trapping, capping, I remember\nI really beat the nigga, caught a pussy nigga stealing\nGet hit with that stick and I bet you gon\u2019 feel it\nPull up in Maseratis, where my ceiling\nI see a nigga plotting, where my semi\nI can whip me up a brick in a minute\nThrow on Margiela one day, then Givenchy\nGot the game in submission, your bitch in my kitchen\nDon\u2019t care \u2018bout no ho cause that money my mission\nChill Will want a body, his finger been itching\nAnd my Ferrari got bricks

plea, I said fuck it, I did it\nYRN 2, nigga listen up, hear it\nWe back on our shit, you can\u2019t fuck with us period\nI see a million when I\u2019m in the mirror\nGet hit with the Glock and I scrape off the serial\nHop in the Lamb, hit the gas, hit the gear\nI got a shooter with me, he right here\nI got your bitch suck my dick, on my Lear\nPolice be watching me like a premiere\nPut that

I made three mil this month\nYou wanna talk keys? The white with the black wrap looking like nuns\nYou wanna talk thieves? One side got it coming in, none\n\n[Chorus: Quavo]\nFuck it, crown the kings\nWe're living the dream\nCrown the kings\nLiving the dream\n\n[Refrain: Quavo]\nNigga look like we'll, nigga look like

Offset]\nDrown the ice with medicine\nDrown your bitch with the skeleton\nI'm on the stove cooking elements\nThe skies the limit, I'm heaven-sent\nDripping the flies, a pelican\nBuy me a zoo, I got elephants\nThey salty, these niggas not relevant\nThey copy the bros and it's evident\nRiding in the red Wraith, row your boat\nMy soul devoted\nBank rolls are loaded\nCash out, no notice\nRolls Royce came with a chauffeur\nStick in the couch and the sofa\nFive Karat in my ear, it's a boulder\nPass me the fire, smoke 'em\nMe and my bitch are like B and Hova\nGo do a show in the 'Sota\nStash the 100's they mowed up\nFuck on your bitch 'til she throw up\nStick to the code, don't fold up\nBoujee bitch, her nose up\nSmashing the thot, do I toe-tap\nHundred round drums, cold cuts\n\n[Chorus: Quavo]\nFuck it, crown the kings\nWe're living the dream\nCrown the kings\nLiving the dream\n\n[Refrain: Quavo]\nNigga look like we'll, nigga look like we'll shoot at 'em\nNiggas look like we'll sponsor the dope and you sell 'em\nNigga look like you'd snitch on a nigga, yeah, you tell 'em\nNigga might think we UPS the way we mail 'em\n\n[Verse 3: Takeoff]\nI got every drug that start with a letter\nChickens is tender\nWith her she said I'm \"like Souja Boy the way you tell em\"\nBreakin' and enter\nFree all my nigga locked up in the cell, no cellular\nI'm special, but first I was regular\nFuck the feds and free my niggas that\u2019s federal\nCouple scammers and some decimals\nI'ma feed 'em to the animals\nI let 'em play in the back with them lions\n'Til he run out of the stamina\nI told him \"he stealing\" he told me I'm lying\nI told him I got him on camera\nAct like I wanna make music with ya\nJust to hit you and your manager\n\n[Outro: Quavo]\nFuck it, crown the kings\nCrown the kings\nFuck it, crown the kings"}}, {"title": "FEMA", "album": "Young Rich Niggas", "year": "2013-06-13", "lyrics": "[Intro: Quavo]\nYuh, yuh, Migo, Migo, Migo, Migo\nZay, Zay, Zay,

playin' Madden and I ain't playin' sticks)\nI'm a rich nigga, you can check my status (You can check my status, you can check the stats)\nPass chemistry, fuck mathmatics (Fuck mathmatics, I ain't pass school)\nMy money counter do the adding (Money counter do the rules)\nI bought a carpet from Aladdin (I bought a carpet from Aladdin)\nSo I can finesse and do magic (So I can fly and finesse,

while my pockets filled\nWe don't spare no nigga, cut his head off and show me his real\nWe got diamonds and gold, ain't no stainless steel\nIndependant, we didn't take a deal\nI know you heard about the fight, I know you heard about the shooting, I know you heard a nigga ruthless\nThirty thousand for a viewing\nBitch you see the dab\n10 pairs Margielas, you do the math\nWhen I pull up on Beverly shopping, I pull up in a Phantom, not in a cab\nRed bottom drippin' it's a blood bath\nFerragamo, arrested for my dab\nSay I'm the dab daddy with my dabbin' ass\nFuck your bitch one time I give her

Dab! On top of dab\nTakeoff in the kitchen like I'm Dexter's Lab\nWalk in the mall and I dip in Ge'\nSwappin', no swappin', no check the tag\nDab daddy so the bitches wanna take selfies\nDicking it up, never not fuck they momma, they call me Melvin\nYoung rich nigga but they know that we handsome and wealthy\nTakeoff is spillin' Actavis on new Margielas\nEverywhere I go they call me dab daddy\nDab daddy, got the different, different dab\nFlippin' dab like a acrobat\nFlippin' it, flippin' it, flippin' 'em\n2500 my typa drink, I got expensive habits (Actavis, Actavis, Actavis)\nThrow body parts

circumcise 'em\nThen I hit the pot with the pile driver\n\n[Hook 2] x2\n\n[Verse 3: Takeoff]\nYoung Rich Nigga, I call the plug, I'm finessing\nI'm strapped up with the smith and wesson, I'm taking yo blessings\nSmoking a Michael Vick 7, preach to these niggas like reverends\nNo Jason and Freddy, I keep the Machete\nI'm taking a trip to Quebec to go pick up that check\nNigga no UPS but he mail it, right that bitch up and I scale it\nStand on the block and i sale it, selling more dope than them niggas in Belly\nThe niggas after me, I'm makaveli\nShe popping the molly, she rollin' like kelly, she sweating\nShe can't stop touching and talking and feeling on me\nAll this jewelry on me, it's kinda hard to see\nMigo Gang Ent!\n\n[Hook 2]"}}, {"title": "All Good", "album": "Rich Nigga Timeline",

stacking money\nTalking bout I treat her like Macaulay Culkin\nCause she stay at home alone\nBut it\u2019s all good though\n\n[Hook: Takeoff]\nWhen I come in with them M&Ms\nAnd tell you to count up this big bankroll\nEverything good though\nTold me stop trapping but you told me\nThat you wanna get up out the hood though\nAll my hard work, it done paid off\nShawty stayed down since day one\nGot to keep her by my side like my Tommy gun\nPut on my jewelry baby, shine like the sun\n\n[Verse 1: Takeoff]\nOkay I be on a private jet to Portuguese to just pick up some Benjamin Franklins\nFrom some people I ain\u2019t never seen\nThe OGs keep telling me boy you gon make history\nTold my bitch you better ask about a nigga in these streets\nWe can go to MIA to see the palm trees\nLamborghini, man we pull up on Daytona Beach\nWhen I look into her eyes I make her panties leak\nShe still probably won\u2019t believe so we taking a trip to go to Belize\nBut it\u2019s all good though\n\n[Hook:

know you\u2019re shining baby\nLooking like some VVS diamonds baby\nWant to thank your mama, my god what a creation\nWanna welcome you into my mansion with an invitation\nI\u2019m a young nigga, ain\u2019t used to relations\nSo you know I ain\u2019t patient\nShe told me she black and she Asian\nLook how she walk when she came in\nShe hate it when I got to go on the road\nBut she like it when I bring back the hundos\nShe cooking spaghetti and gumbo\nMama told me don\u2019t eat no sauce from no hoes\nBut you know a nigga really like you\nBut you tryna shut down my empire\nThat\u2019s my lifestyle, like the wire\nYou too bipolar, baby you fire\n\n[Pre-Hook: Takeoff]\nBaby keep on calling my phone\nWanna know when I\u2019ma come home\nShe telling me that I be fucking bitches\nAnd I

used to cuffing the women but I\u2019m gonna save her\nBooty fatter than Deelishis, when I hit her we lay up\nWe together, get up on our knees and we say our prayers\nAin\u2019t no trials and tribulations, we having some patience\n25 she got two cars, and a house that she pays for\nSo what else could I ask for, first night I was mad, I didn't smash\nAnd that taught me a lesson, lil mama got to be special\nShe just want to kick it with me, we can travel wherever\nShe know I got a busy schedule, sometimes she be acting selfish\nWhen I hit her she be quitting cause she say it\u2019s too much pleasure\nShe telling me her favorite song is Handsome and Wealthy\nShe love it when I\u2019m kissing on her body, start to melt her\nI be murdering the pussy, I should have another felon\nWe sticking together just like we salt and pepper\nBut it's all good though\n\n[Pre-Hook: Takeoff]\nBaby keep on calling my phone\nWanna know when I\u2019ma come home\nShe telling me that I be fucking

telling me that I be fucking bitches\nAnd I told her that she trippin'\nCause you must be high off shrooms\nWant to investigate me when I come in the room\nTalking bout where you been at\nAnd why you ain\u2019t pick up your phone?\nI\u2019ve been on the road stacking money\nTalking bout I treat her like Macaulay Culkin\nCause she stay at home alone\nBut it\u2019s all good though\n\n[Hook: Takeoff]\nWhen I come in with them M&Ms\nAnd tell you to count up this big bankroll\nEverything good though\nTold me stop trapping but you told me\nThat you wanna get up out the hood though\nAll my hard work, it done paid off\nShawty stayed down since day one\nGot to keep her by my side like my Tommy gun\nPut on my jewelry baby, shine like the sun\n\n[Verse 1: Takeoff]\nOkay I be on a private jet to Portuguese to just pick up some Benjamin Franklins\nFrom some people I ain\u2019t never seen\nThe OGs keep telling me boy you gon make history\nTold my bitch you better ask about a nigga in these streets\nWe can go to MIA to see the palm trees\nLamborghini, man we pull up on Daytona Beach\nWhen I look into her eyes I make her panties leak\nShe still probably won\u2019t believe so we taking a trip to go to Belize\nBut it\u2019s all good though\n\n[Hook: Takeoff]\nWhen I come in with them M&Ms\nAnd tell you to count up this big bankroll\nEverything good though\nTold me stop trapping but you told me\nThat you wanna get up out the hood though\nAll my hard work, it done paid off\nShawty stayed down since day one\nGot to keep her by my side like my Tommy gun\nPut on my jewelry baby, shine like the sun\n\n[Verse 2: Quavo]\nQuavo talk to em' ooh\nYou know you\u2019re shining baby\nLooking like some VVS diamonds baby\nWant to thank your mama, my god what a creation\nWanna welcome you into my mansion with an invitation\nI\u2019m a young nigga, ain\u2019t used to relations\nSo you know I ain\u2019t patient\nShe told me she black and she Asian\nLook how she walk when she came in\nShe hate it when I got to go on the road\nBut she like it when I bring back the hundos\nShe cooking spaghetti and gumbo\nMama told me don\u2019t eat no sauce from no hoes\nBut you know a nigga really like you\nBut you tryna shut down my empire\nThat\u2019s my lifestyle, like the wire\nYou too bipolar, baby you fire\n\n[Pre-Hook: Takeoff]\nBaby keep on calling my phone\nWanna know when I\u2019ma come home\nShe telling me that I be fucking bitches\nAnd I told her that she trippin'\nCause you must be high off shrooms\nWant to investigate me when I come in the room\nTalking bout where you been at\nAnd why you ain\u2019t pick up your phone?\nI\u2019ve been on the road stacking money\nTalking bout I treat her like Macaulay Culkin\nCause she stay at home alone\nBut it\u2019s all good though\n\n[Hook: Takeoff]\nWhen I come in with them M&Ms\nAnd tell you to count up this big bankroll\nEverything good though\nTold me stop trapping but you told me\nThat you wanna get up out the hood though\nAll my hard work, it done paid off\nShawty stayed down since day one\nGot to keep her by my side like my Tommy gun\nPut on my jewelry baby, shine like the sun\n\n[Verse 3: Offset]\nI had to fly out to Vegas to show her that I\u2019m a player\nI\u2019m not used to cuffing the women but I\u2019m gonna save her\nBooty fatter than Deelishis, when I hit her we lay up\nWe together, get up on our knees and we say our prayers\nAin\u2019t no trials and tribulations, we having some patience\n25 she got two cars, and a house that she pays for\nSo what else could I ask for, first night I was mad, I didn't smash\nAnd that taught me a lesson, lil mama got to be special\nShe just want to kick it with me, we can travel wherever\nShe know I got a busy schedule, sometimes she be acting selfish\nWhen I hit her she be quitting cause she say it\u2019s too much pleasure\nShe telling me her favorite song is Handsome and Wealthy\nShe love it when I\u2019m kissing on her body, start to melt her\nI be murdering the pussy, I should have another felon\nWe sticking together just like we salt and pepper\nBut it's all good though\n\n[Pre-Hook: Takeoff]\nBaby keep on calling my phone\nWanna know when I\u2019ma come home\nShe telling me that I be fucking bitches\nAnd I told her that she trippin'\nCause you must be high off shrooms\nWant to investigate me when I come in the room\nTalking bout where you been at\nAnd why you ain\u2019t pick up your phone?\nI\u2019ve been on the road stacking money\nTalking bout I treat her like Macaulay Culkin\nCause she stay at home alone\nBut it\u2019s all good though\n\n[Hook: Takeoff]\nWhen I come in with them M&Ms\nAnd tell you to count up this big bankroll\nEverything good though\nTold me stop trapping but you told me\nThat you wanna get up out the hood though\nAll my hard work, it done paid off\nShawty stayed down since day one\nGot to keep her by my side like my Tommy gun\nPut on my jewelry baby, shine

Regal\nMy mom used to trap off a beeper\nI look at the molly and eat them\nI am all out of narcotics\nAll of my bitches exotic\nYou niggas drinking on Watson\nI keep the chopper for plotting\nI keep the white like cotton\nLook at your pot, it's rotten\nWe're never going in a drought\nJunkies coming in and out\nI used to run in your house\nWrapping up you and your spouse\nI used to be sleep on the couch\nAnd now I cash out, no amount\nI pop a Perc and then I'm out\nI spent two million on a house\nRun the money up like a route\nSober niggas out of style\nCobra niggas get the power\nFifty thousand for the style\nI'm in the Coupe with no miles\nBalling like Darius Miles\nIf you own the drug I\u2019m on, you need to pull up right now\nI pop it off, feel like a ghost\nMy niggas doing the most\nI'm never gon' set up my folks\nI got more sand than the coast\n\n[Chorus: Quavo]\nI put a mil in the attic\nI fell in love with the drugs, I think I'm a addict\nPercocet, molly, and Xanax\nI

Designer drugs\n\n[Verse 2: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]\nSlipping, cripping, drinking blood\nShort bus shawty on the school bus\nI think I'm on everything but the dust\nItching like a junkie when I'm on Tuss\nI pop a Perc and the Vicodin\nGrab me a Fanta, I'm spiking it\nDab in Designer, they biting it\nI hit the mall and the pharmacist\nThese broke niggas drinking on Qualitest\nI take off on drinking on Actavis\nHope they free my nigga 'Set in the set\nFly like a plane with a Louis baggage\nCurling Backwoods, step into the maximum\nPlug on Designer drugs and I'm taxing them\nStep on a brick in Givenchy\nMoving slow, drinking breast cancer\nI pop a test, jump in a tesla\nPut down a brick, served a pedestrian\nSo many bricks, they think I'm a Mexican\nPut on my reading glasses with finesse\nHold on the white, she gave me Becky\nPop the pussy like a Smith and Wesson\nFucked that little bitch at the Westin\nI\u2019m on a 'shroom, extraterrestrial\n\n[Chorus: Quavo]\nI put a mil in the attic\nI fell in love with the drugs, I think I'm a addict\nPercocet, molly, and Xanax\nI feel like I land on the planet\nI'm on Designer drugs, on Designer drugs, on Designer drugs\nI'm on

Quavo]\nDisrupted the game, the industry was shook up\nThree young rich niggas, never did a push up\nYou want the origin of the flow, you better shut the fuck up\nAnd listen up, to what the Migos bout to cook up\n\n[Verse 1: Quavo]\nWe killed the Versace, we went to Bahamas, shout out to the islands\nMommas and daughters taking a picture with me and they smiling\nCharlemagne say the gang Donkey of the Day (Charlamagne?)\nBillboard magazine, 45K\nWord on the street they say the Migos wanted\nBut they can't find the Migos, so they bite their recorders\nWhen you ask for a show, can you seriously afford it\nCheck my schedule, itinerary loaded of course\nCheck my dab, it's priceless\nAnd my niggas is righteous\nI don't got no type, but I love to fuck Pisces\nThe chains on my neck, I might get arthritis\nYRN Tha Album first album going diamond\nGot my mama a Benz\nJust to show her I'm grinding\nGreen dots in the pen but I hate the confinement\nWhen Offset got out of jail he ate a bowl of hundreds\nDropped the Rich Nigga Timeline and we was crossed the country\n\n[Chorus]\nDisrupted the game, the industry was shook up\nThree young rich niggas, never did a push up\nYou want the origin of the flow, you better shut the fuck up\nAnd listen up, to what the Migos bout to cook up\n\n[Verse 2: Offset]\nSkrrt, cook up\nGraat, he shook up\nI'm trapping the white, that Ku Klux\nMy niggas got grenades and bazookas\nOn the private jet we smoking up in indica\nA hundred thousand, got a pick up in India\nHeaded to locker, we changed the millennium\nThirty thousand for a walk through minimum\nSnakes in the grass start spinning out venom\nThat come with the territory when a nigga winning\nTinted windows on the sprinter you don't need to see this image\nThe blogs say I need to calm down, fuck a image\nYour CEO a busta and my CEO a hustler\nChoppa sound like percussion, run up on me repercussion\nCame from nothing, came home with a half a million, hurt my stomach\nI'm taking good care of my kids but they mamma get nothing\nAnd if you think its wrong this ain't the right song you're bumping\nWelcome to the jungle, lions, elephants and monkeys\nNever see me lonely, best believe nina on me\nStuffed crust, my pocket walking with a 50 on me\n\n[Chorus]\nDisrupted the game, the industry was shook up\nThree young rich niggas, never did a push up\nYou want the origin of the flow, you better shut the fuck up\nAnd listen up, to what the Migos bout to cook up\n\n[Verse 3: Takeoff]\nPyrex pot on the stove, take that eggbeater cook up\nThey looking for the origin, wanna know how did we make this shit up\nCame in there right and we fucking it up\nJump off the banana boat, call me King Tut\nNiggas be biting our swag I tried to switch it up\nBut these niggas still don't get enough\nNiggas with attitude don't give a fuck\nYoung nigga flexing never did a push up\nMigo flow everybody wanna look it up\nEvery ten years it's on my story bro\nI bet you listen up, you don't gotta like it\nYo favorite rapper he be biting\nWhen I step in the booth, its a moment of silence\nI bet yo bitch she get excited\nWhen I'm doing show my front end and that back end be enormous\nI need a double cup with my Backwood when I'm on stage performing\nCan't get in my tour bus bitch, ain't tryna fuck, it's only 5 in the morning\nI got some Dominican bitches that sucking and fucking and back to the origin\n\n[Chorus]\nDisrupted the game, the industry was shook up\nThree young rich niggas, never did a push up\nYou want the origin of the flow, you better shut the fuck up\nAnd listen

"[Intro]\nSo what part of Atlanta y'all from?\nFrom the north side\nUh, yeah\nEvery show get crazy and crazy\nWe growing and growing every, every, every time at a show\n\n[Chorus: Quavo]\nDisrupted the game, the industry was shook up\nThree young rich niggas, never did a push up\nYou want the origin of the flow, you better shut the fuck up\nAnd listen up, to what the Migos bout to cook up\n\n[Verse 1: Quavo]\nWe killed the Versace, we went to Bahamas, shout out to the islands\nMommas and daughters taking a picture with me and they smiling\nCharlemagne say the gang Donkey of the Day (Charlamagne?)\nBillboard magazine, 45K\nWord on the street they say the Migos wanted\nBut they can't find the Migos, so they bite their recorders\nWhen you ask for a show, can you seriously afford it\nCheck my schedule, itinerary loaded of course\nCheck my dab, it's priceless\nAnd my niggas is righteous\nI don't got no type, but I love to fuck Pisces\nThe chains on my neck, I might get arthritis\nYRN Tha Album first album going diamond\nGot my mama a Benz\nJust to show her I'm grinding\nGreen dots in the pen but I hate the confinement\nWhen Offset got out of jail he ate a bowl of hundreds\nDropped the Rich Nigga Timeline and we was crossed the country\n\n[Chorus]\nDisrupted the game, the industry was shook up\nThree young rich niggas, never did a push up\nYou want the origin of the flow, you better shut the fuck up\nAnd listen up, to what the Migos bout to cook up\n\n[Verse 2: Offset]\nSkrrt, cook up\nGraat, he shook up\nI'm trapping the white, that Ku Klux\nMy niggas got grenades and bazookas\nOn the private jet we smoking up in indica\nA hundred thousand, got a pick up in India\nHeaded to locker, we changed the millennium\nThirty thousand for a walk through minimum\nSnakes in the grass start spinning out venom\nThat come with the territory when a nigga winning\nTinted windows on the sprinter you don't need to see this image\nThe blogs say I need to calm down, fuck a image\nYour CEO a busta and my CEO a hustler\nChoppa sound like percussion, run up on me repercussion\nCame from nothing, came home with a half a million, hurt my stomach\nI'm taking good care of my kids but they mamma get nothing\nAnd if you think its wrong this ain't the right song you're bumping\nWelcome to the jungle, lions, elephants and monkeys\nNever see me lonely, best believe nina on me\nStuffed crust, my pocket walking with a 50 on me\n\n[Chorus]\nDisrupted the game, the industry was shook up\nThree young rich niggas, never did a push up\nYou want the origin of the flow, you better shut the fuck up\nAnd listen up, to what the Migos bout to cook up\n\n[Verse 3: Takeoff]\nPyrex pot on the stove, take that eggbeater cook up\nThey looking for the origin, wanna know how did we make this shit up\nCame in there right and we fucking it up\nJump off the banana boat, call me King Tut\nNiggas be biting our swag I tried to switch it up\nBut these niggas still don't get enough\nNiggas with attitude don't give a fuck\nYoung nigga flexing never did a push up\nMigo flow everybody wanna look it up\nEvery ten years it's on my story bro\nI bet you listen up, you don't gotta like it\nYo favorite rapper he be biting\nWhen I step in the booth, its a moment of silence\nI bet yo bitch she get excited\nWhen I'm doing show my front end and that back end be enormous\nI need a double cup with my Backwood when I'm on stage performing\nCan't get in my tour bus bitch, ain't tryna fuck, it's only 5 in the morning\nI got some Dominican bitches that sucking and fucking and back to the origin\n\n[Chorus]\nDisrupted the game, the industry was shook up\nThree young rich niggas, never did a push up\nYou want the origin of the flow, you better shut the fuck up\nAnd listen up, to what the Migos bout to cook up"}}], "artist": "Migos"}
