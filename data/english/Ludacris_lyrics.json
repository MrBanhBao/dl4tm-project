No! Could it be that a G really got you sprung?\nI lost my count baby how many times did I make it cum?\nRun, run, run from a nigga til you can't no more like Forrest Gump\nThen it's more she gets, if it's more she wants\nShe's spoiled rotten like bad milk\nGet her hot cause I make that ass melt\nShe whipped cause she love gettin' whipped in the whip\nAnd I'ma black belt\nI beat the pussy to pieces, never lettin' the cat off the leashes\nAnd I'm goin' so deep they tellin' me all of they deepest and darkest secrets\n\n[Chorus: Jeremih]\nI need party girls in my party world\nTitties plastic, ass fantastic\nThey just brush my hair and touch me everywhere\nI don't say shit and they be gettin' naked\nI don't say shit and they be gettin' naked\nI don't, I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked, naked\nSay shit and they be gettin' naked\nI don't, I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked\n\n[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]\nThrow some ones on that\nGet you wet as a waterpark I'ma have some fun with that\nMake you come back to back you gon' bust like a gun with that\nLike pow pow, brrr, pow pow, brrr\nMy bitch be gettin' down nigga how 'bout yours?\nSo turnt up when we in the club we don't even need a molly\nDoin' so much over in this corner thought we was fuckin' in the party\nMy lung's filled with Marley\nMy hands on your body\nAnd I'm goin' so deep I'm just lettin' you know that this me I got your face all in the pillow\nYou can't speak\n\n[Chorus: Jeremih]\nI need party girls in my party world\nTitties plastic, ass fantastic\nThey just brush my hair and touch me everywhere\nI don't say shit and they be gettin' naked\nI don't say shit and they be gettin' naked\nI don't, I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked, naked\nSay shit and they be gettin' naked\nI don't, I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked\n\n[Bridge: Jeremih]\nI came to party like tonight will never end\nLet's party again\nLet's party again\nYea, I came to party like tonight will never end\nLet's party again\nLet's party again\nLet's party again\n\n[Chorus: Jeremih]\nI need party girls in my party world\nTitties plastic, ass fantastic\nThey just brush my hair and touch me everywhere\nI don't say shit and they be gettin' naked\nI don't say shit and they be gettin' naked\nI don't, I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked, naked\nSay shit and they be gettin' naked\nI don't, I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8bac12a0a129a12bfb74aa4cf13ac39f.640x640x1.jpg", "artist": "Ludacris", "raw": {"annotation_count": 19, "api_path": "/songs/351361", "apple_music_id": "810835902", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/351361/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "Ludacris, Jeremih, and Wiz Khalifa team up for this eerie, yet suave sounding club banger, produced by Cashmere Cat.

it\nPop that, pop that and you'll be bustin' them nuts when you want to bust it\nDon't rush it mama I'ma take my time and do it slow\nFrom the car to the counter to the bed to the couch to the tub to the flo'\nOh! No! Could it be that a G really got you sprung?\nI lost my count baby how many times did I make it cum?\nRun, run, run from a nigga til you can't no more like Forrest Gump\nThen it's more she gets, if it's more she wants\nShe's spoiled rotten like bad milk\nGet her hot cause I make that ass melt\nShe whipped cause she love gettin' whipped in the whip\nAnd I'ma black belt\nI beat the pussy to pieces, never lettin' the cat off the leashes\nAnd I'm goin' so deep they tellin' me all of they deepest and darkest secrets\n\n[Chorus: Jeremih]\nI need party girls in my party world\nTitties plastic, ass fantastic\nThey just brush my hair and touch me everywhere\nI don't say shit and they be gettin' naked\nI don't say shit and they be gettin' naked\nI don't, I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked, naked\nSay shit and they be gettin' naked\nI don't, I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked\n\n[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]\nThrow some ones on that\nGet you wet as a waterpark I'ma have some fun with that\nMake you come back to back you gon' bust like a gun with that\nLike pow pow, brrr, pow pow, brrr\nMy bitch be gettin' down nigga how 'bout yours?\nSo turnt up when we in the club we don't even need a molly\nDoin' so much over in this corner thought we was fuckin' in the party\nMy lung's filled with Marley\nMy hands on your body\nAnd I'm goin' so deep I'm just lettin' you know that this me I got your face all in the pillow\nYou can't speak\n\n[Chorus: Jeremih]\nI need party girls in my party world\nTitties plastic, ass fantastic\nThey just brush my hair and touch me everywhere\nI don't say shit and they be gettin' naked\nI don't say shit and they be gettin' naked\nI don't, I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked, naked\nSay shit and they be gettin' naked\nI don't, I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked\n\n[Bridge: Jeremih]\nI came to party like tonight will never end\nLet's party again\nLet's party again\nYea, I came to party like tonight will never end\nLet's party again\nLet's party again\nLet's party again\n\n[Chorus: Jeremih]\nI need party girls in my party world\nTitties plastic, ass fantastic\nThey just brush my hair and touch me everywhere\nI don't say shit and they be gettin' naked\nI don't say shit and they be gettin' naked\nI don't, I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked, naked\nSay shit and they be gettin' naked\nI don't, I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked"}}, {"title": "Good Lovin'", "album": "Ludaversal", "year": "2014-12-15", "lyrics": "[Intro: Miguel]\nI keep dwellin' on the past, babe\nKnow what I need, yeah\n\n[Hook: Miguel]\nI need some real good lovin'\nCause I'm troubled by the things that I see\nI need some real good lovin'\nCause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me\n\n[Verse 1: Ludacris]\nIt's better to love and then lost than to never have loved at all\nIf that was true I wouldn't be drinking this alcohol\nEvery relationship failed to take a toll on you\nEspecially when you had hoes and area codes on you\nIs it easier to erase my memories\nAt a point when most of my past women became my enemies?\nSome on the fence, some befriended me\nBut when we see each other it's gon' be some weird energy\nI'm sorry that we couldn't make it work\nBelieve in your heart, I never intended to make you hurt\nNow they see me on the blogs with my new girl\nFriends talking 'bout \"that's supposed to be you, girl\"\n\n[Hook: Miguel]\nI need some real good lovin'\nCause I'm troubled by the things that I see\nI need some real good lovin'\nCause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me\n\n[Verse 2: Ludacris]\nI got a empty hole in my chest\nHow do I fill it? Somebody give a prescription\nI guess I gotta learn to live with regrets\nPay for mistakes and your exes take a commission\nBut what's a percent off the top when you hit the bottom\nAfter you break up wondering how to live without 'em?\nNeed solutions, less problems\nCause if love will drive you crazy I belong in the insane asylum\nHear the rain, feel the pain inside 'em\nKinda lost, need someone to guide 'em\nIt's nothin' worse than feelin' alone\nBut I'll admit to feelin' better when I'm hearing this song, it goes\n\n[Hook: Miguel]\nI need some real good lovin'\nCause I'm troubled by the things that I see\nI need some real good lovin'\nCause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me\n\n[Bridge: Miguel]\nSo I, dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat, baby\nPlaying empty songs when I'm blowing my high\nFeeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed\nOn an empty bed\nDwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat\nPlaying empty songs when I'm blowing my high\nFeeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed\nWhile I lose my mind\nSo you know what I need\n\n[Hook: Miguel]\nI need some real good lovin'\nCause I'm troubled by the things that I see\nI need some real good lovin'\nCause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2986e54b122204912b36c1ad529dd0f4.988x940x1.png", "artist": "Ludacris", "raw": {"annotation_count": 9, "api_path": "/songs/562658", "apple_music_id": "974143494", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/562658/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "\u201cGood Lovin\u201d shares its name and some lyrics with the original number 1 hit by Rascals.\n\nThe track first appeared on Burning Bridges EP in December 2014.

good lovin'\nCause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me\n\n[Verse 1: Ludacris]\nIt's better to love and then lost than to never have loved at all\nIf that was true I wouldn't be drinking this alcohol\nEvery relationship failed to take a toll on you\nEspecially when you had hoes and area codes on you\nIs it easier to erase my memories\nAt a point when most of my past women became my enemies?\nSome on the fence, some befriended me\nBut when we see each other it's gon' be some weird energy\nI'm sorry that we couldn't make it work\nBelieve in your heart, I never intended to make you hurt\nNow they see me on the blogs with my new girl\nFriends talking 'bout \"that's supposed to be you, girl\"\n\n[Hook: Miguel]\nI need some real good lovin'\nCause I'm troubled by the things that I see\nI need some real good lovin'\nCause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me\n\n[Verse 2: Ludacris]\nI got a empty hole in my chest\nHow do I fill it? Somebody give a prescription\nI guess I gotta learn to live with regrets\nPay for mistakes and your exes take a commission\nBut what's a percent off the top when you hit the bottom\nAfter you break up wondering how to live without 'em?\nNeed solutions, less problems\nCause if love will drive you crazy I belong in the insane asylum\nHear the rain, feel the pain inside 'em\nKinda lost, need someone to guide 'em\nIt's nothin' worse than feelin' alone\nBut I'll admit to feelin' better when I'm hearing this song, it goes\n\n[Hook: Miguel]\nI need some real good lovin'\nCause I'm troubled by the things that I see\nI need some real good lovin'\nCause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me\n\n[Bridge: Miguel]\nSo I, dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat, baby\nPlaying empty songs when I'm blowing my high\nFeeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed\nOn an empty bed\nDwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat\nPlaying empty songs when I'm blowing my high\nFeeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed\nWhile I lose my mind\nSo you know what I need\n\n[Hook: Miguel]\nI need some real good lovin'\nCause I'm troubled by the things that I see\nI need some real good lovin'\nCause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me"}}, {"title": "My Chick Bad", "album": "Battle of the Sexes", "year": "2010-02-23", "lyrics": "[Hook]\nMy chick bad, my chick hood\nMy chick do stuff that your chick wish she could\nMy-my chick bad, my chick hood\nMy chick do stuff that your chick wish she could\n(DTP!)\nMy-my chick bad, badder-badder than yours\nMy-my chick bad, badder-badder than yours\nMy-my-my chick bad, badder-badder than yours\nMy-my chick bad, badder-badder than yours\n\n[Verse 1 - Ludacris]\nListen, I'm sayin' my chick bad, my chick hood\nMy chick do stuff that your chick wish she could\nMy chick bad, badder than yours\nMy chick do stuff that I can't even put in words\nHer swagger don't stop, her body won't quit\nSo fool pipe down, you ain't talkin 'bout shit\nM-m-my chick bad, tell me if you seen her\nShe always bring the racket like Venus and Serena\nAll white top, all white belt\nAnd all white jeans, body lookin like milk\nNo-no time for games, she's full grown\nMy chick bad, tell yo' chick to go home\n\n[Hook]\nMy chick bad, my chick hood\nMy chick do stuff that your chick wish she could\nMy-my chick bad, my chick hood\nMy chick do stuff that your chick wish she could\n(Let's go!)\nMy-my chick bad, badder-badder than yours\nMy-my chick bad, badder-badder than yours\nMy-my-my chick bad, badder-badder than yours\nMy-my chick bad, badder-badder than yours\n\n[Verse 2 - Ludacris]\nNow-now-now-now-now-now, now your girl might be sick but my girl's sicker\nShe rides that dick and she handles her liquor\nWill knock a bitch out, annnnd fight\nComin' out swingin' like Tiger Woods' wife\nYeahhh, she could get a little hasty\nChicks better cover up they chest like pasties\nCouple girlfriends and they ALL a little crazy\nComin down the street like a parade, Macy's\n(Whoo!)

now\nGive it to me now, give it to me now\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nGive it to me now, give it to me now\nGive it to me now\n\n[Chorus: Ludacris & Shawna]\nI wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes\nAnd I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'\nThen I wanna, \"Ahh ahh,\" you make it so good I don't wanna leave\nBut I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?\nI wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes\nAnd I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'\nThen I wanna, \"Ahh ahh,\" you make it so good I don't wanna leave\nBut I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?\n\n[Verse 1: Ludacris]\nI wanna get you in the Georgia Dome on the 50-yard line\nWhile the Dirty Birds kick for t'ree\nAnd if you like in the club, we can do it\nIn the DJ booth or in the back of the V.I.P\nWhipped cream with cherries and strawberries on top, lick it don't stop\nKeep the door locked, don't knock while the boat rock\nWe go-bots and robots, so they got to wait til the show stop\nOr how about on the beach with black sand?\nLick up your thigh then call me the Pac Man\nTable top or just give me a lap dance\nThe Rock to the Park to the Point to the Flatlands\nThat man Ludacris (woo!) in the public bathroom\nOr in back of the classroom\nHow ever you want it, lover-lover gonna tap that ass soon\nSee I cast 'em and I passed 'em\nGet a tight grip and I grasp 'em\nI flash 'em and outlast 'em\nAnd if ain't good then I trash 'em\nWhile you stash 'em, I'll let 'em free\nAnd they tell me what they fantasy\nLike up on the roof, roof\nTell your boyfriend not to be mad at me!\n\n[Chorus: Ludacris & Shawna]\nI wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes\nAnd I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'\nThen I wanna, \"Ahh ahh,\" you make it so good I don't wanna leave\nBut I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?\nI wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your

fan-ta-ta-sy?\n\n[Verse 2: Ludacris]\nI wanna get you in the bath tub\nWith the candles lit; you give it up 'til they go out\nOr we can do it on stage at the Ludacris concert\n'Cause you know it got sold out!\nA red carpet dick it just roll out\nGo ahead and scream, you can't hold out\nWe can do it in the pouring rain\nRunning the train, when it's hot or when it's cold out\nHow about in the library on top of books?\nBut you can't be too loud!\nYou wanna make a brother beg for it\nGive me TLC 'cause you know I be too proud\nWe can do it in the White House\nTry to make them turn the lights out\nChampagne with my campaign\nLet me do the damn thing\nWhat's my name, what's my name, what's my name?\nA sauna, jacuzzi, in the back row at the movie\nYou can scratch my back and rule me\nYou can push me and just pull me\nOn hay in middle of the barn\nRose petals on the silk sheets\nEating fresh fruits, sweep your woman right off her feet\n\n[Chorus: Ludacris & Shawna]\nI wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes\nAnd I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'\nThen I wanna, \"Ahh ahh,\" you make it so good I don't wanna leave\nBut I gotta kn-kn-kn-know,

good I don't wanna leave\nBut I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?\n\n[Verse 3: Ludacris]\nI wanna get you in the back seat, windows up\nThat's the way you like to fuck\nClogged up, fog alert\nRip the pants and rip the shirt\nRough sex: make it hurt\nIn the garden all in the dirt\nRoll around Georgia Brown: that's the way I like it, twerk\nLegs jerk, overworked\nUnderpaid, but don't be afraid\nIn the sun or up in the shade\nOn the top of my Escalade\nMaybe your girl and my friend can trade\nTag team, off the ropes!\nOn the ocean or in the boat!\nFactories or one hundred spokes!\nWhat about up in the candy store?\nThat chocolate, chocolate make it melt\nWhips and chains, handcuffs\nSmack a little booty up with my belt\nScream \"help!\" Play my game!\nDracula, man, I'll get my fangs\nHorseback and I'll get my reins\nSchool teacher, let me get my brains\n\n[Chorus: Ludacris & Shawna]\nI wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes\nAnd I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'\nThen I wanna, \"Ahh ahh,\" you make it so good I don't wanna leave\nBut I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?\nI wanna, li-li-li-lick you

arrive safely at death?\nI'm on a journey, yeah I'm on a roll\nSometimes gotta close my eyes just to open my soul\nAnd tonight is the night I got a feeling that I'm about to act a fool\nSo if you go fix some drinks me and Usher about to break some rules\n\n[Hook: Usher]\nThat's somewhere to go, but the world is movin' slow\nI was born for the fast life\nI go for broke, a lesson I can't afford\nBut for what it's worth I'm ready to pay\nFor the rest of my life\nFor the rest of my life\nOh, oh, oh\n\n[Break: Usher]\nNa na, hey, oh\nNa na, hey, oh\nNa na, hey, oh\nNa na, hey\nFor the rest of my life\n\n[Verse 2: Ludacris]\nIf I got one life to live, I'ma party 'til I'm dead\nWhat the hell is a life worth livin' if it's not on the edge?\nTryna keep my balance, I'm twisted so just in case I fall\nWritten on my tombstone should say \"Women, Weed, and Alcohol\"\n\n[Hook: Usher]\nThat's somewhere to go, but the world is movin' slow\nI was born for the fast life\nI go for broke, a

hey\n\n[Interlude: Usher]\nIf you live for somethin', you're not alone my friend\nSo fill up your cup, lift your lighters, a toast to life\n\n[Verse 3: Ludacris]\nI'm stuck in this moment, freeze the hands of time\nCause I feel inner peace when I'm out of my mind\nAnd you can call me crazy, but I like to roll the dice\nSo I'm willin' to bet that I'ma be crazy for the rest of...\n\n[Outro:

candy-paint Cadillacs kill\nSo check out the hoes my Cadillac fills\n20-inch wide, 20-inches high\nHo, don't you like my 20-inch ride?\n20-inch thighs make 20-inch eyes\nHoping for American 20-inch pies\nPretty-ass clothes, pretty-ass toes\nOh, how I love these pretty-ass hoes\nPretty-ass, high-class, anything goes\nCatch 'em in the club throwing pretty-ass bows\nLong john drawers, long john stalls\nAny stank puss make my long john pause\nWomen on their cell making long john calls\nAnd if they like to juggle, get long john's balls\n\n[Chorus: Ludacris & (Pharrell)]\nAll my players in the house that can buy the bar\nAnd the ballin'-ass niggas with the candy cars\nIf you a pimp and you know you don't love them hoes\nWhen you get on the floor (nigga throw dem bows)\nAll my women in the house if you chasing cash\nAnd you got some big titties with a matching ass\nWith your fly-ass boots or your open-toes\nWhen you get on the floor (nigga throw dem 'bows)\n\n[Verse 2: Ludacris]\nDirty South mind blowing Dirty South bread\nCatfish fried up, Dirty South fed\nSleep in a cot'-picking Dirty South bed\nDirty South gurrls give me Dirty South head\nHand-me-down flip-flops, hand-me-down socks\nHand-me-down drug dealers hand me down rocks\nHand me down a 50-pack Swisher Sweets box\nAnd goodfella rich niggas hand me down stocks\nMouth full of platinum, mouth full of gold\n40-Glock cal' keep your mouth on hold\nLie through your teeth, you could find your mouth cold\nAnd rip out your tongue cause of what your mouth told\nSweat for the lemonade, sweat for the tea\nSweat from the hot sauce, sweat from the D\nAnd you can sweat from a burn in the 3rd degree\nAnd if you sweat in your sleep, then you sweat from me\n\n[Chorus: Ludacris & (Pharrell)]\nAll my players in the house that can buy the bar\nAnd the ballin'-ass niggas with the candy cars\nIf you a pimp and you know you don't love them hoes\nWhen you get on the floor (nigga throw dem bows)\nAll my women in the house if you chasing cash\nAnd you got some big titties with a matching ass\nWith your fly-ass boots or your open-toes\nWhen you get on the floor (nigga throw dem 'bows)\n\n[Verse 3: Ludacris]\nHit by stars, hit by cars\nDrunk off the liquor getting hit by bars\nKeep your girl close cause she's a hit, by far\nHit by the Neptunes, hit by guitars\nAfro picks, Afro-chicks\nI let my \"Soul Glow\" from my Afro dick\nRabbit out the hat, pulling Afro tricks\nAfro-American, Afro thick\nOverall country, overall jeans\nOverall Georgia, we overall clean\n\"Southern Hospitality\" or \"overall mean\"\nOverall triple, overall beams\nThugged-out niggas wear thugged-out chains\nThugged-out blocks playing thugged-out games\nAll black, tinted up thugged-out RangeDTP stay doing thugged out thangs\n\n[Chorus: Ludacris & (Pharrell)]\nAll my players in the house that can buy the bar\nAnd the ballin'-ass niggas with the candy cars\nIf you a pimp and you know you don't love them hoes\nWhen you get on the floor

throw dem bows)\nAll my women in the house if you chasing cash\nAnd you got some big titties with a matching ass\nWith your fly-ass boots or your open-toes\nWhen you get on the floor (nigga throw dem 'bows)\n\n[Verse 3: Ludacris]\nHit by stars, hit by cars\nDrunk off the liquor getting hit by bars\nKeep your girl close cause she's a hit, by far\nHit by the Neptunes, hit by guitars\nAfro picks, Afro-chicks\nI let my \"Soul Glow\" from my Afro dick\nRabbit out the hat, pulling Afro tricks\nAfro-American, Afro thick\nOverall country, overall jeans\nOverall Georgia, we overall clean\n\"Southern Hospitality\" or \"overall mean\"\nOverall triple, overall beams\nThugged-out niggas wear thugged-out chains\nThugged-out blocks playing thugged-out games\nAll black, tinted up thugged-out RangeDTP stay doing thugged out thangs\n\n[Chorus: Ludacris & (Pharrell)]\nAll my players in the house that can buy the bar\nAnd the ballin'-ass niggas with the candy cars\nIf you a pimp and you know you don't love them hoes\nWhen you get on the floor (nigga throw dem bows)\nAll my women in the house if you chasing cash\nAnd you got some big titties with a matching ass\nWith your fly-ass boots or your open-toes\nWhen you get on the floor (nigga throw dem 'bows)\nAll my players in the house that can buy the bar\nAnd the ballin'-ass niggas with the candy cars\nIf you a pimp and you know you don't

S-s-so c'mon c'mon\nDON'T ... get swung on, swung on\nIt's the knick knack paddywhack, still ride in Cadillacs\nFamily off the street! made my homies put the baggies back\nStill stacking plaques! (yep!) still action packed! (yep!)\nAnd dough!! I keep it flipping like acrobats!\nThat's why I pack a mac, that'll crack 'em back\nCause on my waist there's more Heat than the Shaq Attack\nBut I ain't speaking about ballin, ballin\nJust thinking about brawlin till y'all start bawlin\nWe all in together now, birds of a feather now\nJust bought a plane so we changing the weather now\nSo put your brakes on, caps put your capes on\nOr knock off your block, get dropped and have your face flown\nCause I'll prove it! scratch off the music!\nLike hey little stupid! don't make me lose it!!\n\n[Chorus]\nYeek yeek!

Man shut the fuck up!!\n\n[Chorus]\nYeek yeek!

The club and the moon is full\nAnd I'm looking for a thick, young lady to pull\nOne sure shot way to get them out of them pants\nTake note to the brand new dance\nLike this\n\n[Hook: Ludacris & Shawnna]\nWhen I move, you move just like that?\nWhen I move, you move just like that?\nWhen I move, you move just like that?\nHell yeah, hey DJ bring that back\nWhen I move, you move just like that?\nWhen I move, you move just like that?\nWhen I move, you move just like that?\nHell yeah, hey DJ bring that back\n\n[Verse 2: Ludacris]\nGo on with your big ass, let me see something\nTell your little friend he can quit mean mugging\nI'm lit and I don't care what no one thinks\nBut where the fuck is the waitress at with my drinks?\nMy people outside and they can't get in\nWe gon' rush the back door & break them in\nThe owner already pissed cause we sort of late\nBut our time and our clothes, got to coordinate\nMost girls looking right, some looking a mess\nThat's why they spilling drinks all over your dress\nBut Louis Vuitton bras all over your breasts\nGot me wanting to put hickeys all over your chest\nAhh, come on we gon' party tonight\nY'all use mouth to mouth bring the party to life\nDon't be scared, show another part of your life\nThe more drinks in your system, the harder the fight\n\n[Hook: Ludacris & Shawnna]\nWhen I move, you move just like that?\nWhen I move, you move just like that?\nWhen I move, you move just like that?\nHell yeah, hey DJ bring that back\nWhen I move, you move just like that?\nWhen I move, you move just like that?\nWhen I move, you move just like that?\nHell yeah, hey DJ bring that back\n\n[Bridge: Ludacris]\nStand up! Stand up!\nStand up! Stand up!\n\n[Verse 3: Ludacris]\nDamn right, the fire marshal wanna shut us down\nGet us out, so someone can gun us down\nWe was two songs away from getting so cut up\nNow we one song away from tearing the club up\nMove over; Luda got something to say\nDo it now cause tomorrow ain't promised today\nWork with me, let's become one with the beat\nAnd don't worry about me stepping all over your feet\n\n[Hook: Ludacris & Shawnna]\nWhen I move, you move just like that?\nWhen I move, you move just like that?\nWhen I move, you move just like that?\nHell yeah, hey DJ bring that back\nWhen I move, you move just like that?\nWhen I move, you move just like that?\nWhen I move, you move just like that?\nHell yeah, hey DJ bring that back\n\n[Outro: Ludacris]\nStand up!

me\nI'm the goddamn reason you in V.I.P\nCEO, you don't have to see ID\nI'm young, wild, and strapped like Chi-Ali\nBLAOW, we ain't got nothing to worry about\nWhoop ass, let security carry them out\nWatch out for the medallion, my diamonds are reckless\nIt feels like a midget is hanging from my necklace\nI pulled up with a million trucks\nLooking, smelling, feeling like a million bucks, ahh\nPass the bottles, the heat is on\nWe in the huddle all smoking that Cheech & Chong\nWhat's wrong? The club and the moon is full\nAnd I'm looking for a thick, young lady to pull\nOne sure shot way to get them out of them pants\nTake note to the brand new dance\nLike this\n\n[Hook: Ludacris & Shawnna]\nWhen I move, you move just like that?\nWhen I move, you move just like that?\nWhen I move, you move just like that?\nHell yeah, hey DJ bring that back\nWhen I move, you move just like that?\nWhen I move, you move just like that?\nWhen I move, you move just like that?\nHell yeah, hey DJ bring that back\n\n[Verse 2: Ludacris]\nGo on with your big ass, let me see something\nTell your little friend he can quit mean mugging\nI'm lit and I don't care what no one thinks\nBut where the fuck is the waitress at with my drinks?\nMy people outside and they can't get in\nWe gon' rush the back door & break them in\nThe owner already pissed cause we sort of late\nBut our time and our clothes, got to coordinate\nMost girls looking right, some looking a mess\nThat's why they spilling drinks all over your dress\nBut Louis Vuitton bras all over your breasts\nGot me wanting to put hickeys all over your chest\nAhh, come on we gon' party tonight\nY'all use mouth to mouth bring the party to life\nDon't be scared, show another part of your life\nThe more drinks in your system, the harder the fight\n\n[Hook: Ludacris & Shawnna]\nWhen I move, you move just like that?\nWhen I move, you move just like that?\nWhen I move, you move just like that?\nHell yeah, hey DJ bring that back\nWhen I move, you move just like that?\nWhen I move, you move just like that?\nWhen I move, you move just like that?\nHell yeah, hey DJ bring that back\n\n[Bridge: Ludacris]\nStand up! Stand up!\nStand up! Stand up!\n\n[Verse 3: Ludacris]\nDamn right, the fire marshal wanna shut us down\nGet us out, so someone can gun us down\nWe was two songs away from getting so cut up\nNow we one song away from tearing the club up\nMove over; Luda got something to say\nDo it now cause tomorrow ain't promised today\nWork with me, let's become one with the beat\nAnd don't worry about me stepping all over your feet\n\n[Hook: Ludacris & Shawnna]\nWhen I move, you move just like that?\nWhen I move, you move just like that?\nWhen I move, you move just like that?\nHell yeah, hey DJ bring that back\nWhen I move, you move just like that?\nWhen I move, you move just like that?\nWhen I move, you move just like that?\nHell yeah, hey DJ bring that back\n\n[Outro: Ludacris]\nStand up!

front row and watch me perform\n(You do that and you gonna learn today)\n\n[Chorus: Kelly Rowland & Ludacris]\nI\u2019ll be representing, representing\nGet on that thang, get on that thang\nGet on

edible, unforgettable\nBody is so angelical, the rebel with a cause\nSpeaking in hypotheticals\nCould I marry you if I wanted to\nI\u2019ll take you how you coming\nJust learn to live with your flaws\nEven though it\u2019s not that many\nYou give me that good and plenty\nThen I walk around all day grinning\nMy mind and body are gone\nThat jj so sublime throw it in the air and turn to sunshine\nYou make me wanna call the crib\nAnd say I\u2019m never coming home, Luda!\nWhile you saying\n\n[Pre-Hook: Kelly Rowland, Ludacris, Both]\nJust wanna keep all your attention baby (Keep all

room, room\n\n[Verse 1: Ludacris]\nHah, welcome to my little sanctuary\nYou been lookin' so good all day\nAnd you really got a nigga pretty anxious ba-by\nBetter call your boss, tell him that your daddy's home\nTake a couple days off and take it off\nAnd leave nothin' but yo' T-shirt and your panties on\nFeelin' high but I'm hung real low, lookin' sorta like a tri-pod\nSo power down your cell phone, and power up your iPod\nPower down your inhibitions, and power up your inner freak\nYes, yeah fuck, is the only words that you finna speak\nIt's about to get real X-rated, can you handle what I'm 'bout to do?\nBut enough about me, let me think should I be worryin' about if I can handle you?\nDamn right I'ma get that thang and I'ma put my name on it\nAll night I'ma whip that thang, Allstate better put a claim on it\nI claim my territory, my tongue finna mark you up\nYou could be my firecracker, my tongue finna spark you up\nGet ready for blast-off, waterfalls gon' splash off\nYou might lose around four or five pounds so get ready to sweat your ass off\n\n[Hook: Trey Songz]\nWelcome to my sex room, where your body meets my body\nIt's our private afterparty, if you want it girl I got it\nIn my sex room, candles and the pole\nSex your body to your soul, from the bed down to the floor\nSex room, mirrors in the headboard\nEven got a camcord', baby, won't you dance\nIn my sex room, where your body meets my body\nIt's our private afterparty, if you want it girl, I got it\nIn my sex room\n\n[Verse 2: Ludacris]\nLet the candles burn, I'ma turn these lights down\nAnd when your body gets hot, it'll get you licked up, and iced down\nNipples hard as rocks, lips as soft as cotton\nYou the apple of my eye, and I got you spoiled rotten\nI'ma get my video camera, let's make a movie baby\nYou the star, so as soon as I press record, you gots to do me baby\nYou could stare all in the mirror, take a peak at how good you lookin'\nI'ma have your body smokin', take a look at what Luda's cookin'\nMy arm underneath your leg, legs all behind your head is how I gots to getcha\nRight hand, left hand on red in the bed like we been playin' Twister\nNow I got you tangled up, and you caught all in my web\nShould I let you loose? Nah, I think I'll get the blindfold instead\nYou better get a couple towels baby 'cause we about to slip and slide\nYou don't ever need a horse or a saddle, I'ma give you this dick to ride\nI'ma grant your every wish, and fulfill your fantasy\nAin't nobody else allowed in the sex room, it's only you and me\n\n[Hook: Trey Songz]\nWelcome to my sex room, where your body meets my body\nIt's our private afterparty, if you want it girl I got it\nIn my sex room, candles and the pole\nSex your body to your soul, from the bed down to the floor\nSex room, mirrors in the headboard\nEven got a camcord', baby, won't you dance\nIn my sex room, where your body meets my body\nIt's our private afterparty, if you want it girl, I got it\n\n[Verse 3: Trey Songz]\nListenin' to what your body say, we can do it every other kind of way\nHit it in the sun, up in the shade, tell me what it is, I got you babe\nBaby, let's hop up in the shower, baby, let me snatch up off that towel\nLet me get a vowel, I-O-U, so I-E-U mean I eat you\nTo my sex, to my sex, come into this room\nTo my sex, to my sex, you know what I'mma do\nTo my sex, to my sex, grab my body tight, don't let me go\nHow you wanna ride? Just let me know\nIn my sex room, oh room, room, oh, oh, oh\nKnow that I want it, baby yeah\nTo my sex, to my sex, with your toes pointed\nSo baby, welcome to my sex room\n\n[Hook: Trey Songz]\nWelcome to my sex room, where your body meets my body\nIt's our private afterparty, if you want it girl I got it\nIn my sex room, candles and the pole\nSex your body to your soul, from the bed

them handlebars\nGotta keep a tight grip on that donkey\nShe be givin' out battle scars\n'Cause she got a tight grip on that monkey\nShe told me, all the weight, go straight to that ass\nMake a student be late for the class\nShe make a nigga wanna holla even throw a couple dollars\nSo I gotta get straight to the cash\nI love big cheeks in between them sheets\nJump back, I can't help myself\nGot a nigga so weak and I get no sleep\n'Cause the girls stay wetter than Michael Phelps\nAnd she get right down to the business\nShe stimulate the five senses\nAnd she like it when I grab her hair\nBut I might pull out them extensions\nMy intentions is good for her\nShe like that I'm rich and a lil hood for her\nI beat it right and leave it good sore\nReal niggas is always what I stood for\nI'm all in, I don't play with it\nI fall in and I lay in it\nIf I call in, I might stay in it\nAnd if it's all a sin, then I'll pray in it\n\n[Chorus: Ludacris & Ty Dolla $ign]\nYeah, she need

her boots when they thigh high\nGuess it's true what they say when you're havin' fun, the time, it really do fly by\nTake her legs, put 'em sky high\nClimb to the top, I'ma skydive\nOff, you feel the pump like it's sawed off\nShot gun, hold tight, don't fall off\nWork, I'ma call off\nDon't be tryna leave, lil mama, that's too much ass to haul off\nYou need a U-Haul, if you leave me, woman, I'ma

that's just, you know\nThey just deficient in so many things, man\nYou missing so many key nutrients in your life\nI, I just want you to stay healthy in these streets\nOh, no no\nSomebody gotta give you some vitamin D, you know what I mean?\nYeah, Luda\n\n[Verse 1: Ludacris]\nShe got them handlebars\nGotta keep a tight grip on that donkey\nShe be givin' out battle scars\n'Cause she got a tight grip on that monkey\nShe told me, all the weight, go straight to that ass\nMake a student be late for the class\nShe make a nigga wanna holla even throw a couple dollars\nSo I gotta get straight to the cash\nI love big cheeks in between them sheets\nJump back, I can't help myself\nGot a nigga so weak and I get no sleep\n'Cause the girls stay wetter than Michael Phelps\nAnd she get right down to the business\nShe stimulate the five senses\nAnd she like it when I grab her hair\nBut I might pull out them extensions\nMy intentions is good for her\nShe like that I'm rich and a lil hood for her\nI beat it right and leave it good sore\nReal niggas is always what I stood for\nI'm all in, I don't play with it\nI fall in and I lay in it\nIf I call in, I might stay in it\nAnd if it's all a sin, then I'll pray in it\n\n[Chorus: Ludacris & Ty Dolla $ign]\nYeah, she need her fix tonight (fix tonight)\nWhoever she been with, he just ain't hittin' it right (hittin' it right)\nSo let me have my way with both your lips tonight (lips tonight)\nGirl, take this D, I don't want you gettin' sick tonight (sick tonight, sick tonight)\nShe said go another round for me (go another round for me)\nShe said she can take this D (she said she can take it)\nShe said go another round for me (go another round for me)\nShe said she can take this D, take the D (she said she can take it)\n\n[Verse 2: Ludacris]\nShe got them thunder thighs\nI'm just tryna get struck by some lightnin'\nMan, her booty is plus her size\nAnd I like my cakes with some icin'\nYeah baby, [ciero a milo\nQue a sabora azucca]\nBonita, freaky lil chica\nLet's try the whole Kama Sutra, get down\nDrip down, let it trickle down, dig her down\nSmack it up, flip it and rub it down, love her down\nI'ma keep it 100 now, that girl nasty\nI'm never lettin' the opportunity pass me\nBut I love her boots when they thigh high\nGuess it's true what they say when you're havin' fun, the time, it really do fly by\nTake her legs, put 'em sky high\nClimb to the top, I'ma skydive\nOff, you feel the pump like it's sawed off\nShot gun, hold tight, don't fall off\nWork, I'ma call off\nDon't be tryna leave, lil mama, that's too much ass to haul off\nYou need a U-Haul, if you leave me, woman, I'ma get blue balls\n'Cause ain't nobody got sex like you\nThat can dress like you or impress like you\nYou make a brother wanna woosa\n\n[Chorus: Ludacris & Ty Dolla $ign]\nYeah, she need her fix tonight (fix tonight)\nWhoever she been with, he just ain't hittin' it right (hittin' it right)\nSo let me have my way with both your lips tonight (lips tonight)\nGirl, take this D, I don't want you gettin' sick tonight (sick tonight, sick tonight)\nShe said go another round for me (go another round for me)\nShe said she can take this D (she said she can take it)\nShe said go another round for me (go another round for me)\nShe said she can take this D, take the D (she said she can take it)\n\n[Verse 3: Ludacris]\nOoh, she got that snapback\nKinda ass if you blink, that it might hurt you\nAll up on the Snapchat\nTry to get a screenshot and she might curse you\nThat there be your eyes only\nLove when she grind on me\nIf they said I'm talkin' shit\nYou know someone was lyin' on me\nShe ain't for that he say, she say\nThis shakin' the DJ replay\nIs like everyday is her bday\n'Cause everyday's her get this D day\nAnd she got to work with a smile on\nAnd her skin is always glowin'\nAnd her JJ ain't all in the streets\n'Cause she ain't out her hoein', Luda\n\n[Chorus: Ludacris & Ty Dolla $ign]\nYeah, she need her fix tonight (fix tonight)\nWhoever she been with, he just ain't hittin' it right (hittin' it right)\nSo let me have my way with both your lips tonight (lips tonight)\nGirl, take this D, I don't want you gettin' sick tonight (sick tonight, sick tonight)\nShe said go another round for me (go another round for me)\nShe said she can take this D (she said she can take it)\nShe said go another round for me (go another round for me)\nShe said she can take this D, take the D (she said she can take it)"}}, {"title": "Hip Hop Quotables", "album": "Chicken-n-Beer", "year": "2003-10-07", "lyrics": "[Verse: Ludacris]\nHi, my name's Ludacris, and I'm high as giraffe pussy\nAnd I'm close to the edge, so your parents can come push me\nI curse so much just to get on they nerves\nI got kids actin' a fool from the traps to the 'burbs\nMy filthy mouth, it won't fight cavities or beat plaque\nSo I shot the tooth fairy and put my old teeth back\nI take a shit on the equator, the size of a crater\nAnd make government officials breathe harder than Darth Vader\nIt's the chicken and the beer that makes Luda keep rappin'\nBut no pork on my fork, I don't even speak pig Latin\nI go fishin' on my lake, with yo bitch as the bait\nPlus I eat many MCs, but I don't gain no weight\nThe numba one chief rocka, clean out yo' rap lockers\nI'm as stiff as a board, y'all more shook than maracas\nBut my trix ain't for kids, if you dig'um you'll get smacked\nI'll clock ya I'll spring forward, you fall back\nEvery album that I drop has got more than ten bangers\nThat's cause I'm a shot caller, y'all fools is Crank Yankers\nAin't a damn thing changed but the ice on my chain\nTo get chicks from Portland, Oregon to Portland, Maine\nNow I roll up torpedoes, get blunted with rastas\nFor a hefty fee, I'm on your record like Bob Costas\nI own so many jerseys, I'm a throwback mess\nI hit the cleaners and tell 'em I want a full court press\nSo momma toast your glass while I'm countin' my cash\nCause every single is a smash, I'm hot as a camel's ass\nThe competition never just wanna admit that they lost\nAnd that they last about as long as my part in the wash\nFrom yo' car to a crap game, no one rolls wit'chu\nOne of Mini Me's shoes got more sole than you\nSo by the time you figure out why your record ain't spinnin'\nI'm in the strip club smokin', with President Clinton\nSo stand clear of the long sideburns and goatee\nThey made the mold of the penis enlarger off me\nI'll be in another room when I hit from the back\nNot to mention my refrigerator's taller than Shaq\nSo yippie kay yay, yippie yie yie yo\nIf you can't swim, don't smoke my hydro\nI've been lookin for a woman just to put my stamp on\nBut a lot of y'all are mo' stuck up than tampons\nSo wash all ya sins away and stop playin'\nIf God's line is busy you might have to two way him\nThen catch me in your backyard, playin' croquet\nAnd when I'm drunk tell them kids, drugs are bad, mmm'kay?\nOr watch me swing my chain at the Roscoe's off Pico\nGot seven cars, get all my rims at Chrome Depot\nAnd people think I'm bad, they say \"Oh he's so Evil!\"\nCause I go on blind dates, with actual blind people\nBut my album's out the store, yours be on the shelf\nI heard you masturbate a lot, so y'all keep to yourself\nCause these women want a man that stay up and stay strong\nLike the NBA, you gotta play hard or go home\nAll that shit that y'all talkin', y'all can pop it to them\nCause Ludacris'll beat you down with a prosthetic limb\nI put my foot so deep in yo' ass that you can smell it\nAnd yo' breath will turn to Foot Locker water repellant\nI'm the man, I got money far as the eyes can see\nAnd I'm in a group, I split dough with me, me and me\nSo much money in my jewelry that I'm damn near sorry\nSo I'mma trade my earrings in, and get a Ferrari\nI buy cars with straight cash, have meetings with Donald Trump\nY'all meet with Honda, no payments for 12 months\nTake a look at yo' life, and no wonder you so sad\nY'all put up with more shit than a colostomy bag, fool", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1498cf277a7dc50ffc916ca191c3608f.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Ludacris", "raw": {"annotation_count":

the Roscoe's off Pico\nGot seven cars, get all my rims at Chrome Depot\nAnd people think I'm bad, they say \"Oh he's so Evil!\"\nCause I go on blind dates, with actual blind people\nBut my album's out the store, yours be on the shelf\nI heard you masturbate a lot, so y'all keep to yourself\nCause these women want a man that stay up and stay strong\nLike the NBA, you gotta play hard or go home\nAll that shit that y'all talkin', y'all can pop it to them\nCause Ludacris'll beat you down with a prosthetic limb\nI put my foot so deep in yo' ass that you can smell it\nAnd yo' breath will turn to Foot Locker water repellant\nI'm the man, I got money far as the eyes can see\nAnd I'm in a group, I split dough with me, me and me\nSo much money in my jewelry that I'm damn near sorry\nSo I'mma trade my earrings in, and get a Ferrari\nI buy cars with straight cash, have meetings with Donald Trump\nY'all meet with Honda, no payments for 12 months\nTake a look at yo' life, and no wonder you so sad\nY'all put up with more shit than a colostomy bag, fool"}}, {"title": "Say It To My Face", "album": "1.21 Gigawatts: Back To the First Time", "year": "2011-11-15", "lyrics": "[Chorus:

ACT A FOOL\nIf you about to get drunk and you ready to mob\nBOY whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL\n\n[Verse 2: Ludacris]\nLet's take it to the streets cuz I'm ready to cruise\nJust bought me and my cars all some brand new shoes\nAnd the people just stare so I LOVE TO PARK IT\nAnd I just put a computer in the glove compartment\nWith the pedal to the floor, radar in the GRILLE\nTV in the middle of my STEERING WHEEL\nIt's my car's birthday so we BLOWIN THEM CANDLES\nMore speakers in the trunk than my ride can handle\nGot my name in the headrest, read it and weep\nNOS tank in the back, camel hair on the seat\nAnd when I pull up to the club, I get all the affection\nCuz the women love the paint and they can see their reflection\nI'm about to take off, so F what ya heard\nBecause my side mirrors flap like a FUCKIN BIRD\nAnd the fools, we gon CLOCK ONE and we'll POP ONE\nCuz my folk ridin shotgun with a shotgun\n\n[Hook: Ludacris]\nYou just got hustled for a wad of cash\nMan whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL\nNow your friends just smoked up your brand new stash\nSay whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL\nNow them gulls up the block still runnin they mouth\nBOY whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL\nIf anyone talk bad about the Dirty South\nTell me what I'm gon do? ACT A FOOL\n\n[Verse 3: Ludacris]\nI got my eyes wide shut and my trunk wide open\nDid donuts last week and the streets still smoking\nSee, I'm off that anti-freeze and my car is TIPSY\nOff the off ramp doin about a hundred and fifty\nRollin through East Point, on way to Ben Hill\nSlide a five to the junkie to clean my windshield\nGot the whole crew ridin and we startin SHIT\nI even got a trailer hitch with the barbeque pit\nNow all you wanna do is get drunk and pout\nPlus your new name is Fire cuz we stomped you out\nAnd yeah, we blow trees and beez that's fantastic\nSo gulls hold ya weave while I'm weaving through traffic\nI kicked to fifth gear and teared the road apart\nYou'll be like lil John Q and get a Change of Heart\nIt's one mission, two clips and some triple beams\nI'm ABOUT TO BLOW THIS WHOLE SHIT UP TO SMITHEREENS\n\n[Hook: Ludacris]\nThe pot holes in the street just bentcha rims\nTell me whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL\nMAN, THAT AIN'T STICKY, THAT'S JUST STICKS AND STEMS\nBOY whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL\nCatch ya man with another bitch up in ya bed\nLadies whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL\nIf the bottles all gone and your eyes are red\nBOY whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL\n\n[Ludacris]\n2 Fast, 2 Furious...\n2 Fast... ACT A FOOL\n2 Fast, 2 Furious...\n2 Fast...

drop that\nWe rollin' on twenties, with the top back\nSo much money, you can't stop that\n\nTwin Glock forties, cocked back\nMe and my homies, so drop that\nWe rollin' on twenties, with the top back\nSo much money, you can't stop that\n\n[Verse 1]\nNow, where'd you get that platinum chain, with them diamonds in it?\nWhere'd you get that mackin' Benz, with them windows tinted?\nWho them girls, you be with, when you be ridin' through?\nMan, I ain't got nothin' to prove, I paid my dues\nBreakin' the rules, I shake fools, while I'm takin' a cruise\nTell me who's your weed man and how do you smoke so good?\nYou's a superstar, boy, why you still up in the hood?\nWhat in the world is in that bag, what you got in that bag?\nA couple of cans, a whoop ass, you did a good ass job\nOf just eyein' me, spyin' me\n\n[Hook]\nI got my twin Glock forties, cocked back\nMe and my homies, so drop that\nWe rollin' on twenties, with the top back\nSo much money, you can't stop that\n\nTwin Glock

in the fuck did you get it?\nThat's eighty thousand bucks gone\nWhere in the fuck did you spend it?\nYou must have eyes on your back\nCause you got money to the ceilin'\nAnd the bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin'\nThe better I'm feelin', the more that I'm chillin'\nWinnin', drillin' and killin' the feelin'\nNow, who's that bucket naked cook, fixin' three course meals?\nGettin' goosebumps with her body tapped in six inch heels\nWhat in the world is in that room, what you got in that room?\nA couple of gats, a couple of knives, a couple of rappers\nA couple of wives, now it's time to choose\n\n[Hook]\nI got my twin Glock forties, cocked back\nMe and my homies, so drop that\nWe rollin' on twenties, with the top back\nSo much money, you can't stop that\n\nTwin Glock forties, cocked back\nMe and my homies, so drop that\nWe rollin' on twenties, with the top back\nSo much money, you can't stop that\n\n[Verse 3]\nAre you custom made, custom paid, or you just custom fitted?\nPlaystation 2 up in the ride, is that Lorenzo-kitted?\nIs that your wife, your girlfriend or just your main bitch?\nYou take a pick, while I'm rubbin' the hips\nTouchin' lips to the top of the dick and then whew\nNow, tell me who's your housekeeper\nAnd what you keep in your house?\nWhat about diamonds and gold\nIs that what you keep in your mouth?\nWhat in the world is in that case, what you got in that case?\nGet up out my face, you couldn't relate\nWait to take place at a similar pace, so shake, shake it\n\n[Hook]\nI got my twin Glock forties, cocked back\nMe and my homies, so drop that\nWe rollin' on twenties, with the top back\nSo much money, you can't stop that\n\nTwin Glock forties, cocked back\nMe and my homies, so drop that\nWe rollin' on twenties, with the top

the fuck up out my business\nCause it's mine, oh, mine\n\nMy business, my business\nStay the fuck up out my business\nCause these niggas all up in my shit\nAnd it's my business, my business\nStay the

Glock forties, cocked back\nMe and my homies, so drop that\nWe rollin' on twenties, with the top back\nSo much money, you can't stop that\n\n[Verse 1]\nNow, where'd you get that platinum chain, with them diamonds in it?\nWhere'd you get that mackin' Benz, with them windows tinted?\nWho them girls, you be with, when you be ridin' through?\nMan, I ain't got nothin' to prove, I paid my dues\nBreakin' the rules, I shake fools, while I'm takin' a cruise\nTell me who's your weed man and how do you smoke so good?\nYou's a superstar, boy, why you still up in the hood?\nWhat in the world is in that bag, what you got in that bag?\nA couple of cans, a whoop ass, you did a good ass job\nOf just eyein' me, spyin' me\n\n[Hook]\nI got my twin Glock forties, cocked back\nMe and my homies, so drop that\nWe rollin' on twenties, with the top back\nSo much money, you can't stop that\n\nTwin Glock forties, cocked back\nMe and my homies, so drop that\nWe rollin' on twenties, with the top back\nSo much money, you can't stop that\n\n[Verse 2]\nMan, that car don't come out, until next year\nWhere in the fuck did you get it?\nThat's eighty thousand bucks gone\nWhere in the fuck did you spend it?\nYou must have eyes on your back\nCause you got money to the ceilin'\nAnd the bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin'\nThe better I'm feelin', the more that I'm chillin'\nWinnin', drillin' and killin' the feelin'\nNow, who's that bucket naked cook, fixin' three course meals?\nGettin' goosebumps with her body tapped in six inch heels\nWhat in the world is in that room, what you got in that room?\nA couple of gats, a couple of knives, a couple of rappers\nA couple of wives, now it's time to choose\n\n[Hook]\nI got my twin Glock forties, cocked back\nMe and my homies, so drop that\nWe rollin' on twenties, with the top back\nSo much money, you can't stop that\n\nTwin Glock forties, cocked back\nMe and my homies, so drop that\nWe rollin' on twenties, with the top back\nSo much money, you can't stop that\n\n[Verse 3]\nAre you custom made, custom paid, or you just custom fitted?\nPlaystation 2 up in the ride, is that Lorenzo-kitted?\nIs that your wife, your girlfriend or just your main bitch?\nYou take a pick, while I'm rubbin' the hips\nTouchin' lips to the top of the dick and then whew\nNow, tell me who's your housekeeper\nAnd what you keep in your house?\nWhat about diamonds and gold\nIs that what you keep in your mouth?\nWhat in the world is in that case, what you got in that case?\nGet up out my face, you couldn't relate\nWait to take place at a similar pace, so shake, shake it\n\n[Hook]\nI got my twin Glock forties, cocked back\nMe and my homies, so drop that\nWe rollin' on twenties, with the top back\nSo much money, you can't stop that\n\nTwin Glock forties, cocked back\nMe and my homies, so drop that\nWe rollin' on twenties, with the top back\nSo much money, you can't stop that\n\n[Outro]\nGet out my business, my business\nStay the fuck up out my business\nCause these niggas all up in my shit\nAnd it's my business, my business\nStay the fuck up out my business\nCause it's mine, oh, mine\n\nMy business, my business\nStay the fuck up out my business\nCause these niggas all up in my shit\nAnd it's my business, my business\nStay the fuck up out my business\nCause it's mine, oh, mine\n\nTimberland, Ludacris, Disturbing Tha Peace"}},

name?\nIf you jot down ya number you'll get mine in exchange (heyy)\nSee I'm the man of this town\nAnd I hope you wouldn't mind if I showed you around\nSo when you go to certain places you'll be thinkin of me\nWe got, people to meet and many places to see (heyy)\nMm, I'm really diggin' ya lips\nBut be careful where you walkin' when you swingin' them hips\nCause I'm kinda concerned that you'll be causin' a crash\nWith your traffc jam booty heads pausin' so fast (heyy)\nI would'nt trade you for the world I swear it\nI like ya hair and every style that you wear it\nAnd how the colors cordinate with your clothes\nFrom your manicured nails to your pedicured toes\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Ludacris]\nYeah, you hear the song so dance\nDon't always think I'm tryna get in your pants\nCause see me my pimpin's in 3D\nI'm takin' you places you only see on TV\nTryna show ya how you livin' is trife\nHow many guys you know can bring the travel channel to life\nOne day we on the Autobahn, swervin drivin\nNext day we in the sun on the Virgin Islands\nIf you with me ain't no time to sleep\nEspecially at Wet Willies on Miami Beach\nBut I drive you off and pay you no attention\nIf make it to Atlantas Brina Brothers convention\nThen jump in the car and just ride for hours\nMakin' sure I don't miss the homecoming at Howard\nHawaii to D.C. it's plenty women to see\nSo if yo ass don't show up it's more women for me (heyy)\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Ludacris]\nI'm in New York at the Puerto Rican Day Parade\nThen at night I'm in New Orleans drinkin' hand grenades\nOutnumbered by the dozens at the jazz fest\nIn Mardi Gras all the women tryna show me they chest (heyy)\nI'm in Jamaica spendin massive bucks\nWhile the ladies all beggin' me to mashatuck\nI had, sad beginnings when I rapped with no fans\nNow it's all happy endings on my lap in Japan (heyy)\nI used to think that it was way too cold\n'Til I went to Canada and saw some beautiful hoes\nNow I hit the Caribana every year in Toronto\nThen fly to Illinois to get a taste of Chicago (ugh)\nOh yet and still\nYou wouldn't believe your eyes if you went to Brazil\n(But where the best at?) Ain't no need of even askin' brah\nThe best women all reside in Africa, and that's real\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Ludacris]\nSing it, hoes (The world, the world, the world)\n\n[Outro: Katt Williams]\nPimpin' pimpin' pimpin'\nLadies and gentlemen as we ride out\nCould we have all the real pimps\nPlease put both of your pinky fingers high in the air?\nNow ladies look around with me\nLet's see if we can weed some of these niggas out\nCause it's no way that all these niggas could be pimpin'\nNow if you happen to see a nigga\nWith two sweat patches up under his arms\nLook like he been swimmin' in shoulder height water\nPlease tell that nigga \"put your hands down\"\nIf you smell like you been at work all day and your car\nPlease \"put your hands down\"\nNow look up at the pinky fingers that are still in the air\nIf you see him ashy around the knuckles\nLike the nigga wash half of his hands\nAnd lotion three quarters of his body\nPlease say \"put your hands down\"\nIf your spinnin' rims spin counter clockwise, you are not pimpin'\nIf you are dancin' on the dancefloor\nAnd you look to your left and your right\nAnd you do not see a woman in sight\nGuess what? You guessed it - you are not pimpin\nIf your Vodka and Cranberry is really really dark like blood\nThat's because you didn't order Vodka buddy\nThat's why it's three dollars a glass\n\"Put your hands down\"\nNow look down, look down\nI need everybody to pull up your pants leg one time\nOkay, you see the nigga with the white socks\nNOT PIMPIN!\nSorry unless you part of the \"Beat It\" entorauge\nIf your shoes have a buckle on..."}}, {"title": "My Chick Bad (Remix)", "album": "Battle of the Sexes", "year": "2010-03-08", "lyrics": "[Hook]\nMy chick bad, my chick hood\nMy chick do stuff that your chick wish she could\nMy-my chick bad, my chick hood\nMy chick do stuff that your chick wish she could\nMy-my chick bad, badder-badder than yours\nMy-my chick bad, badder-badder than yours\nMy-my-my chick bad, badder-badder than yours\nMy-my chick bad, badder-badder than yours\n\n[Ludacris]\nYeah, ha ha (you're right.. you're right)\nThe \"pussy rules the world\" version\nYou ready?

rappers want it, they can get it\nFlow tighter than four fat bitches sittin' in a Civic\nMy flows are unimaginable, Hannibal Lecter shit\nEatin' emcees for breakfast, bitch\nSince I was born to touch the mic,The First Time it's been a problem\nYour life was a mistake, your pops should've wore a condom\nYou niggas think you hard, I think you better come harder (Go hard)\nI leave rappers confused, like will.i.am's barber\nAh, fuckin' with Luda's not a great look\nA verse'll make your fans, unfriend you on Facebook\nClick, my styles are goin' into labor\nSo if stars won a war, I'm their daddy like Darth Vader\nAnd since I'm always high, it's kind of hard to overlook me\nFor over a hundred stacks, it's kind of hard to overbook me\nAnd a whole 'nother house for my cars is on my checklist\nCause to fit 'em in one garage, is like a nigga playin' Tetris\nBut they say patience is a virtue, cause I got your bitch stayin' out way past her curfew\nGuess I was a thief, that got away with these words\nSlangin' chickens out my whip, like I been playin' Angry Birds\nIn a black Rolls Royce, Dark Knight like Batman\nEverywhere you turn, the Ghost follows like Pac-Man\nAnd I sleep with the John Dillinger\nAnd always keep an eye half-open, like Forest Whitaker\nNo, you boys ain't ready for combat\nBe more worried if I renew my Def Jam contract\nWhat path is he on? Opponents, I laugh and be gone\nThey handin' in the towels like they work in Bed, Bath & Beyond\nBut in the midst of all the melee, y'all niggas just bitches with dicks like Sheneneh\nYour rap styles are phony, your lines are just dead\nAnd I be on them lines, like a nigga just played\nGuess I'm tryin' to say I'm advanced, you intermediate\nYou wouldn't know the real me, if your bitch Wikipedia'd it\nJust know that I never tried to be hard\nProbably cause Mr. Glock 40's my security guard\nYou'll get chopped like judo\nGangs in my hood make you reverse\nAnd change your color like the block's playin' Uno\nAnd, yes, some of my friends is still sellin' them drugs\nBut I just say they Weight Watchers like Jennifer Hud\nThey show me love\nThat's why I'll always stay reppin' until the death of me\nRappers talk shit, but ain't nobody ever stepped to me\nI hereby command all my fans' to inject it\nOverdose on Red Bull in your veins, if you ever slept on me\n(wake up)\nYeah, my mind is sharper than a guillotine\nAll the nines extended, from the knuckles of Wolverine\nNot a X-Man, but, man, I got that X\nSome of my artists switch labels, but I still get a check\nThe more albums they sell, the more we all win\nAnd I can be seen in thirty rocks like Alec Baldwin\nOr watchin' CBS in a Cadillac DTS\nI plan to reach the world, man, your plan is MetroPCS\n(can you hear me now)\nI changed my music up cause I was gettin' bored\nYou may not like the way I shoot, but my points go on the board\nMy name still engrained and these books will be the outcome\nAnd this one verse is harder than a lot of niggas' albums\n\n[Outro]\nPeace, fuck out of here, rewind that shit\nHa-ha-ha, Luda, ain't shit changed"}}, {"title": "Badaboom", "album": "1.21 Gigawatts: Back To the First Time", "year":

it\nMay not like the way I use it but you know you ain't invent it boy\nDo your research before you make a claim so bogus\nThat's disrespecting pioneers in the game\nFuck the fame but go ahead and get ya 5 minutes\nThen you front line cadets can report to your lieutenants\nSee I\u2019m ya past, I\u2019m ya future and ya present\nSo watch ya fucking mouth when you speak about a legend\n16 times

"lyrics": "Big Bada boom, Luda\u2019s in this bitch\nPussy niggas clear the room\nI came through the door, I said it before\nI\u2019m the truth in this booth and you niggas all hoes\nCounterfeit rappers say I\u2019m stealing their flows\nBut I can\u2019t steal what you never made up bitch\nY\u2019all some duplicate rap cloning niggas\nI manufacture you hoes -- put on your makeup, bitch\nLet me explain, nothing\u2019s been new since Big Daddy Kane\nFlows will get recycled passed around to different names\nBut what\u2019s the same, that every verse I spit is insane\nGot more styles than any rapper in the game, 11 years and still counting\nAnd y'all get a couple hit records, make some noise and have the nerve to start shouting\nWho\u2019s gassing \u2018em, they blowing smoke up your ass, you fired up but I\u2019m just puff puff passing \u2018em\nUntil they roaches, buried in my ashtray\nNigga burn slow, better pray like it\u2019s your last day\nYou lying to yourself, just admit it\nMay not like the way I use it but you know you ain't invent it boy\nDo your research before you make a claim so bogus\nThat's disrespecting pioneers in the game\nFuck the fame but go ahead and get ya 5 minutes\nThen you front line cadets can report to your lieutenants\nSee I\u2019m ya past, I\u2019m ya future and ya present\nSo watch ya fucking mouth when you speak about a legend\n16 times platinum, 6 number 1 peaks\nSo I can give a fuck what you sold in ya first week\nYou\u2019s weak, softer than the Pillsbury dough boy\nDon\u2019t make me expose the truth, you\u2019s a ho, boy\nDon\u2019t make me get on that \"Stomp\" shit and get back at it\nYou rappers ain't even in my fucking tax bracket\nWhy am I wasting my time\nYeah I admit I get a little ludicrous with my rhymes, sometimes\nBut my fans know the difference because \u201cMy Chick Bad\u201d went platinum\nStill winning, motherfucker\n\nThe nerve of you niggas man\nYou ain't got enough medals on your jacket to address me boy\nFall back in formation, y\u2019all outta line\nI was told not to kill a mosquito with a cannon\nSo the next time you gnats got a real problem\nDon\u2019t be a coward like a nigga that used to be signed to me going on twitter rants and shit\nNigga, say it to my face"}}, {"title": "Growing Pains", "album": "Word of Mouf", "year": "2001-11-27", "lyrics": "[Fate Wilson]\nOkay, I remember the days\nHigh rights, low lefts, even stevens and fades\nTroops, Lottos, and BKs, those was the days\nHi-tec boots spray painted witcha names\nT-shirts airbrushed that read the same\nThick herringbone chain, one gold with yo' initial\nHarris Photos, group shots, can you remember?\nBarry him told his bitch go to the prom and die\nDidn't lie shot his-self in the head with the 4-5\nWhen she disobeyed, had North Clayton crazed\nJust to reiterate dog those was the days\nFo' the invasions of haters, man crews from all around\nUsed to get down at True Flavas, bumpin Key Lo\nRockin Damage, Cross Colour and Paco\nWhile playboys stepped in talent shows\nProm night, tux and Kangol was so cool\nFuck them new model cars we ridin' old school (old school)\n\n[Hook: Keon Bryce]\nWe were tryin so hard\nHard to survive\nCause even though we were young\nWe had to stay strong\nNo matter what we went through\nIt was me and my crew\nAnd that's how it went\nWhen we were kids\n\n[Fate Wilson]\nIn 3 months we stayed in Jamestown\nHamwood and Diplomats\nPlayed with Transformers, G.I. Joe's and Thundercats\nWe was lovin' that\nBefore they started jackin jacks\nFor notes from Red Oaks had folks scared to come through\nCollege Park after dark, Crown Victorias police unmarked cars\nBe aware, Wayne Williams was out there, but we ain't care\nKids was gettin stabbed and ditched out there too busy playin\nDouble dare ya touch shorty on the ass, that's a bet\nWant your Kool-Aid and sugar, smack your hands and say \"sweat\"\nIt's mine now place it in my Louis Vuitton pouch\nThump a nigga on his knuckles make him say ouch\nSlouch socks, box Chevy Caprice\nHot Niss, cut da whole Disturbin' Tha Peace\nWit no conscience, broke niggas call 'em non cents\nNo comments, it's Lil' Fate payin homage to College Park\n\n[Hook: Keon Bryce]\nWe were tryin so hard\nHard to survive\nCause even though we were young\nWe had to stay strong\nNo matter what we went through\nIt was me and my crew\nAnd that's how it went\nWhen we were kids\n\n[Ludacris]\nI had a Long John but no Silver, no gold or plat\nI was simply red from the years I been holdin' back\nWith two sides to a book I lick stamps and light matches\nAnd set fires in garbage pails and cabbage patches\nA child of the corn been wild since I was born\nClimbin' over barbed wire, clothes got torn\nShoes got muddy and my clique turned cruddy\nWherever I go they went they my buddies\nI brush teeth, brush naps and calm streets\nDreamin' of Cadillacs, wood wheels and plush seats\nCats with gold teeth and raps with such beats\nMacks with no grief and some sacks of green leaf\nWhen I loaded my cap gun I was ready for action\nStarin' at beer cans and a moment to crack one\nWanna hang with the big boys and play with the big toys\nAnd be with the people makin all that got damn noise, man\n\n[Hook] - repeat 2X",

But really it just hit me\nThat three of yo' top 5's too scared to FUCK with me (woo!)\nSo how can I advance if you don't give me no opponents?

I mean how did he think of that?\nI mean how did I think of that? Now like a rental, bring it back\nI mean how did I think of that? I surprise myself sometimes\nSomeone should throw me a surprise party for every rhyme\nEvery time I do it, I do it dirty like swine\nFor the dirty and five, hip-hop, I'm alive!\n\n[Hook Two: Lil Wayne, Ludacris] {w/ scratches by DJ Jaycee}\nI'm a lyricist to the death and I got what you need\nWeezy F, the last of a dyin breed\nAnd we almost extinct, so I'm sayin it loud\nSay it with me MC means move the crowd (3x)\n{*scratches: \"M-MC means move, means move... m-move... move the crowd\"*}\n\n[Ludacris]\n(Aowwwww!)

repeated]\nYeah! Dedicated to all my hustlers that's a product of they environment\nWhether getting money legally or ILLEGALLY\nWe gotta do what we gotta do to survive man!\nYeah! Grew up a screw up baby\nGot introduced to the game, I ain't took a breath yet\nLet's go!\n\n[Ludacris]\nEver since I was an embryo, waiting to shape up and ship out\nSomething in my brain said, \"Wake up and kick out!\"\nRoberta and Wayne stayed up and flipped out\nCause when I came I was draped up and dripped out\nSnip the umbilical, spit the government chip out\nPeace up, A-Town down and then I dipped out\nAnd oh my gosh, the Osh Kosh was picked out\nI slipped in, even my baby stroller was tricked out\nSomebody get him, the little nigga's out of control\nPut a little bit of rum in my bottle I'll dream about diamonds and gold\nGold gold, to grow from an infant to toddler was effervescent\nThe essence of adolescence got my body feeling freshen\nFreshing freshing, and it was a blessing to rhyme and start rapping\nI was the best in my section with flows hard than erections\nStill the best but now I'm grown with more range than a Texan\nAnd I'm a heavyweight you niggas is lighter than my complexion\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Young Jeezy over the Hook]\nAyyyy\nY'all already know what it is\nI'mma tell you nigga\nC.T., know what it is, 'bout 17-5\n\n[Young Jeezy]\nHomey fronted me a zip, shit I made it a bird\nThat's seventeen and a half, all I need is the word\nSay the, ice is cool but them pots is hot\nYou better cook slow but that money come fast\nI got what you need I hope you brought all the cash\nYou know the kid pimping all over the world\nA hundred carats got me all over your girl\nYEAH, five bricks and my Gucci duffle bag\nA corporate thug, I run with a Playaz Circle\nI got a Field Mob that'll Disturb your Peace\nBlowing Sean Jay, all we do is smoke\nFinish counting my bread and I was getting some head\nWhat's up?\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Ludacris]\nI'mma be all the way real with this, look\nWhen I came into the game they ain't do nothing but doubt me\nNow the whole game's changed and it ain't nothing without me\nPicking up my sloppy seconds as they reach for the crown\nOnly reason you on that song is cause I turned that down\nI went from Hot Wheels to big wheels, Hyundais to Bentleys\nAnd five course meals, no more Popeye's and Blimpie's\nFrom alright to handsome, from one room to mansions\nFrom hanging on the block to throwing parties in the Hamptons\nFrom, broke as a joke to rich as a bitch, I bought a\nPlane and a boat and six other whips, no MARTA\nFrom dice on the curb to stacking up chips, but harder\nFrom birds on my nerves to chicks on my DICK! Guard your\nWomen dawg I went from ashy to classy\nWent from a, kiss on the cheek to doing the nasty\nReach your hand up in the air and you can play with the stars\nIt's not the hand that you're dealt but how you're playing your cards\nBoy!\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "Blueberry Yum Yum", "album": "The Red Light District", "year": "2004-12-07", "lyrics": "[Intro: Ludacris]\nYeah, uhh\nThink I'mma try

higher (let's get higher)\nGot that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (it's that fire)\nGet your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (let's get higher)\nGot that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (it's that fire)\n\n[Verse 1: Ludacris]\nGot a little bit of blueberry yum yum\nAnd I never woulda thought that it could taste this gooooooooood\nThank God for the man who put it in my hooooooood\nIt's got me singin melodies I never thought I woooooould\nI'm feelin sorry for the homies who be smokin woooooood\nChop chop, break it down for a player like ye ye ye ye..\nI'm 'bout to find me a woman and skeet skeet skeet skeet..\nI'mma keep smokin 'til I reach my peak peak peak peak..\nOr 'til I'm stuck and my body feels weak weak weak weak..\nHeaded down to the Dungeon, wonderin, if they got some mooooore\nAnd if they don't then I'mma haveta, settle fa, some 'droooooo\nBut it just ain't cool cause right on after, I'mma have-ta go\nAnd continue on my mission fishin for the yum yum but I'm movin slowwww\n\n[Hook: Sleepy Brown]\nGet your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (let's get higher)\nGot that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (it's that fire)\nGet your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (let's get higher)\nGot that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (it's that fire)\n\n[Verse 2: Ludacris]\nYes fire fire got me so tired, I'mma stop drop and rollllllll\nPut a wet towel under the doooooooooooor\nDon't pass it I can't take it no moooooooooooore\nSomebody take a trip down to the stoooooooore\nHurry please, cause I need some snacks snacks snacks snacks..\nAnd how long will it take it to get back back back back..?\nYes indeed, I'm a little off track track track track..\nOff this weed, and I'm full of that 'gnac 'gnac 'gnac 'gnac..\nGet on in that stankin Lincoln, crank it up, and riiide\nAnd it ain't enough room to fit the, other chicks, insiiiide\nI'm so hungry with the munchies I'mma eat eveyrthing, in siiight\nMe and my blueberries together and everything's, alriiiiight\n\n[Hook: Sleepy Brown]\nGet your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (let's get higher)\nGot that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (it's that fire)\nGet your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (let's get higher)\nGot that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (it's that fire)\n\n[Verse 3: Ludacris]\nGet the propane, roll dem thangs, and let's blow dis place uuuuuuuup\nYou already know what'suuuuuuuuuuuup\nI mighta had to pay some extra buuuuuuuucks\nBut I really don't give a fuuuuuuuuuuck\nCause a brother feels great great great great..\nBut I'm barely awake wake wake wake..\nAll bent out of shape shape shape shape..\nSo stomp on yo' brake brake brake brake..\nIf you tokin good then all the smokers, let me see, your flame\nDon't know what you got but my bag'll, put yo' stuff, to shame\nAll the different kinds and other flavors, they don't mean, a thang\nYou can't compare it don't stare cause I got the ultimate Mary Jane\n\n[Hook: Sleepy Brown]\nGet your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (let's get higher)\nGot that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (it's that fire)\nGet your lighters,

bridges can't be crossed\nLord won't you let me know\nOr give me one more reason to go\n\n[Verse 1: Ludacris]\nI done took all I could take from you\nNeed a little bit more than a break from you\nMatter of fact fuck you, don't need you in my life\nYou done did so much wrong I hope you get it right\nBut not at my expense, I did all I could do\nYou just took me for granted, you thought I was a fool\nWhen I did everything in my power to help and please you\nBut I don't know you no more, fuck it, I caught amnesia\nToo many emotions I try to bury\nBut the higher I climb, the less weight I'm trying to carry\nDem niggas holdin' on for dear life, bringin' me drama\nBut I'm only responsible for my daughters Cai and Karma\nNigga you's a grown man, get yourself together\nForget about the past, now's a better time than never\nMatter of fact, It's time to start making better decisions\nSo put your fires out, and stop burning 'Cris' bridges\nYou little bitches\n\n[Hook: Jason Aldean]\nWhen all your love is lost\nAnd burning bridges can't be crossed\nLord won't you let me know\nOr give me one more reason to go\n\n[Verse 2: Ludacris]\nYeah, this industry's full of bullshitters\nAnd all this time you thought you had me fooled niggas\nIn my ferrari partner thought he saw a spaceship\nCos I move in speed not to get caught up in this fake shit\nSmiling in my face when I'm around y'all\nBut soon as I leave, niggas be prayin' on my down fall\nIs it cause you'll never sell as many records?\nMy bitches always look better, you fail at business endeavours?\nOr that

little bit more than a break from you\nMatter of fact fuck you, don't need you in my life\nYou done did so much wrong I hope you get it right\nBut not at my expense, I did all I could do\nYou just took me for granted, you thought I was a fool\nWhen I did everything in my power to help and please you\nBut I don't know you no more, fuck it, I caught amnesia\nToo many emotions I try to bury\nBut the higher I climb, the less weight I'm trying to carry\nDem niggas holdin' on for dear life, bringin' me drama\nBut I'm only responsible for my daughters Cai and Karma\nNigga you's a grown man, get yourself together\nForget about the past, now's a better time than never\nMatter of fact, It's time to start making better decisions\nSo put your fires out, and stop burning 'Cris' bridges\nYou little bitches\n\n[Hook: Jason Aldean]\nWhen all your love is lost\nAnd burning bridges can't be crossed\nLord won't you let me know\nOr give me one more reason to go\n\n[Verse 2: Ludacris]\nYeah, this industry's full of bullshitters\nAnd all this time you thought you had me fooled niggas\nIn my ferrari partner thought he saw a spaceship\nCos I move in speed not to get caught up in this fake shit\nSmiling in my face when I'm around y'all\nBut soon as I leave, niggas be prayin' on my down fall\nIs it cause you'll never sell as many records?\nMy bitches always look better, you fail at business endeavours?\nOr that people thought you were clever, but now they know you stupid?\nAnd misery loves company now that you're going through it?\nSomebody tell these rappers I walk hard in these Louis\nSo get out of here, you don't want no part of this shit, Dewey\nI see them drugs got y'all trippin' too soon\nThat's why you find me in the club, every once in a blue moon\nSo while you

Ludacris]\nShake, shake, shake your money maker\nLike you were shaking it for some paper\nIt took your momma 9 months to make ya\nMight as well shake what your momma gave ya\nYou, you lookin' good in them jeans\nI bet you'd look even better with me in between\nI keep my mind on my money - money on my mind\nBut you's a hell of a distraction when you shake your behind\nI got J.O. up on my right side pourin' some cups\nMy whole hood is to my left and they ain't givin a fuck\nSo feel free to get loose and get carried away\nSo by tomorrow you forgot what you were saying today\nBut don't forget about this feeling that I am making you get\nAnd all the calories you burn from me making you sweat\nThe mile-high points you earn when we taking my jet and\nHow everywhere you turn I'll be making you wet cause you can\n\n[Hook: Pharrell & Ludacris]\nShake your money maker\nLike somebody's bout to pay ya\nI see you on my radar\nDon't you act like you're afraid of shit\nYou know I got it\nIf you wanna

ready again\nAnd you can invite over as many friends as\nYou want to but I really want you\nJust be thankful that Pharrell gave you something to bump to hey\nLuda - I'm at the top of my game\nYou want my hands from your bottom to the top of your frame\nAnd I - just wanna take a little ride on your curves\nAnd get erotic giving your body just what it deserves and\nLet me give you some swimming lessons on the penis\nBackstroke, breaststroke, stroke of a genius\nYepp call me the renaissance man get up and\nI stay harder then a cinderblock man\nHey I'm just a bedroom gangster\nAnd I've been meaning to tell that I really must thank ya when you\n\n[Hook: Pharrell & Ludacris]\nShake your money maker\nLike somebody's bout to pay ya\nI see you on my radar\nDon't you act like you're afraid of

in the air\nYou know I got it\nIf you wanna come get it\nStand next to this money\nLike - ey ey ey\n\n[Verse 3]\nRock rock, rock it an make it work, girl\nPlease don't stop it until it hurts, girl\nYou - you been looking a little tipsy\nSo if you could just shake it a little this way\nSee I'm a member of the BBC\nThe original breadwinner of DTP\nYou the center of attention that is distracting the squad\nCause everybody in the campus like - OH MY GOD she can\n\n[Hook: Pharrell & Ludacris]\nShake your money maker\nLike somebody's bout to pay ya\nI see you on my radar\nDon't you

Welcome to the United States of America! Time to roll out the red carpet on y'all bitch asses! Hailin from the filthy, dirty South, where the Kings lay: Ludacris; Disturbin' Tha Peace family.

Luda's oodles of noodles\nAnd testing me, is like pitbulls put up to poodles\nMy rap career goes back further than your father hairline\nIt's ludicrous - I pack more nuts than Delta Airlines\nI'm fly, even when I get high I work cash\nAnd even got my coach bumped up to first class\nI'm boss to all employees - and I'm here to teach the principle\nCause I've been saved by mo' bells than Lark Voorhies\n\n[Unnamed Man #2]\nMan fuck that nigga 'Cris man, for real man.

Recognize royalty when you hear it. The throne has been taken, so kiss this nigga's earring. Luda, throw some grapes on these peasants!\n\n[Ludacris]\nThese bitches throwin' rose petals at my feet mayne!\nThey wanna spoil me, treatin' me like royalty;\nWhat I'm 'sposed to do? It's such a sweet thang\nWork that track, whip 'em like Kunta\nThat's why they stay down, they loyal citizens of Zamunda\nBy way of A-T-L; if you disagree\nDon't even look at me ho don't pass go just go straight to jail\nWith no probation or bail, but this ain't Monopoly\nIt's Jolly Green Giants cause we smoke so much broccoli\nUh-oh, Spaghetti-O's! Luda's oodles of noodles\nAnd testing me, is like pitbulls put up to poodles\nMy rap career goes back further than your father hairline\nIt's ludicrous - I pack more nuts than Delta Airlines\nI'm fly, even when I get high I work cash\nAnd even got my coach bumped up to first class\nI'm boss to all employees - and I'm here to teach the principle\nCause I've been saved by mo' bells than Lark Voorhies\n\n[Unnamed Man #2]\nMan fuck that nigga 'Cris man, for real man.

Motherfuckers it's Poppa Bear\nStop and stare; pourin out a lil' gasoline and then drop a flare\nI'm on, FIRE! And you know I can't stop 'til I re-TIRE!\nOh no, we stay swoll, rollin on Vogue TIRES!\nRight down the avenue, passin you rapidly stackin\nIn the back of the Cadillac and packin emergency action\nCamera, LIGHT LIGHTS, throwin a punch and then FIGHT FIGHT\nPackin a lunch and then BITE BITE, A-T-L stay TIGHT TIGHT\n\n[Unnamed Man #4]\nI'm just tryin to save ya shorty! I'mma let you know it's real down heah! When you ride down that 285 and you go past Cascade, get ready to go past that Campbellton Road 'fore you get it to Camp Creek, shorty, just shake; cause dat where dem real niggas at!

Ha ha ha ha (Feel this)\nIt gets meaner and meaner each time baby\nFeelin real good too (holla at 'em man) What up Uncle 'Face! (Yeah)\nI'm a bull in this industry man (tell 'em)\nSome would rather run down and get one cow (nah)\nI think I'd rather walk down and get 'em all\nYou know what I'm talkin 'bout right? Look\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm never going nowhere so don't try me\nMy music sticks in fans' veins like an IV\nFlows poison like Ivy, oh they grimy\nAlready offers on my 6th album from labels tryin to sign me\nRespected highly, \"Hi, Mr. O'Reilly!\"\nHope all is well, kiss the plaintiff and the wifey\nDrove through the window, the industry super sized me\nNow the girls see me and a river's what they cry me\nI'm on the rise, so many people despise me\nGot party ammunition for those tryin to surprise me (surprise!)\nIt's a celebration and everyone should invite me\nRoll with the crew or meet the bottom of our Nikes (blaow!)\nExplorer like Dora these swipers can't swipe me\nMy whole aura's so MEAN in my white tee\nNobody light-skinned did reppin harder since Ice-T\nYou disagree, take the Tyson approach and bite me!\n\n[Hook]\nWhoa!

(What you doin' man?)\nI'm comin' for that number one spot!\n\n[Verse 2]\nYes indeed, Ludacris I'm hotter than Nevada\nReady to break the steerin' column on yo' Impala\nIf I get caught, bail out, po'-po' I tell 'em holla\nIn court I never show up, like Austin Powers fa-zha\nFather, father, and hey I love gold\nBut can buy anything I want from the records I've sold\nJacuzzi's hot, Cristal is so cold\nNeighbors catch contacts, from the blunts that I've rolled\nA pig in a blanket, a smoke and a pancake\nDrop albums non-stop once a year for my fans sake\nI crush mics until my hand breaks\nThen shag now and shag later 'til these women can't stand straight\nThe Luda-meister got 'em feelin so randy\nI'm +XXL+ so I call 'em my +Eye Candy+\nBrush my shoulder and I, pop my collar\nCause I'm worth a million ga-zillion fa-fillion dollars\n\n[Hook]\nWhoa!

right to it\nLuda!\n\n[Verse 1]\nAin't nobody fuckin' with me when it come to getting lyrical\nMurdering the rapper and killing beats nigga\nI'm cinematic making everybody panic\nI be bustin' like a fully automatic feel the heat nigga!\nWe can battle in the Phantom in Atlanta the rover in Minnesota or the Arizona streets nigga\nThey sayin' all these offensive lines I snapback it's the quarterback sneak nigga!\nOne time for the sneak dissers Ol' puss ass fuckboys say my name!\nAnybody coming at me know I never back down killing a rapper is my claim to fame!\nYou lame\nAnd my flow is what expose in these hoes even on a nigga worst day\nThey say Luda don't want it no mo'\nNo nigga I'm as hungry as the first day\nWhat you want how you want it you can get I'm the definition of a real g from the south side\nThe crime scene be the studio get the yellow tape and the chalk and I'm leaving everybody outline\nI'm all about mine\nGetting paid getting laid getting clothes getting hoes getting green back\nUsed be like everybody is a lil kid now Big Boy,  outcast like three stacks\nLaying all it in the Cadillac with a red bone giving me dome my music on with the seats back\nLudacris this is album number 8 and my pockets gonna be straight\nEven if a nigga leak that\nTimmy all up on the David Banner track with Janet Jack in the back like \"Damn Luda freak that!\"\nBreak it down like you dropping to the ground but we like the 808 in Atlanta so bring the beat back\nSample had to eat that\nCouldn't control alt or delete that\nBut put any other rapper on the track and I guarantee they'll never know how to treat that\nI'm a boss I'm a king I'm a legend Imma drill it in your head till you doze off\nAnd I just so happen to be the type of rapper that make your women want to take her clothes off\nSo let's get to the action\nLet's get to the show\nI'm been getting to the Forbes list six year straight let's get to the do'\nShout out to the Luda Nation\nAll my fans just got live\nAnd they waitin' for everybody to put me in the rapper category of ya top five\n\n[Instrumental Bridge]\n\nLet me get it back\n\n[Verse 2]\nEver since I\nCame in the game it ain't never been the same\nCan't nobody do it like me\nIs it ever gonna be another Luda you know that'll never happen that's highly unlikely\nKnowing that I'm better than everybody you put me up against I'm in the hall of fame\nSo fuck call to call we can go bar for bar I'll put your name up on the wall of shame\nAnd everyday is the same thing\nLooking for another way for me to make paper\nI think it's time for every single rapper to go to church\nWhoever is my opponent you better pray first\nThey like \"Luda why you rapping so fast?\"\nI'm like \"Bitch why you listen too slow?\"\nI'm the truth in the booth and they can't keep up hardly cause I always hit em with a new flow\nAnd the two door with the coup low with the Hublot off the window with the two low blades from the top like judo listening to bruno on the way to school though getting kudos from a few hoes and they from the choose though\nCuz I'm numero uno and the crew know it's a couple loop holes when it come to fluke hoes cuz some of they pussy bite like Cujo\nBut back to the you know who\nI can't stop till you tell me I'm the greatest\nIf you need a reminder then put the whole song on repeat and continue to play this\nBetter turn your stereo louder\nListen up and let me preach\nAnd let's get arrested for disturbing the peace\n\n[Outro]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/62819740802d113d74cdf35e32db7990.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist":

to it\nLuda!\n\n[Verse 1]\nAin't nobody fuckin' with me when it come to getting lyrical\nMurdering the rapper and killing beats nigga\nI'm cinematic making everybody panic\nI be bustin' like a fully automatic feel the heat nigga!\nWe can battle in the Phantom in Atlanta the rover in Minnesota or the Arizona streets nigga\nThey sayin' all these offensive lines I snapback it's the quarterback sneak nigga!\nOne time for the sneak dissers Ol' puss ass fuckboys say my name!\nAnybody coming at me know I never back down killing a rapper is my claim to fame!\nYou lame\nAnd my flow is what expose in these hoes even on a nigga worst day\nThey say Luda don't want it no mo'\nNo nigga I'm as hungry as the first day\nWhat you want how you want it you can get I'm the definition of a real g from the south side\nThe crime scene be the studio get the yellow tape and the chalk and I'm leaving everybody outline\nI'm all about mine\nGetting paid getting laid getting clothes getting hoes getting green back\nUsed be like everybody is a lil kid now Big Boy,  outcast like three stacks\nLaying all it in the Cadillac with a red bone giving me dome my music on with the seats back\nLudacris this is album number 8 and my pockets gonna be straight\nEven if a nigga leak that\nTimmy all up on the David Banner track with Janet Jack in the back like \"Damn Luda freak that!\"\nBreak it down like you dropping to the ground but we like the 808 in Atlanta so bring the beat back\nSample had to eat that\nCouldn't control alt or delete that\nBut put any other rapper on the track and I guarantee they'll never know how to treat that\nI'm a boss I'm a king I'm a legend Imma drill it in your head till you doze off\nAnd I just so happen to be the type of rapper that make your women want to take her clothes off\nSo let's get to the action\nLet's get to the show\nI'm been getting to the Forbes list six year straight let's get to the do'\nShout out to the Luda Nation\nAll my fans just got live\nAnd they waitin' for everybody to put me in the rapper category of ya top five\n\n[Instrumental Bridge]\n\nLet me get it back\n\n[Verse 2]\nEver since I\nCame in the game it ain't never been the same\nCan't nobody do it like me\nIs it ever gonna be another Luda you know that'll never happen that's highly unlikely\nKnowing that I'm better than everybody you put me up against I'm in the hall of fame\nSo fuck call to call we can go bar for bar I'll put your name up on the wall of shame\nAnd everyday is the same thing\nLooking for another way for me to make paper\nI think it's time for every single rapper to go to church\nWhoever is my opponent you better pray first\nThey like \"Luda why you rapping so fast?\"\nI'm like \"Bitch why you listen too slow?\"\nI'm the truth in the booth and they can't keep up hardly cause I always hit em with a new flow\nAnd the two door with the coup low with the Hublot off the window with the two low blades from the top like judo listening to bruno on the way to school though getting kudos from a few hoes and they from the choose though\nCuz I'm numero uno and the crew know it's a couple loop holes when it come to fluke hoes cuz some of they pussy bite like Cujo\nBut back to the you know who\nI can't stop till you tell me I'm the greatest\nIf you need a reminder then put the whole song on repeat and continue to play this\nBetter turn your stereo louder\nListen up and let me preach\nAnd let's get arrested for disturbing the peace\n\n[Outro]"}}, {"title": "I Do It for Hip Hop", "album": "Theater of the Mind", "year": "2008-11-24", "lyrics":

emotion\nIt's my daily devotion, the verses stay deeper than the ocean\nSo hip-hop you owe me a promotion!\nYeah I do a little boastin and braggin\nWhat's all the commotion and naggin about? Cause I'm still the champ in the South?\nCause rappers get in the booth and I keep draggin em out?\nWell they're fired, and these pink slips, I'm handin em out\nCause this is \"Theater of the Mind,\" consider it a sign\nOf what's to come next, my money's just fine\nBank filled with dumb checks, terrorist threat flow\nProceed to drop bombs like Mr. Funk Flex\nBut I don't do it for the money, I do it from the heart\nI do it with the beat box, I did it from the start\nI do it for the dee jays, I do it for the charts\nThe Van Gogh flow, Luda do it cause it's art\nI do it for the fans, I do it on command\nI do it for the front row, I do it for the stands\nI spit it for the hood, I do it for the block\nAnd since nine years old I did it for hip-hop, so\n\n[Hook 1: Ludacris]\nI don't do it for them cars and the fancy drops\nI do it for hip-hop\nI do it for hip-hop\nI do it for hip-hop\nAnd I don't it for the chains and the flashin rocks\nI do it for hip-hop\nI do it for hip-hop\nI do it for hip-hop\n\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nUhh, uhh, uh\nThey say I'm so low key, I'm socially awkward\nOnly niggas who really know me, who I talk with\nThey smile in the light, hate in the dark\nYou call it beef, to me, it's just a fuckin walk in the park\nCause you are who you are when nobody's lookin\nThat's who you are, so when the cash and the cars is gone\nThe day after tomorrow, don't be askin to borrow\nSki mask it hard, like the way you rap in your bars\nI can ride on you and whoever, devise new endeavors\nI'm as live as a hive full of predators\nTwenty thousand different species of bees\nSome have poisonous stings, some just pollen their leaves\nIt's like rap, some just buzz, some will attack\nCompromise their own life in fact\nSixteen years since my first sixteen\nPardon the rest of my niggas... but I'm the best who's ever did it!\n\n[Hook 2: Ludacris) & Nas](I don\u2019t do for the cars and the fancy drops)\nUh, I doit for hip-hop\nYeah, I do it for hip-hop\nUh (I do it for hip-hop)\n(And I don\u2019t do for the chains and the flashin\u2019 rocks)\nWhy we do it kid?

the fuck off my back while I knocked off these packs\nI used to rap to impress my friends\nTo pass the time while I was gettin' it in\nJust so happens, I'm so illegal with the pen\nThey ain't want me doin' anything illegal again\nI lost a lot of dogs to these streets\nI got Grammy Awards on these beats\nThank God for Kool Herc\nWithout your shit I probably would've got murked\nShout out to Grandmaster Flash and to Caz\nAnd even Jaz bum-ass\nHip-hop helped me wash my rocks\nThese other rappers couldn't wash my socks\nThat's why I took the number one slot\nThe realest shit in rap comes from my voice box\nLord knows when I was on my clock\nI prolly never woulda stopped, thank God for hip-hop\n\n[Hook Three: Ludacris] + (Jay-Z) + {Both}\nI don\u2019t do for the cars and the fancy

screams with emotion\nIt's my daily devotion, the verses stay deeper than the ocean\nSo hip-hop you owe me a promotion!\nYeah I do a little boastin and braggin\nWhat's all the commotion and naggin about? Cause I'm still the champ in the South?\nCause rappers get in the booth and I keep draggin em out?\nWell they're fired, and these pink slips, I'm handin em out\nCause this is \"Theater of the Mind,\" consider it a sign\nOf what's to come next, my money's just fine\nBank filled with dumb checks, terrorist threat flow\nProceed to drop bombs like Mr. Funk Flex\nBut I don't do it for the money, I do it from the heart\nI do it with the beat box, I did it from the start\nI do it for the dee jays, I do it for the charts\nThe Van Gogh flow, Luda do it cause it's art\nI do it for the fans, I do it on command\nI do it for the front row, I do it for the stands\nI spit it for the hood, I do it for the block\nAnd since nine years old I did it for hip-hop, so\n\n[Hook 1: Ludacris]\nI don't do it for them cars and the fancy drops\nI do it for hip-hop\nI do it for hip-hop\nI do it for hip-hop\nAnd I don't it for the chains and the flashin rocks\nI do it for hip-hop\nI do it for hip-hop\nI do it for hip-hop\n\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nUhh, uhh, uh\nThey say I'm so low key, I'm socially awkward\nOnly niggas who really know me, who I talk with\nThey smile in the light, hate in the dark\nYou call it beef, to me, it's just a fuckin walk in the park\nCause you are who you are when nobody's lookin\nThat's who you are, so when the cash and the cars is gone\nThe day after tomorrow, don't be askin to borrow\nSki mask it hard, like the way you rap in your bars\nI can ride on you and whoever, devise new endeavors\nI'm as live as a hive full of predators\nTwenty thousand different species of bees\nSome have poisonous stings, some just pollen their leaves\nIt's like rap, some just buzz, some will attack\nCompromise their own life in fact\nSixteen years since my first sixteen\nPardon the rest of my niggas... but I'm the best who's ever did it!\n\n[Hook 2: Ludacris) & Nas](I don\u2019t do for the cars and the fancy drops)\nUh, I doit for hip-hop\nYeah, I do it for hip-hop\nUh (I do it for hip-hop)\n(And I don\u2019t do for the chains and the flashin\u2019 rocks)\nWhy we do it kid? I do it for hip-hop\nYeah, I do it for hip-hop\nUh, I do it for hip-hop\n\n[Jay-Z]\nHip-hop, started out in the park\nWe used to do it to avoid the Narcs\nI used to do it so the homeboy Clark\nCan get the fuck off my back while I knocked off these packs\nI used to rap to impress my friends\nTo pass the time while I was gettin' it in\nJust so happens, I'm so illegal with the pen\nThey ain't want me doin' anything illegal again\nI lost a lot of dogs to these streets\nI got Grammy Awards on these beats\nThank God for Kool Herc\nWithout your shit I probably would've got murked\nShout out to Grandmaster Flash and to Caz\nAnd even Jaz bum-ass\nHip-hop helped me wash my rocks\nThese other rappers couldn't wash my socks\nThat's why I took the number one slot\nThe realest shit in rap comes from my voice box\nLord knows when I was on my clock\nI prolly never woulda stopped, thank God for hip-hop\n\n[Hook Three: Ludacris] + (Jay-Z) + {Both}\nI don\u2019t do for the cars and the fancy drops\n(Uh, I do it for hip-hop)\n(I do it for hip-hop)\nI do it for hip-hop\nAnd I don\u2019t do for the chains and the flashin\u2019 rocks\n(Come on, I do it for hip-hop)\n(I do it for hip-hop)\n{I do it for hip-hop}\n\n{*DJ scratches and Ludacris ad-libs until 4:56*}\n\n[Hook 1: Ludacris]\nI don't do it for them cars and the fancy drops\nI do it for hip-hop\nI do it for hip-hop\nI do it for hip-hop\nAnd I don't it for the chains and the flashin rocks\nI do it for hip-hop\nI do it for hip-hop\nI do it for hip-hop"}}, {"title": "Pussy Poppin (P-Poppin)", "album": "Chicken-n-Beer", "year": "2003-06-11", "lyrics": "One more again head down pussy poppin on a handstand\n\n[Hook]\nHead down pussy pussy poppin\nHead down pussy pussy poppin\nHead down pussy pussy poppin\nHead down pussy poppin on a handstand\n\n[Verse 1: Ludacris]\nOn a handstand\nOn my american banstands\nSummersalts cartwheels bitch just keep on dancing\nChinese splits-splits slide on down that pole-pole\nAnd feel this dick getin outa control-trol\nOh no keep goin till a nigga like me say stoooop\nLet it kiss the sky and then make it droooop\nTuck and twist if you don\u2019t like it you can fuckin Cris\nIm rubbin clits so stay in catch don\u2019t try to duck and miss\n(Bitch!)

started missing them groupies\nStop drinking for a year and I was all sober\nNext year I got drunk and did it all over\nYesterday I quit smoking and swore I had enough\nTill I smelt it in the club and had to take a puff\nI got rich and learned life was a bitch\nNow everybody's after all of my ends\n(Get yo hand out my pocket!)\nWhen I was broke all love from my folks\nBut nowadays I'm losing all of my friends let the story begin\n\n[Hook]\nThe grass is always greener on the other side\nAlways searching for another high\nThe grass is always greener on the other side\nCaterpillar to a butterfly\nThe grass is always greener on the other side\nAlways searching for another high\nThe grass is always greener on the other side\nCaterpillar to a butterfly\n\nBye bye butterfly\nFly away\nBye bye butterfly\nFly away\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah\nStart exercising and winning got me a six pack\nWas eating healthy and did away with the junk\nThen I got lazy and started to wanna kick back\nMy six pack reverted back to a gut\nWhen I'm at the crib I'm mad I'm not at the club lit\nWhen I'm at the club I'm mad I'm not at the crib\nI used to be out partying every damn night\nNow sometimes I'd rather be with my kids\nI got checks gained a lot of respect now everywhere I go they holla my name (Luda!)\nBut sometimes wish that I was disguised for peace of mind over fortune and fame\nGuess what I'm really saying is\n\n[Hook]\nThe grass is always greener on the other side\nAlways searching for another high\nThe grass is always greener on the other side\nCaterpillar to a butterfly\nThe grass is always greener on the other side\nAlways searching for another high\nThe grass is always greener on the other side\nCaterpillar to a butterfly\n\nBye bye butterfly\nFly away\nBye bye butterfly\nFly away\n\n[Verse 3]\nYeah\nLast year got the Ferrari that I always wanted\nDrove it crazy got sick of it had to trade (Give me my Ac'!)\nAll my fans convinced me to grow my hair back\nGrew it back then started missing my fade\nI got hits start trippin' I wasn't underground\nGot underground start trippin' I need hits (We outta here!)\nWhen you down and people give you the runaround\nBut feels great to know who really gives a shit\nYou cut the grass and the snakes will show\nAnd know your neighbor's fertilizer is fake (Don't let it fool ya!)\nWe always searching for what we never had\nAlways ignoring what's in front of our face\nWe've been conditioned to think\n\n[Hook]\nThe grass is always greener on the other side\nAlways searching for another high\nThe grass is always greener on the other side\nCaterpillar to a butterfly\nThe grass is always greener on the other side\nAlways searching for another high\nThe grass is always greener on the other side\nCaterpillar to a

(Alright)\nAnd a nigga who ain't thinking 'bout a Trina LP\nAnd I'll make him go and get my shit\nWe can go from a fly ass jetta to a Coupe De Ville\nHotel tally ho or the Beverly Hill\nA real nigga not the run of the mill\nCome and spank me and make me shoot to kill\nFrom the kitchen then you can move me\nTo the jacuzzi and out the booty\nCome and do your duty\nMe and fat dick Ludacris making us a movie\nBare naked in a bed of cash\nMake st-st-sttutter when I bare my ass\nTell your baby momma bye, she a thing of the past\nCause I'm a bad bitch and I'm off the glass (Okay)\nHaving sex in lil' jets menag\u00e9 tois\nGetting buck wild no matter where we are\nIndie 500 in the back of the car\nIn a dark ass club or on the back of a bar\nNever want, never ever wanna leave\nWork for me like league overseas\nI want a man to fulfill my needs\nTo keep my body trembling and buckle my knees\n\n[Chorus: Ludacris & Shawna]\nI wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes\nAnd I wanna move

can you handle me?\nI wanna do it all in your mouth\nThen I'll pull the ass out\nMake it bounce 'til you pass out\nOr we can cut up in the grass\nAnd give the neighbors a flash\nCan you tell me who the bad motherfucker now?\nSaid I wanna take-ta-take-take a nigga back to the crib\nAnd I wanna do all the things, do all the things that I never did\nLike up on the top-to-top-top of the projects getting head\nOr you can find me in a dro-drop-drop-drop on dubs in the candy red\nI like a nigga when he face down, mouth wide\nPolo down with them blades on the ride\nKeepin' the pound with them K's on the side\nBut it's okay I'm gon break something tonight\nOh see get on your knees\nAnd I'll show you what's my fantasy\nLike up in the coupe, coupe\nTell your bitch she ain't gotta be mad at

Truth", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "[Lucidious: Verse 1]\n\nYeah\nCan I ever really find a way to let go of you\nI been thinking about it every time that I'm in a booth\nTry to put together everything that we do\nEvery step we take is away from the truth\n\nWhat's the point of a relationship\nIf every other day we gotta save that shit\nIt\u2019s gotta be love, thought we found it\nShip has been sinking we both have been drowning\n\nAll the hatred that we been allowing\nAll the alcohol that we been downing\nAfraid to commit but afraid to let go I'm alone I can feel all the demons surrounding\n\nBeen a while since I recognized\nWho I see when I look in my eyes\nTrying to breathe but the more that I try\nMore that I suffocate dying inside\n\nTried to be different we both tried to listen I'm sorry that I had to leave you behind\nAll of the bitching was causing division I had to let go I was losing my mind\n\nLocked in a prison got lost in the vision of somehow believing that we would be fine\nMade the decision to leave this position and put all my pain in the faith of divine (faith of divine, faith of divine)\n\n[Pre-Hook]\n\nAll we can take is one day at a time\nBe patient and open to seeing the signs\nLove is a war that you might not survive\n\nHappiness is what I hope you will find when you feeling the vibe and you meet the right guy\nThought it was me, but it wasn't our time\nStill I\u2019ll love you till the day that I die (day that I die, day that I die)\n\n[Xavier Frye: HOOK]\n\nTook it too fast but we were taking it slow\nHang on tight or we can let it go\nWe can surrender and just move on\nWe can be stubborn because we are strong\n\nWe can pretend that what we both know ain\u2019t true\nI don\u2019t mind it and neither do you\nNothing to gain just something to prove\nWe can try this love again or face the truth\n\n[Lucidious: Verse 2]\n\nI wish I could stay here to be your protection\nLoving myself is what I been neglecting\nThe most difficult part is the patience\nWhile taking in all of these changes\n\nI don't mean to be acting evasive\nI'm pretending I don't wanna face this\nI get sick to my stomach when I think about someone else touching you now I'm anxious\n\nAll I got left is a picture of us\nAll because we had broken the trust\nBeen working on gaining it back for a year, but the spark has been missing it turned into dust\n\nMiss the high that I got from your touch\nBoth of us felt an adrenaline rush\nCo-dependent treated you like a crutch\nMy heart was stolen & brutally crushed\n\nQuestion is will I ever know\nWhat we we could have been if I let you go\nIf I need to walk this path alone\nAll on my own cause I need to grow\n\nFuck, I'm sick of this\nFeeling like a mother fucking hypocrite\nMade a lot of mistakes I gotta live with it\nFind a way to let it go and be indifferent\nQuit talking (quit talking, quit talking)\n\n[Pre-Hook]\n\nAll we can take is one day at a time\nBe patient and open to seeing the signs\nLove is a war that you might not survive\n\nHappiness is what I hope you will find when you feeling the vibe and you meet the right guy\nThought it was me, but it wasn't our time\nStill I\u2019ll love you till the day that I die (day that I die, day that I die)\n\n[Xavier Frye: HOOK]\n\nTook it too fast but we were taking it slow\nHang on tight or we can let it go\nWe can surrender and just move on\nWe can be stubborn because we are strong\n\nWe can pretend that what we both know ain\u2019t true\nI don\u2019t mind it and neither do you\nNothing to gain just something to prove\nWe can try this love again or face the truth", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d211edacb8de02968540124c6801063d.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Ludacris", "raw": {"annotation_count": 1,

really find a way to let go of you\nI been thinking about it every time that I'm in a booth\nTry to put together everything that we do\nEvery step we take is away from the truth\n\nWhat's the point of a relationship\nIf every other day we gotta save that shit\nIt\u2019s gotta be love, thought we found it\nShip has been sinking we both have been drowning\n\nAll the hatred that we been allowing\nAll the alcohol that we been downing\nAfraid to commit but afraid to let go I'm alone I can feel all the demons surrounding\n\nBeen a while since I recognized\nWho I see when I look in my eyes\nTrying to breathe but the more that I try\nMore that I suffocate dying inside\n\nTried to be different we both tried to listen I'm sorry that I had to leave you behind\nAll of the bitching was causing division I had to let go I was losing my mind\n\nLocked in a prison got lost in the vision of somehow believing that we would be fine\nMade the decision to leave this position and put all my pain in the faith of divine (faith of divine, faith of divine)\n\n[Pre-Hook]\n\nAll we can take is one day at a time\nBe patient and open to seeing the signs\nLove is a war that you might not survive\n\nHappiness is what I hope you will find when you feeling the vibe and you meet the right guy\nThought it was me, but it wasn't our time\nStill I\u2019ll love you till the day that I die (day that I die, day that I die)\n\n[Xavier Frye: HOOK]\n\nTook it too fast but we were taking it slow\nHang on tight or we can let it go\nWe can surrender and just move on\nWe can be stubborn because we are strong\n\nWe can pretend that what we both know ain\u2019t true\nI don\u2019t mind it and neither do you\nNothing to gain just something to prove\nWe can try this love again or face the truth\n\n[Lucidious: Verse 2]\n\nI wish I could stay here to be your protection\nLoving myself is what I been neglecting\nThe most difficult part is the patience\nWhile taking in all of these changes\n\nI don't mean to be acting evasive\nI'm pretending I don't wanna face this\nI get sick to my stomach when I think about someone else touching you now I'm anxious\n\nAll I got left is a picture of us\nAll because we had broken the trust\nBeen working on gaining it back for a year, but the spark has been missing it turned into dust\n\nMiss the high that I got from your touch\nBoth of us felt an adrenaline rush\nCo-dependent treated you like a crutch\nMy heart was stolen & brutally crushed\n\nQuestion is will I ever know\nWhat we we could have been if I let you go\nIf I need to walk this path alone\nAll on my own cause I need to grow\n\nFuck, I'm sick of this\nFeeling like a mother fucking hypocrite\nMade a lot of mistakes I gotta live with it\nFind a way to let it go and be indifferent\nQuit talking

that he the leader, come follow my tribe today\nI fucked her now he heated, he feel some type of way\nDon't know how to say, ain't the hardest man working?\nAttention we pay, there's always a man lurking\nNo man perfect, but God\nMy head, I nod\nRich, homie, ugn...\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Rich Homie Quan]\nMy niggas been hustlin' trying to make him something\nAin't no telling what he'll do for the

about gaining\nNew friends and X-ing our exes\nIn the back of my mind\nI just wanted to sex this\nGotta give her the D\nAnd some pearls as her necklace\nSo, I had her for dinner\nWoke her up for breakfast\nAround seven thirteen like Houston, Texas\nShe\u2019s everything I hoped for in the bedroom\nAnd like Tyra Banks, I need some headroom\nBecause she can suck a golf ball through a garden hose\nI never sat her on the bench, she my starting hose\nI'm on point at Game time\nY\u2019all be guardin' hoes\nYeah, she never plays games like the Parker bros\nAnd we be drinking Conjure by the cases\nMeanwhile your girl\u2019s been exchanging fuck faces\n\n[Hook: Trey Songz]\nYou must be used to all the finer things\nInfatuated by what money brings\nIt seems to me, you hoes'll never change\n(Hoes won't ever change..)\nSo all that\u2019s left is for us to exchange..\n\n[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]\nI met her at a restaurant\nShe was a waitress\nOne day I went in and sat at her table\nShe asked me what will I be having?\nI said \"the basics\nWell-done steak, vegetables and potatoes\u201d\nShe asked if I will be having a drink, I said \"later\"\nBring me a glass of vodka and a chaser\nAs me and my homie sat and discussed paper\nI could feel a fire burning me like a laser\nI could see her thighs\nThrough uniform pants, so I didn\u2019t leave a tip\nI left her an advance\nAlong with my number saying \"give me a call\"\nAnd you know I didn\u2019t have to leave my name at all!\nShe called me when she got off\nSo I invited her to my loft\nAnd she flew over like a moth thing\nYou know she came straight up outta all of that cloth\nWe had a couple blunts and some champagne\nThen she massaged all of my back pains\nThen it became time for her to pack things\nI said hit me up again, we do the same thing\nJumped in the shower, got out and saw a text message\nIt had a smiley face and said \u201cyou the best sexy XOXO!\u201d\nI replied I love your fuck face\n\n[Trey Songz]\nYou must be used to all the finer things\nInfatuated by what money brings\nIt seems to me you hoes will never change\n(Hoes won't ever change)\nSo all that\u2019s left is for us to exchange",

"[Verse 1: Ludacris]\nI met this chick in Motor City\nAnd her name was Lexus\nAss out of control and her chest was wreckless\nSo we exchanged numbers\nPlenty calls and texts about gaining\nNew friends and X-ing our exes\nIn the back of my mind\nI just wanted to sex this\nGotta give her the D\nAnd some pearls as her necklace\nSo, I had her for dinner\nWoke her up for breakfast\nAround seven thirteen like Houston, Texas\nShe\u2019s everything I hoped for in the bedroom\nAnd like Tyra Banks, I need some headroom\nBecause she can suck a golf ball through a garden hose\nI never sat her on the bench, she my starting hose\nI'm on point at Game time\nY\u2019all be guardin' hoes\nYeah, she never plays games like the Parker bros\nAnd we be drinking Conjure by the cases\nMeanwhile your girl\u2019s been exchanging fuck faces\n\n[Hook: Trey Songz]\nYou must be used to all the finer things\nInfatuated by what money brings\nIt seems to me, you hoes'll never change\n(Hoes won't ever change..)\nSo all that\u2019s left is for us to exchange..\n\n[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]\nI met her at a restaurant\nShe was a waitress\nOne day I went in and sat at her table\nShe asked me what will I be having?\nI said \"the basics\nWell-done steak, vegetables and potatoes\u201d\nShe asked if I will be having a drink, I said \"later\"\nBring me a glass of vodka and a chaser\nAs me and my homie sat and discussed paper\nI could feel a fire burning me like a laser\nI could see her thighs\nThrough uniform pants, so I didn\u2019t leave a tip\nI left her an advance\nAlong with my number saying \"give me a call\"\nAnd you know I didn\u2019t have to leave my name at all!\nShe called me when she got off\nSo I invited her to my loft\nAnd she flew over like a moth thing\nYou know she came straight up outta all of that cloth\nWe had a couple blunts and some champagne\nThen she massaged all of my back pains\nThen it became time for her to pack things\nI said hit me up again, we do the same thing\nJumped in the shower, got out and saw a text message\nIt had a smiley face and said \u201cyou the best sexy XOXO!\u201d\nI replied I love your fuck face\n\n[Trey Songz]\nYou must be used to all the finer things\nInfatuated by what money brings\nIt seems to me you hoes will never change\n(Hoes won't ever change)\nSo all that\u2019s left is for us to exchange"}}, {"title": "Undisputed", "album":

down\nCause you the truth, it's round one\nDedication, hard work, prayers and belief\nAnd a good team {*ding ding*}\n\n[Verse 1: Ludacris]\nYeah, back up on that ass (yeah)\nBack to put rappers on one knee like they 'bout to run 100 meter dash\nBow down to greatness\nBefore I get pissed and run up in the stands like the Indiana Pacers\nCovered all my bases, straight, no chasers\nDiamonds on my chain look like my neck's full of glaciers\nTitanic flow (what?) Titanic dough (what?)\nWomen on my nuts like, \"Where the Titanic go?!\"\nI been scourin the Earth (yeah)\nMakin my fans catch the holy ghost at my shows like ya grandma at church\nAnd the fat lady's singin - it's over for you rappers\nCan't none of y'all bust, you're just sacs full of semen\nAnd I got the women screamin (AHHH!)\nThey could catch my balls on Any Given Sunday like my name's Willie Beamen\nOr LL Cool - so if your boyfriend\nThinks you loyal to his ass then he's a motherfuckin fool\nGot jewels on my pinky, jewels on my wrist (hey!)\nIconic status and his name is Ludacris\nBitch please! You messin with some real O.G.'s\nWith million dollar whips that I ship from overseas\nGot a pocket full of G's - and the inconvenient truth\nIs that the ozone is bad cause I been smokin' all the trees\nThe globe is warmin up when we fire up the blunt\nAnd put it in the air like Evel Knievel stunts\nWhat you want from me? (what?) I got pistols for the haters\nYour fam'll be in black like they was playin for the Raiders\nAnd your music isn't favored - and DJ's they NEVER bring it back\nLike when you go and borrow somethin from your neighbors\nLike a cup full of sugar, a rope full of salt\nThe name of my car insurance is \"YO' FUCKIN FAULT!\"\nAnd if you sittin' on chrome - I'll call up my boys\nAnd have you stripped of yo' metals like Marion Jones, nigga\n\n[Interlude: Floyd Mayweather Jr.] + (Ludacris)\nChamp you got it! Keep on movin\nThey ain't got nothin on you, watch for the sneak dissin\nThese boys'll smile in your face and stab you right in the back (I know)\nBring it, take some water\nThis is Money in the bank! (yeah)\nThey defeatin themselves, champ (yeah baby)\nYou know what you can do (I know)\nYou Luda! You lookin good, let's go! (aight)\nC'mon baby, hard work and dedication (yeah)\nYou know what it is man (aight let's go)\n{*ding ding ding*} Keep fightin!\n\n[Verse 2: Ludacris]\nYeah, back up on the scene (what?)\nBack to put a nail in these rappers' coffins\nI got the hammer in my jeans: call me Mr. Fix It\nBarrel stay hotter than\nA fresh batch of homemade buttermilk biscuits\nA-tisket, a-tasket, a custom-made casket\nLuda leaves intruders stretched out like gymnastics\nAnd acrobatics; I'm superstar status\nThe mouth of the South like Gangsta Grillz you bastards!\nThe international traveler\nAnd I may not be much to you, but I'm the SHIT out in Africa\nSo put ya fist up - even the Statue of Liberty\nLit a flame for the way that I lit my wrist up\nYou can't compete with me - I got 'em stuck\nLike I made a thousand rappers put shackles on they feet with me\nAnd then I broke free - I'll let 'em loose\nWhen Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston become drug-free\nI'm the baddest mother-shut-it like Shaft was\nLeavin' rappers with headaches like bad drugs\nThey shoulda warned ya - you got defeated\nBy the Heat, but ehh, we'll just say we Alonzo Mourn'd ya\nSo call the coroner (hey!)\nI'll show up to yo' funeral with some gators like I'm FRESH outta Florida\nCall me The Swamp Thang - y'all headed in the wrong direction\nLike you hit the subway and caught the wrong train\nSo don't fuck with it - I'm sendin' lyrical bullets\nRight at yo' dome, fuck niggas better duck with it (duck wit it!)\nOr else you stuck with it - you'll get stomped so bad\nYou'll leave the scene thinkin eight Young Buck's did it\nBut not in Ca$hville - you lost yo' feelin\nLike comin' down off X, chasin' effects of yo last pill (ha ha)\nYou fuckin' Daffodil, you's a Daffy Duck (what?)\nAnd I'm the undefeated champ, y'all niggas suck!\n\n[Interlude: Floyd Mayweather Jr.]\nHa ha ha ha!\nI told these muh'fuckers can't fuck with you and me man\nI'm the best of the best, the head honcho\nThe el hombre intachable, man\nYou know what the business is, they can't fuck with me man\nYou know what my lifestyle is\nMan you know what I do, you can't fuck with me man\nWhat, a decade?

one\nDedication, hard work, prayers and belief\nAnd a good team {*ding ding*}\n\n[Verse 1: Ludacris]\nYeah, back up on that ass (yeah)\nBack to put rappers on one knee like they 'bout to run 100 meter dash\nBow down to greatness\nBefore I get pissed and run up in the stands like the Indiana Pacers\nCovered all my bases, straight, no chasers\nDiamonds on my chain look like my neck's full of glaciers\nTitanic flow (what?) Titanic dough (what?)\nWomen on my nuts like, \"Where the Titanic go?!\"\nI been scourin the Earth (yeah)\nMakin my fans catch the holy ghost at my shows like ya grandma at church\nAnd the fat lady's singin - it's over for you rappers\nCan't none of y'all bust, you're just sacs full of semen\nAnd I got the women screamin (AHHH!)\nThey could catch my balls on Any Given Sunday like my name's Willie Beamen\nOr LL Cool - so if your boyfriend\nThinks you loyal to his ass then he's a motherfuckin fool\nGot jewels on my pinky, jewels on my wrist (hey!)\nIconic status and his name is Ludacris\nBitch please! You messin with some real O.G.'s\nWith million dollar whips that I ship from overseas\nGot a pocket full of G's - and the inconvenient truth\nIs that the ozone is bad cause I been smokin' all the trees\nThe globe is warmin up when we fire up the blunt\nAnd put it in the air like Evel Knievel stunts\nWhat you want from me? (what?) I got pistols for the haters\nYour fam'll be in black like they was playin for the Raiders\nAnd your music isn't favored - and DJ's they NEVER bring it back\nLike when you go and borrow somethin from your neighbors\nLike a cup full of sugar, a rope full of salt\nThe name of my car insurance is \"YO' FUCKIN FAULT!\"\nAnd if you sittin' on chrome - I'll call up my boys\nAnd have you stripped of yo' metals like Marion Jones, nigga\n\n[Interlude: Floyd Mayweather Jr.] + (Ludacris)\nChamp you got it! Keep on movin\nThey ain't got nothin on you, watch for the sneak dissin\nThese boys'll smile in your face and stab you right in the back (I know)\nBring it, take some water\nThis is Money in the bank! (yeah)\nThey defeatin themselves, champ (yeah baby)\nYou know what you can do (I know)\nYou Luda! You lookin good, let's go! (aight)\nC'mon baby, hard work and dedication (yeah)\nYou know what it is man (aight let's go)\n{*ding ding ding*} Keep fightin!\n\n[Verse 2: Ludacris]\nYeah, back up on the scene (what?)\nBack to put a nail in these rappers' coffins\nI got the hammer in my jeans: call me Mr. Fix It\nBarrel stay hotter than\nA fresh batch of homemade buttermilk biscuits\nA-tisket, a-tasket, a custom-made casket\nLuda leaves intruders stretched out like gymnastics\nAnd acrobatics; I'm superstar status\nThe mouth of the South like Gangsta Grillz you bastards!\nThe international traveler\nAnd I may not be much to you, but I'm the SHIT out in Africa\nSo put ya fist up - even the Statue of Liberty\nLit a flame for the way that I lit my wrist up\nYou can't compete with me - I got 'em stuck\nLike I made a thousand rappers put shackles on they feet with me\nAnd then I broke free - I'll let 'em loose\nWhen Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston become drug-free\nI'm the baddest mother-shut-it like Shaft was\nLeavin' rappers with headaches like bad drugs\nThey shoulda warned ya - you got defeated\nBy the Heat, but ehh, we'll just say we Alonzo Mourn'd ya\nSo call the coroner (hey!)\nI'll show up to yo' funeral with some gators like I'm FRESH outta Florida\nCall me The Swamp Thang - y'all headed in the wrong direction\nLike you hit the subway and caught the wrong train\nSo don't fuck with it - I'm sendin' lyrical bullets\nRight at yo' dome, fuck niggas better duck with it (duck wit it!)\nOr else you stuck with it - you'll get stomped so bad\nYou'll leave the scene thinkin eight Young Buck's did it\nBut not in Ca$hville - you lost yo' feelin\nLike comin' down off X, chasin' effects of yo last pill (ha ha)\nYou fuckin' Daffodil, you's a Daffy Duck (what?)\nAnd I'm the undefeated champ, y'all niggas suck!\n\n[Interlude: Floyd Mayweather Jr.]\nHa ha ha ha!\nI told these muh'fuckers can't fuck with you and me man\nI'm the best of the best, the head honcho\nThe el hombre intachable, man\nYou know what the business is, they can't fuck with me man\nYou know what my lifestyle is\nMan you know what I do, you can't fuck with me man\nWhat, a decade? What?\nI'll go ten more, they can't fuck with me man\nLifestyle, you know what it is\nGettin money man, let's go\n\n[Outro: Ludacris]\nYeah baby, yeahhhh!\nI'm the champ! Undisputed, WHAT?\nWho wants some? Ha ha ha... whoo!\nI wish a muh'fucker would"}}, {"title": "Come and See Me", "album": "Ludaversal", "year": "2015-03-31", "lyrics": "[Spoken Intro]\n\n[Hook: Ludacris + Big K.R.I.T.]\n6 fifteens, candy coated riding clean\nEvery time I pull out a new whip I cause a scene\nRolling through my hood, I told 'em pimpin' ain't that easy\nSo whatever you need, little buddy, come and see me\n(Come and see me) Come and see me\n(Come and see me) Come and see me\nWhatever you need, little buddy, come and see me\n(Come and see me) Come and see me\n(Come and see me) Come and see me\nWhatever you need, little buddy, come and see me\n\n[Verse 1: Ludacris + Big KRIT]\nI'm talking Monte Carlos, Crown Vics, Cadillacs and Regals\nIf I get pulled over, everything I got's illegal\nBut I ain't got no worries I got Jesus riding shotgun\nKnowing that I need a meal ticket and I can't stop until I got one\nShit, I'm whippin' cutty bubble bucket busty, bitches love to ride too\nHanging out the window servin' niggas like a late-night Wendy's drive through\nTweeters, speakers, jeekers fiendin', diamond in the back my nigga\nI got two white girls, think I oughta have a curl in return of the mack, my nigga\nIt's the return of the 'Lac\nRiding on so many horses they think I'm playing polo\nCandy paint drippin' like a Jheri curl, nigga, I'mma let my soul glo\nFleet, flickin', screaming, bitches, pitchin', counter, past fate\nAnd all of the women get jealous cause of the way my car can make its ass shake\nLast to base, in the face\nThe law's right beside me, my window tint, dawg\nMy rims are too large\nAs soon as I hit the back road bet the law can't find me\nRidin', candy paint with two poles in the trunk\nPopped up twice with two hoes in the trunk\nDisturb your peace with fifteens that thump\nTouch my slab get sawed off with the pump\n\n[Hook: Ludacris + Big K.R.I.T.]\n6 fifteens, candy coated riding clean\nEvery time I pull out a  new whip I cause a scene\nRolling through my hood, I told 'em pimpin' ain't that easy\nSo whatever you need, little buddy, come and see me\n(Come and see me) Come and see me\n(Come and see me) Come and see me\nWhatever you need, little buddy, come and see me\n(Come and see me) Come and see me\n(Come and see me) Come and see me\nWhatever you need, little buddy, come and see me\n\n[Verse 2: Ludacris + Big K.R.I.T.]\nI got two floors in my trunk, club lights in my trunk\nI charge at the door them hoes hit the floor, we have club nights in my trunk\nCause it's an earthquake when I park, I keep a UFO in my yard\nMy wheels so big when I swing my whip I can high five God, Lord\nI could skydive off of the top of the roof, rims taller than King Kong\nRiding around looking for an ass that I could sit my drink on\nMy seats warm, my drink cold, my paint dry, but her mouth wet\nSuffocate that ho till that bitch look like Smurfette\n007 pressin' more buttons, I got all these gadgets, ho\nI got all these alpine, it could turn a square chick ratchet, ho\nNeon lights shine neon bright that I could direct all this traffic, ho\nYoung and wise my 9 to 5 would be a vortex if I crash it, ho\nLike a head on collision with a red bone mouth colder than Michigan\nReach in that glove box and I got more rubbers than Michelin\nI'm feeling like Yao Ming in the whip (why?)

can make its ass shake\nLast to base, in the face\nThe law's right beside me, my window tint, dawg\nMy rims are too large\nAs soon as I hit the back road bet the law can't find me\nRidin', candy paint with two poles in the trunk\nPopped up twice with two hoes in the trunk\nDisturb your peace with fifteens that thump\nTouch my slab get sawed off with the pump\n\n[Hook: Ludacris + Big K.R.I.T.]\n6 fifteens, candy coated riding clean\nEvery time I pull out a  new whip I cause a scene\nRolling through my hood, I told 'em pimpin' ain't that easy\nSo whatever you need, little buddy, come and see me\n(Come and see me) Come and see me\n(Come and see me) Come and see me\nWhatever you need, little buddy, come and see me\n(Come and see me) Come and see me\n(Come and see me) Come and see me\nWhatever you need, little buddy, come and see me\n\n[Verse 2: Ludacris + Big K.R.I.T.]\nI got two floors in my trunk, club lights in my trunk\nI charge at the door them hoes hit the floor, we have club nights in my trunk\nCause it's an earthquake when I park, I keep a UFO in my yard\nMy wheels so big when I swing my whip I can high five God, Lord\nI could skydive off of the top of the roof, rims taller than King Kong\nRiding around looking for an ass that I could sit my drink on\nMy seats warm, my drink cold, my paint dry, but her mouth wet\nSuffocate that ho till that bitch look like Smurfette\n007 pressin' more buttons, I got all these gadgets, ho\nI got all these alpine, it could turn a square chick ratchet, ho\nNeon lights shine neon bright that I could direct all this traffic, ho\nYoung and wise my 9 to 5 would be a vortex if I crash it, ho\nLike a head on collision with a red bone mouth colder than Michigan\nReach in that glove box and I got more rubbers than Michelin\nI'm feeling like Yao Ming in the whip (why?) I need more leg room\nSo I hit a switch and the whole back seat turned into a god damn bedroom\n\n[Hook: Ludacris + Big K.R.I.T.]\n6 fifteens, candy coated riding clean\nEvery time I pull out a  new whip I cause a scene\nRolling through my hood, I told 'em pimpin' ain't that easy\nSo whatever you need, little buddy, come and see me\n(Come and see me) Come and see me\n(Come and see me) Come and see me\nWhatever you need, little buddy, come and see me\n(Come and see me) Come and see me\n(Come and see me) Come and see me\nWhatever you need, little buddy, come and see me\n\n[Verse 3: Ludacris + Big KRIT]\nOkay now, ho, pour out that drink and watch me fire up that blunt\nAnybody getting outta line don't make me pop my fuckin' trunk\nDon't make you pop your fuckin' trunk?\nDon't make me pop my fuckin' trunk\nAnybody getting outta line don't make me pop my fuckin' trunk\nO-o-o-okay, now bow down when you see me, don't be trippin' on the thump\nAnybody getting outta line don't make me pop my fuckin' trunk\nDon't make you pop your fuckin' trunk?\nDon't make me pop my fuckin' trunk\nAnybody getting outta line don't make me pop my fuckin' trunk\nHold up"}}, {"title": "One More Drink", "album": "Theater of the Mind", "year": "2008-10-28", "lyrics": "[Ludacris]\nIt was Friday night and I was feelin aight (yup)\nDowntown Atlanta, big city, bright lights\nMixin Henny with the Sprite while I'm drinkin and drivin\nNo police lights (lights) no police sirens\nI'm headed to the club, lookin for a freak (freak)\nTo spread a little love and spread a couple cheeks (cheeks)\nPull up to the spot 26's like BAM!\nEyes on me like, \"Bitch do you SEE 'EM?\"\nStrolled through the front do' headed to the VIP (VIP)\nBought a couple bottles and I took a couple sips (sips)\nScopin out the room, and what do I SEE?\nA nice round butt, and a pair of double D's!\nSo I crept up like, \"Shorty what's happenin\nYou killin that dress and I love it with a passion\"\nThen she turned around and her face was aight\nShe had a gap tooth and a mean overbite, but I was like hmmmm\n\n[Hook: T-Pain]\nYeah yeah; if I take one more drink, I'm gon' end up fuckin you\nIs that what you wanna do, shorty?\nIf I take one more drink, I'm gon' end up fuckin you\nYou too, ooh ooh ooooh\n\n[Ludacris]\nWoke up the next mornin and all I can remember\nWas takin shots and tippin the bartender\nSurrendered to the woman end up bringin me home\nCause she started lookin better every shot of Patron, yup!\nI jumped up with a devilish grin\nCause tonight, damn right I might do it again\nSo I called up the homies (whattup) let's ride\nWe can hit the sports bar over on the Southside (aight)\nGet a couple of Coronas, couple of limes (yup)\nWent up to the bar and saw a couple of dimes\nSo I, slowly walked up and said hi\nMy name's Ludacris and I'm a hell of a guy\nOne said \"I know who you are, I'm your number one fan\nAnd right now it's too bad I got a man\"\nAnd I said I understand (I understand)\nBut where the hell is he at cause in a minute if he don't show up then mannnnn\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Ludacris] Uh-huh huh, ay Pain holla at 'em right quick man\n\n[T-Pain] + (Ludacris)\nYeah, you gon' get in trouble with yo' man girl\n(Don't get in trouble girl)\nTalkin 'bout how you're my biggest fan girl (I know it, I know it!)\nNow I don't wanna do (please) what you're gon' make me do\n(Don't make me do it, don't make me do it!)\nBut I, if I have more drink\n\n[Ludacris]\nOne mo' drink I'mma get ya home then I'll split ya\nGrab the camera phone and take a bunch of drunk pictures\nCause Hennessy mixed with a whole bunch of buddah\nEquals you mixed with a whole bunch of Luda\nAnd you know how far one drink could go\nStart slurrin my speech slowin up the flow\nHikin up ya skirt, climbin up ya shirt\nIt's Mr. Late Night Luda and I like to flirt\nSo guess what baby girl!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Ludacris - over Hook]\nJust one mo', that's all it's gon' take\nWho else, T-Pain?\n\n[Outro: Ludacris]\nHa ha ha, you hear what I'm sayin?\nPeople too picky these days, damnit\nToo tall, too short, too fat, too skinny\nHave a couple of drinks and quit discriminatin\nThis has been a Luda Service Announcement\nDeuces, ha ha ha ha", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/ba06126bece3c2e89a96c7f646d4860f.700x700x1.jpg", "artist": "Ludacris", "raw": {"annotation_count": 11, "api_path": "/songs/2977", "apple_music_id": "296870225", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/2977/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "\u201cOne More Drink\u201d is the second official single off Ludacris' album, Theater of the Mind.

"[Ludacris]\nIt was Friday night and I was feelin aight (yup)\nDowntown Atlanta, big city, bright lights\nMixin Henny with the Sprite while I'm drinkin and drivin\nNo police lights (lights) no police sirens\nI'm headed to the club, lookin for a freak (freak)\nTo spread a little love and spread a couple cheeks (cheeks)\nPull up to the spot 26's like BAM!\nEyes on me like, \"Bitch do you SEE 'EM?\"\nStrolled through the front do' headed to the VIP (VIP)\nBought a couple bottles and I took a couple sips (sips)\nScopin out the room, and what do I SEE?\nA nice round butt, and a pair of double D's!\nSo I crept up like, \"Shorty what's happenin\nYou killin that dress and I love it with a passion\"\nThen she turned around and her face was aight\nShe had a gap tooth and a mean overbite, but I was like hmmmm\n\n[Hook: T-Pain]\nYeah yeah; if I take one more drink, I'm gon' end up fuckin you\nIs that what you wanna do, shorty?\nIf I take one more drink, I'm gon' end up fuckin you\nYou too, ooh ooh ooooh\n\n[Ludacris]\nWoke up the next mornin and all I can remember\nWas takin shots and tippin the bartender\nSurrendered to the woman end up bringin me home\nCause she started lookin better every shot of Patron, yup!\nI jumped up with a devilish grin\nCause tonight, damn right I might do it again\nSo I called up the homies (whattup) let's ride\nWe can hit the sports bar over on the Southside (aight)\nGet a couple of Coronas, couple of limes (yup)\nWent up to the bar and saw a couple of dimes\nSo I, slowly walked up and said hi\nMy name's Ludacris and I'm a hell of a guy\nOne said \"I know who you are, I'm your number one fan\nAnd right now it's too bad I got a man\"\nAnd I said I understand (I understand)\nBut where the hell is he at cause in a minute if he don't show up then mannnnn\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Ludacris] Uh-huh huh, ay Pain holla at 'em right quick man\n\n[T-Pain] + (Ludacris)\nYeah, you gon' get in trouble with yo' man girl\n(Don't get in trouble girl)\nTalkin 'bout how you're my biggest fan girl (I know it, I know it!)\nNow I don't wanna do (please) what you're gon' make me do\n(Don't make me do it, don't make me do it!)\nBut I, if I have more drink\n\n[Ludacris]\nOne mo' drink I'mma get ya home then I'll split ya\nGrab the camera phone and take a bunch of drunk pictures\nCause Hennessy mixed with a whole bunch of buddah\nEquals you mixed with a whole bunch of Luda\nAnd you know how far one drink could go\nStart slurrin my speech slowin up the flow\nHikin up ya skirt, climbin up ya shirt\nIt's Mr. Late Night Luda and I like to flirt\nSo guess what baby girl!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Ludacris - over Hook]\nJust one mo', that's all it's gon' take\nWho else, T-Pain?\n\n[Outro: Ludacris]\nHa ha ha, you hear what I'm sayin?\nPeople too picky these days, damnit\nToo tall, too short, too fat, too skinny\nHave a couple of drinks and quit discriminatin\nThis has been a Luda Service Announcement\nDeuces, ha ha ha ha"}}, {"title": "Freaky

bed\n\n[Hook: Ludacris]\nSee she makes her own money, pays her own bills\nAlways stays fly, keeps it so real\nBut behind closed do's she a nasty girl (yup)\nBehind closed do's she a nasty girl\nShe got a crazy little figure, nice round ass\nWalks so proper, talks with such class\nBut behind closed do's she a nasty girl (yup)\nBehind closed do's she a nasty girl\n\n[Ludacris]\nYeah, I met this girl named Keisha, she was so sweet (yup)\nNails stay manicured, pretty little feet (woo!)\nShoes so sexy, body so hot\nHair lookin like she just came from the shop\nLegs so smooth, clothes so tight\nStyle so sexy, makeup just right\nNever too much, never too little\nBlack lace bra, Vickie Secrets in the middle\nEyes so innocent, smile so bright\nWorks in the mornin but she'll party all night\nAll for her man, all cause she bout it\nAll cause she crazy in love and don't doubt it\nProduct of her birthplace, know about the streets\nClean in the workplace, dirty in the sheets\nKeeps her own toaster, makes her own bread\nLady in the STREET but a freak in the bed, cause\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Plies]\nOkay, okay, haha\nI got a college girl who go to church e'ry Sunday\nHad her sneak out of choir rehearsal to put it on me\nBut she's so innocent, when she ridin, mami\nOne thing about her, she get her own money\nGave it to her yesterday while she was doin laundry\nFavorite chore of mine, it's my lil' bunny\nBow-legged and classy, such a real woman\nSex all night, go to work e'ry mornin\nText me from work and told me she was horny\nText her back and told her, \"Me too mami\"\nWhen you get off work, daddy gon' punish\nYou my nasty girl forever I promise\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Ludacris]\nI got a doctor girlfriend that tells me, \"Come home soon!\"\nShe plays like my house is her emergency room\nTells me to undress and to lay on the sofa\nChecks all my vitals like a doc's supposed ta\nAll white coat, all white heels\nAnd nothin underneath so it's an all night deal\nI'm her number one patient and delighted to be\nAnd when she needs her medicine I give her vitamin D\nBut wait! I got a lawyer girl that's so wild\nAnd every single night she wanna take me to trial\nSaid she needs some evidence, and to show her the PROOF\nSo I put her on the stand and I give her the truth!\nCause I'm hung like a jury (jury)\nJudge Luda preside over your body and I'm never in a hurry\nYou may proceed, let the games begin\nAnd if I call a mistrial we gotta do it again\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "Blow It Out", "album": "Chicken-n-Beer", "year": "2003-09-28", "lyrics": "[Ludacris]\nAOWWWW!\nI never used to snore in my sleep 'til this rap shit started\nWarm thoughts fill the hot-headed and cold-hearted\nYour whole paycheck, you burp it and then fart it\nAnd y'all think I'm gon' stop?

thoughts fill the hot-headed and cold-hearted\nYour whole paycheck, you burp it and then fart it\nAnd y'all think I'm gon' stop? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!\nIn one year I got rich, now life's movin so fast\nBut bein broke with no food is just a thing of the past\nPlus I'm the new phenomenon like white women with ass\nAnd y'all prayin that I flop? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!\nIn New York I buy clothing, in Cali I get green\nIn Atlanta I get sleep, in Texas I sip lean\nAll these rappers wanna know what I'm gettin for sixteens\nTry 80, want a discount? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!\nSee in just six months I infiltrated the system\nIf you find somebody better, then I'm sorry I missed him\nNiggas hate givin me props cause I might use it against them\nC'mon, get Ludacris out! BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!\n\n[Hook 2X: Ludacris]\nIf you mad I'm on top, then wish me gone\nIf you mad I'm on the road, then wish me home\nAnd if you mad that I'm right, punk wish me wrong\nBut after your three wishes - BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!\n\n[Ludacris]\nIt's time to saddle up the Tontos cause I'm the Lone Ranger\nI eat dinner with Jews but don't talk to strangers\nI'm just a few albums from filling your disc changer\nIf you ever think of stoppin me - BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!\nI'm a hustler by nature but criminal by law\nAny charges set against me, chunk it up and stand tall\nNext year I'm lookin into buyin Greenbriar Mall\nYou probably own a lot of property! BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!\nC'mon and take a look, he's got gigantic balls\nPlus his money keeps flowin like Niagara Falls\nWe all know Jesus saves and Ludacris withdraws\nI'm 'bout to go on vacation - BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!\nShout out to Bill O'Reilly, I'mma throw you a curve\nYou mad cause I'm a THIEF and got away with words\nI'mma start my own beverage, it'll calm your nerves\nPepsi's the New Generation - BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Ludacris]\nMy black people show me love when I'm up on the block\nAnd Latinos always waitin for my CD's to drop\nWhite people love the flow, they say, \"Dude, you fuckin rock!\"\nYo' fans are my fans, right? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!\nSo find my album in the stores and look for the white steam\nRip it open, play it and yo' momma might scream\nIt's hard, other albums are softer than ice cream\nYo' scans are my scans, right? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!\nNow Luda's throwin up A's, and I'm lightin up L's\nAround the globe gettin paid, you home bitin yo' nails\nDTP, the only label that practice fightin ourselves\nWe probably gettin on your nerves, huh? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!\nI been eatin and gettin FAT while y'all dyin of hunger\nI get drunk in the winter, stay high in the summer\nWatch out, my album's puttin up McDonald's numbers\nYou over 6 million served, huh? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!\n\n[Hook]\n\nBLOW IT OUT YA ASS!\nWHOO!"}}, {"title": "We Got", "album": "Chicken-n-Beer", "year": "2003-10-07", "lyrics": "[Intro: Ludacris]\nDTP we got them guns that go (gun sound)\n\n[Verse 1: I-20]\nYea I'm all about that pistol player, cold blooded killer\nNiggas recognize my name, I dub the young dealer\nYou better tell ya man that with the gages I'm nice\nIll shoot up y'all white shirts until you all look like dice\nBut I'm through with all the talking time to show all you niggas\nI 2-0, I'm like J-Lo...going through niggas\nDTP we ain't playing if you try to get our pen\nA.K's get to spraying like\nBottom line that mean I'm bout it, any nigga want it, doubt it\nBust you in the broad day, on a street that's fully crowded\nCome on a hole inside your chest, just for thinking it's rap\nAnd tell that pretty bitch thug we got some pretty big gats\nChaka say I'm shot out, and I tend to agree\nSo you should watch what you saying if it's intended for me\nSo be careful what you starting, let my fingers do the walking\nAnd that Uzi get to talking like *Gun Sound*\n\n[Verse 2: Tity Boi]\nHammers, jam 'em, snatch 'em, grab 'em\nCan the an and fuck 'em, damn 'em\nPress him, man him, scared him, teared him, kneed him up\nBake him, take him, beat him up, I hate I hate, I eat him up\nA-B-C-D-E-F shawty is you a G or what\nNow it's just me and my nuts, that's all I got in this world\nI'm pulling pistols out my stomach and throwing them bitches up like earl\nServing the club, head shot, scattered, covered, run, scram 'em\nI'm 38, hot with a pearl handle\nAnd I'm throwing techs like a NBA ref\nI got, all gold guns like they came from I-RAQ\nArtillery, could it be I got all kinds of these pistols\nI point my gun at ya homeboy make ya own folks hit ya\nAnd they ain't taking no more pictures, if you snap I'mma click\nAnyway, plus I got bullets in the clip the size of Lil Fate\nAnd I'm waving choppers like heli-copters\nYou gonna need hella doctors, when the glok go *Gun Sound*\n\n[Verse 3: Chingy]\nSay on the set bitch, better watch your lip those Tecs be quick\n20 over thurr, Tity over thurr, Luda over thurr, ain't no exit trick\nUs you don't mess with, we got them guns like action flicks\nReload with the next clip, I'm the wrong nigga to flex with bitch\nCome on and test this, my gun I'm having sex with shit\nPut a bullet in (in) shoot it out, got them long horns like Texas bitch\nLook at my necklace, maybe hit a nigga disrespect this click\nMy pistol grip sound like this...now what\nWho want that they fucked, when I cock and load the cake, bust bust\nYou all cowards play tough, and my peeps we come to spray stuff up\nYou all lives made up, like ugly hoes with make-up bra\nWe'll suit you up then toss yo ass in the lake tough nut\nMy wrist rocky, like Sylvester Stallone\nSo thurr for you should invest, in a vest for your dome\nCause I know you marks planning on getting me when I'm landing\nPeace to Nick, but my cannon go *Gun Sound*\n\n[Verse 4: Ludacris]\nFuck a medic, we gonna call yo ass a taxi cab\nBleeding so hard you'll need a life size maxi pad\nSo flip the script and tell your woman its your time of the month\nA.K. 47 for the niggas who's really looking for heaven and a 9 for you chumps\nGot killers in my squad and I'm the nicest one in my group\nBut I got bananas for you niggas and I ain't talking bout fruit\nI\u2019ll peel your cap back with the black mac\n'Til your back crack, cock the gat back like (clak clak clak)\nSwallow a hallow make 'em digest with a 50 caliber\nYo futures not looking so good, tomorrows not on your calendar\nI, do away with the amateurs, they breathing too long\nIll leave 'em coughing like the sound effects you hear in this song\nMy shotguns are cold and hard, but my desert is easy\nAnd my triggers are always talking about some squeeze me, squeeze me\nAnd for these fakers talking greasy, I'm starting the show\nMy uzi got a drum roll, it goes *Gun Sound*", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1498cf277a7dc50ffc916ca191c3608f.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Ludacris", "raw": {"annotation_count": 10, "api_path": "/songs/1649", "apple_music_id":

"lyrics": "[Intro: Ludacris]\nDTP we got them guns that go (gun sound)\n\n[Verse 1: I-20]\nYea I'm all about that pistol player, cold blooded killer\nNiggas recognize my name, I dub the young dealer\nYou better tell ya man that with the gages I'm nice\nIll shoot up y'all white shirts until you all look like dice\nBut I'm through with all the talking time to show all you niggas\nI 2-0, I'm like J-Lo...going through niggas\nDTP we ain't playing if you try to get our pen\nA.K's get to spraying like\nBottom line that mean I'm bout it, any nigga want it, doubt it\nBust you in the broad day, on a street that's fully crowded\nCome on a hole inside your chest, just for thinking it's rap\nAnd tell that pretty bitch thug we got some pretty big gats\nChaka say I'm shot out, and I tend to agree\nSo you should watch what you saying if it's intended for me\nSo be careful what you starting, let my fingers do the walking\nAnd that Uzi get to talking like *Gun Sound*\n\n[Verse 2: Tity Boi]\nHammers, jam 'em, snatch 'em, grab 'em\nCan the an and fuck 'em, damn 'em\nPress him, man him, scared him, teared him, kneed him up\nBake him, take him, beat him up, I hate I hate, I eat him up\nA-B-C-D-E-F shawty is you a G or what\nNow it's just me and my nuts, that's all I got in this world\nI'm pulling pistols out my stomach and throwing them bitches up like earl\nServing the club, head shot, scattered, covered, run, scram 'em\nI'm 38, hot with a pearl handle\nAnd I'm throwing techs like a NBA ref\nI got, all gold guns like they came from I-RAQ\nArtillery, could it be I got all kinds of these pistols\nI point my gun at ya homeboy make ya own folks hit ya\nAnd they ain't taking no more pictures, if you snap I'mma click\nAnyway, plus I got bullets in the clip the size of Lil Fate\nAnd I'm waving choppers like heli-copters\nYou gonna need hella doctors, when the glok go *Gun Sound*\n\n[Verse 3: Chingy]\nSay on the set bitch, better watch your lip those Tecs be quick\n20 over thurr, Tity over thurr, Luda over thurr, ain't no exit trick\nUs you don't mess with, we got them guns like action flicks\nReload with the next clip, I'm the wrong nigga to flex with bitch\nCome on and test this, my gun I'm having sex with shit\nPut a bullet in (in) shoot it out, got them long horns like Texas bitch\nLook at my necklace, maybe hit a nigga disrespect this click\nMy pistol grip sound like this...now what\nWho want that they fucked, when I cock and load the cake, bust bust\nYou all cowards play tough, and my peeps we come to spray stuff up\nYou all lives made up, like ugly hoes with make-up bra\nWe'll suit you up then toss yo ass in the lake tough nut\nMy wrist rocky, like Sylvester Stallone\nSo thurr for you should invest, in a vest for your dome\nCause I know you marks planning on getting me when I'm landing\nPeace to Nick, but my cannon go *Gun Sound*\n\n[Verse 4: Ludacris]\nFuck a medic, we gonna call yo ass a taxi cab\nBleeding so hard you'll need a life size maxi pad\nSo flip the script and tell your woman its your time of the month\nA.K. 47 for the niggas who's really looking for heaven and a 9 for you chumps\nGot killers in my squad and I'm the nicest one in my group\nBut I got bananas for you niggas and I ain't talking bout fruit\nI\u2019ll peel your cap back with the black mac\n'Til your back crack, cock the gat back like (clak clak clak)\nSwallow a hallow make 'em digest with a 50 caliber\nYo futures not looking so good, tomorrows not on your calendar\nI, do away with the amateurs, they breathing too long\nIll leave 'em coughing like the sound effects you hear in this song\nMy shotguns are cold and hard, but my desert is easy\nAnd my triggers are always talking about some squeeze me, squeeze me\nAnd for these fakers talking greasy, I'm starting the show\nMy uzi got a drum roll, it goes *Gun Sound*"}}, {"title": "Saturday (Oooh!

where they flip them birds\nTrick car alarms, then bend them curves\nChop chop, chunk it up fat man herb\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Ludacris]\nIt's illegal bout the plants in my backyard grow, that's my bud\nSmoke 'til ya drop out, that's my luck\nKeep a couple rolled and I hit the club in the back door, NIGGA WHAT?!\nAct like I don't make clout, how you gonna act like I don't get loud?\nHow you gonna act like I don't rock crowds?\nAnd leave a lot of people with a gap tooth smile\nIf I recollect right then you sound like dirt\nBut, I guess what you really don't know don't hurt\nWith a vest, and a pump hear the shot gun squirt\nMy folks on the block, man, they got that work (they got that work)\nDon't it smell so good, in Southwest where they rep that hood\nProtect your chest, they up to no good\nAnd come through flossin, they wish y'all would\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Ludacris]\nWorldwide hustlers get that dough\nWork that tip, get rid of evidence, move that brick\nKeep a D eagle with an extra clip\nThink it ain't so, SUCK A DICK!\nAct like I just do rap\nHow you gonna act like I just ain't strapped?\nHow you gonna act like I don't push lacs?\nBlack Eldorado, fifth wheel on BACK!\nIchy finger trigger, man, Luda don't squeeze\nWith a mac, with a Glock I'mma make 'em say please\nIn the back, on block so the cops they freeze\nAnd I'm so high, I think I got a nose bleed, you gotta nose bleed?\nDon't it smell so sweet?\nIn Decatur, where we pack that heat\nAnd rob the neighbors in the night creep, creep\nI'll see you LATER we'll be in them streets...\n\n[Hook: repeat

Some violent shit!\nTwo step and lay back, still wilin' shit\nWhattup? Hey baby, I got the potion\nTake a sip of this and put your back in motion\n\n[Verse 2]\nOnly standin' five eight but still a big shot, plus I got a big\nClean everyday, stay fresher than what's in a Ziploc\nTell your man to kick rocks, when I make my pitstops\nI'm in, then it's hard to get me out like I'm a slip knot\nBorn to be a leader and not, no not a follower\nOnly hang with chicks that got mo' twists than Oliver\nNot much of a hollerer, but I'd like to borrow her lips\nBringin out the best in me 'specially if she a swallower\nFreaky deaky yellow man, and I'm sayin hello man\nTo all the lovely ladies that like to jiggle like Jello man\nBigger booty, small waist, put 'em in a small place\nAnd if it ain't no ass where I'm at, then I'm in the wrong place\nBail like a bondsman, but keep 'em dancin'\nGot pop potential, stay black like Bob Johnson\nWho the hell is that in that fancy car?\nTell yo' momma I'm a ghet-to su-per-star\n\n[Chorus]\nLil' buddy what you want? Some violent shit!\nTwo-step and lay back, still wilin' shit\nWhattup? Hey baby, I got the potion\nTake a sip of this and put your back in motion\nLil' buddy what you want? Some violent shit!\nTwo step and lay back, still wilin' shit\nWhattup? Hey baby, I got the potion\nTake a sip of this and put your back in motion\n\n[Breakdown]\nAnd jump down turn around, pick a bale of cotton\nJump down turn around, pick a bale of hay\nOh lordy, pick a bale of cotton\nOh lordy, pick a bale of hay\nJump down turn around, pick a bale of cotton\nJump down turn around, pick a bale of hay\nOh lordy, pick a bale of cotton\nOh lordy, pick a bale of hay\n\n[Verse 3]\nStill working like a slave, learning tricks of the trade\nIn a ghetto state of mind, say I'm rich and I'm paid\nPickin' records like cotton in the thick of the day\nTill I'm spoiled and I'm rotten in a sinister way\nLife no different than those on minimum wage\nMore money but still locked in a similar cage\nEither losers of tomorrow or we winners today\nDigest that and there's really nothin' missin' to say but\n\n[Chorus]\nLil' buddy what you want? Some violent shit!\nTwo-step and lay back, still wilin' shit\nWhattup? Hey baby, I got the potion\nTake a sip of this and put your back in motion\nLil' buddy what you want? Some violent shit!\nTwo step and lay back, still wilin' shit\nWhattup?

Ludacris]\nDeath by lyrical injection, I kill you rappers\nA lotta green with a yellow complexion\nWomen call me the Green Bay Packer\nI pack the zero's, meaning mucho dinero\nSo paid, rappers is waitin\u2019 on trades\nAnd they all gettin' Knicked like Melo\nHello, Luda\nTell theses other boys double up\nCause I got some work all on my waste but I call it a tummy tuck\nMy every records jumpin', or playin' double dutch\nI shit on rappers every verse just got the bubble guts\n\n[Verse 2: Joe Budden]\nLet me tell this to the people not understandin' my moxy\nAnimal, watch me if you think it's tangible, stop me\nBut then I hit 'em with a flow that they can't even copy\nSee we don't play that where I'm from it's like fantasy hockey\nSup with the dog, thugs want a war\nBad GM, what you want to trade slugs with him for\nWhile you cuffin 'em all, I'm stuffin' her jaw\nThen leave 'em for you to rebound\nKevin Love on the boards\nDog, you and your skill retard hard from of our squad\nI'll put you on a crash course in a Smartcar\nWhile I'm speedin' not relyin' on the brake pad\nIn a car that you should only drive on a race track\nSo the lines about your phantoms and your Maybach\nAre ghost tales of the phantom, face facts\nYou ruined hip-hop\nSlaughterhouse will payback\nGet in shape and a tatt\nWe done faded to black\n\n[Refrain]\n\n[Verse 3: Royce da 5'9\"]\nI went from eatin' Top Ramen to bein'\nTop Rhymer, check full of commas\nNo regrets except for the drama\nI remember a time when my only perfection was my momma\nMy mind a long erection\nNow it's time you bow down and erect a monu-ment in my honor\nCause bitch I'm bonker, plural\nIn the whip with my Ivanka, pompous girls\nShe on E, feelin' on me, singin' on-key\nWhile I'm bumpin', We Are the World\nGot her sniffin' Britney, no he didn't did he\nWe run this town\nNo he isn't Diddy\nI feel like tiltlin' the glass\nShe take a sip with me\nShe from the city of Jackson\nCall her Mississippi\nThat was pretty witty\nYour man like a Black man tryna get re-elected\nHe ain't gettin' diddley\n\n[Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]\nStickin' it to the pedal, pedal to the floor\nJust whippin' it through the ghetto\nMetal in the door\nIn case I gotta throw some lead into ya, boy\nReferee mind state, I\u2019m settlin' the score\nI don\u2019t know what ya\u2019ll hatin' for\nWait, wait, know what, matter fact\nI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re waitin' for\nI ain't finna say nothin'\nTurn the bass up more til the speakers pop\nI get a kick outta that, like a sneaker spot\nSee I was a little kid with his thumbs in his ears\nAnd his tongue in the air going na-na-na-nah-naaar\nJust when you think it stop na-na-na-nah-naaar\nEverything I speak is hot\nDon't be mad at least everything you speak is\nI can\u2019t think of nothing nice to say, you\u2019re not nice okay\n\n[Verse 5: Crooked I]\nRapper, hustler, entrepreneur\nMy shit fly like I'm launchin' manure\nLord of the underground, God of the sewer\nOn Hennessy Black, on Con-to-the-jure\nYeah, I'm off the block\nThis ain't work, homie I'm off the clock\nI'm a syllable Hannibal killer\nA cannibal with a mechanical mandible to deliver the flammable\nAmmo, lyrical animal off the top\nRep that West til I walk with Pac\nWe the 2.0 Boys, Tiz, Crook and Joe, Royce\nNew Ghost Rolls Royce pulled off the lot\nPop me the only way you could stop me\nI'm top seed, I clock green at mach speed\nSo watch me if you haven't seen a phenomenon\nSpit fast as Lamborghini's and Ramadan\n\n[Refrain]\n\n[Outro: Claret Jai]\nI suggest you shut down\nPack your 'ish and turn around\nBecause tonight we run this town\nSo let your feet swiftly hit the ground\nWe too dangerous for the world", "image":

me the Green Bay Packer\nI pack the zero's, meaning mucho dinero\nSo paid, rappers is waitin\u2019 on trades\nAnd they all gettin' Knicked like Melo\nHello, Luda\nTell theses other boys double up\nCause I got some work all on my waste but I call it a tummy tuck\nMy every records jumpin', or playin' double dutch\nI shit on rappers every verse just got the bubble guts\n\n[Verse 2: Joe Budden]\nLet me tell this to the people not understandin' my moxy\nAnimal, watch me if you think it's tangible, stop me\nBut then I hit 'em with a flow that they can't even copy\nSee we don't play that where I'm from it's like fantasy hockey\nSup with the dog, thugs want a war\nBad GM, what you want to trade slugs with him for\nWhile you cuffin 'em all, I'm stuffin' her jaw\nThen leave 'em for you to rebound\nKevin Love on the boards\nDog, you and your skill retard hard from of our squad\nI'll put you on a crash course in a Smartcar\nWhile I'm speedin' not relyin' on the brake pad\nIn a car that you should only drive on a race track\nSo the lines about your phantoms and your Maybach\nAre ghost tales of the phantom, face facts\nYou ruined hip-hop\nSlaughterhouse will payback\nGet in shape and a tatt\nWe done faded to black\n\n[Refrain]\n\n[Verse 3: Royce da 5'9\"]\nI went from eatin' Top Ramen to bein'\nTop Rhymer, check full of commas\nNo regrets except for the drama\nI remember a time when my only perfection was my momma\nMy mind a long erection\nNow it's time you bow down and erect a monu-ment in my honor\nCause bitch I'm bonker, plural\nIn the whip with my Ivanka, pompous girls\nShe on E, feelin' on me, singin' on-key\nWhile I'm bumpin', We Are the World\nGot her sniffin' Britney, no he didn't did he\nWe run this town\nNo he isn't Diddy\nI feel like tiltlin' the glass\nShe take a sip with me\nShe from the city of Jackson\nCall her Mississippi\nThat was pretty witty\nYour man like a Black man tryna get re-elected\nHe ain't gettin' diddley\n\n[Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]\nStickin' it to the pedal, pedal to the floor\nJust whippin' it through the ghetto\nMetal in the door\nIn case I gotta throw some lead into ya, boy\nReferee mind state, I\u2019m settlin' the score\nI don\u2019t know what ya\u2019ll hatin' for\nWait, wait, know what, matter fact\nI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re waitin' for\nI ain't finna say nothin'\nTurn the bass up more til the speakers pop\nI get a kick outta that, like a sneaker spot\nSee I was a little kid with his thumbs in his ears\nAnd his tongue in the air going na-na-na-nah-naaar\nJust when you think it stop na-na-na-nah-naaar\nEverything I speak is hot\nDon't be mad at least everything you speak is\nI can\u2019t think of nothing nice to say, you\u2019re not nice okay\n\n[Verse 5: Crooked I]\nRapper, hustler, entrepreneur\nMy shit fly like I'm launchin' manure\nLord of the underground, God of the sewer\nOn Hennessy Black, on Con-to-the-jure\nYeah, I'm off the block\nThis ain't work, homie I'm off the clock\nI'm a syllable Hannibal killer\nA cannibal with a mechanical mandible to deliver the flammable\nAmmo, lyrical animal off the top\nRep that West til I walk with Pac\nWe the 2.0 Boys, Tiz, Crook and Joe, Royce\nNew Ghost Rolls Royce pulled off the lot\nPop me the only way you could stop me\nI'm top seed, I clock green at mach speed\nSo watch me if you haven't seen a phenomenon\nSpit fast as Lamborghini's and Ramadan\n\n[Refrain]\n\n[Outro: Claret Jai]\nI suggest you shut down\nPack your 'ish and turn around\nBecause tonight we run this town\nSo let your feet swiftly hit the ground\nWe too dangerous for the world"}}, {"title": "Helluva Night", "album": "#IDGAF", "year": "2013-08-27", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nI feel fantastic!\nI wanna fuck something!\n(It's about to be a hell

(x4)\nIt's about to be a hell of a night\n\n[Verse 2]\nClub packed, and women gettin' they drink on\nJust looking for a reason to get they freak on\nCatch me up in the VIP and it's roped off (Why?)\nTO keep raggedy ass hoes off\nAnd I'm 'bout to have a smoke-off\nRich nigga, but I'm trying to get broke off\nTurn it up as I make the beat break down\nAss up... FACE DOWN!\nYeah, that's still the best way to get it\nDown the middle, that's the best way to split it\nI'm talkin' money, Disturbing Tha Peace racked up\nOne too many American black cards stacked uuuu-u-u-up\nBacked up and it's on\nDon't get beat down to the song\nI see these hatin' ass niggas wanna fight\nWell it's about to be a hell of a night\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm always looking for trouble to get into\nTell your girlfriend's friends, bring friends too\nWhat you drinkin'? I got it, I pour it all up\nSouthside, my partners they throw it all up\nI don't want a menage, so bitch, let go\nI'm tryin'a get three women, play Connect 4\nCongratulations, you made it into the Top 5\nYour mouth helped me push the Bentley into Mach 5\nShe got me speedin' in the red zone\nOr as Luda like to call it, it's the Head Zone\nHeads up! A bread winner, the bread's up\nSo make a peace sign baby, put your legs up\nIs it really that good to ya?\nDo you like it when a nigga talk hood to ya?\nDo you like a lil' scratch, lil' bite?\nWell, it's about to be a hell of a night\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "Georgia", "album": "Disturbing tha Peace", "year": "2005-10-09", "lyrics": "\"Georgia\" \"Georgia!\"\n\"Georgia\" \"Georgia!\"\n\n[Hook 2X: Ludacris]\nWe on the grind in (\"Georgia!\")\nAll the time....\nIt ain't nothin' on my mind but (\"Georgia\")\nWe ain't playin' witcha\n\n[Ludacris]\nCountry names, country slang, fiends at the liquor sto'\nBlack cruisin', craps shootin', 50 on the 10 to 4\nOvercast, the forecast, shows clouds from plenty dro\nAnd we read for war in the state of (\"Georgia\")\nYEAH!

(fuck, meee!)\nTogether holdin hands, you out there spendin grands\nAnd makin family plans - say it (make love to me)\nDon't have to straighten facts, don't want no strings attached\nJust scratches on your BACK - what? (fuck, meee!)\nEx's ain't actin right, and you so glad to fight\nDinner's by candlelight - say it (make love to me)\nShe got a nigga whipped, down to ya fingertips\nTryin that freaky shit - what? (fuck, meee!)\nTurn on some Babyface, just for your lady's sake\nYou call her babycakes - say it (make love to me)\nKnow how to mack a broad, she's on your sack and balls\nYou call her Jabberjaws - what? (fuck, meee!)\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse Two]\nYou bout to buy a ring, she needs the finer things\nGucci designer frames - say it (make love to me)\nPurchase a nasty flick, wrap up and tie her quick\nKnow how to drive a stick - what? (fuck, meee!)\nYou both unite as one, you the moon and she's your sun\nYour heart's a beating drum - say it (make love to me)\nYou better not of came, she want to feel the pain\nThen hear her scream your name - what? (fuck, meee!)\nFollow this DICK-tionary, you're both some visionaries\nThen do it missionary - say it (make love to me)\nI hear 'em call da wild, and do it all the while\nDoggy and FROGGY style - what? (fuck, meee!)\nYou in between the sheets, lickin and eatin sweets\nAnd what you find you keep - say it (make love to me)\nYou do it standin up, orgasms hand 'em up\nY'all just don't GIVE A FUCK - what? (fuck, meee!)\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse Three]\nYou wanna tell the world, cause she's your favorite girl\nYour diamond and your pearl - say it (make love to me)\nNobody has to know, just keep it on the low\nAnd meet 'em right at fo' - what?

mouth (out yo' mouth) {*3X*}\nCause I was raised in the motherfuckin' south (in the south)\nKeep my name out your mu'fuckin' mouth (out yo' mouth) {*3X*}\nCause I was raised in the motherfuckin'...\n\n[Ludacris]\n(Luda!) Southside, College Park, yeah I rep that\nWhere there's money, all my dawgs, go and fetch that\nNiggas robbin' in the hood, we don't sweat that\nThrow some some red dots up on your head and connect that (HAHH!)\nI guess you in the right place, at the right time\nAnd I been drinkin' I'm not really in my right mind\nThe wrong move'll make a nigga grab the right nine\nKnock your livin' daylights out, bitch, night time\nCome off up them stacks, if you don't give 'em then we gon' take 'em\nGo and get 'em or we gon' chase him, go stick him and might erase him\nOr turn him into a patient, any demon's we gon' face 'em\nOr see all the pigs and all that bacon, we gon' as-salamu alaykum\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Young Jeezy]\nThese pussy niggas only talkin' cause they got lips\nGuess them choppers only bustin' cause them bitches got clips (YEEEAH~!)\nGot them niggas bustin' off the motorcycle like Chips (haha)\nThink I seen them round Bloods, so they mighta been Crips\nAll this rappin' ain't no action, see I can't respect that (nah)\nBout to ask him for that trap, and nigga I'mma check that (DAAAMN)\nHundred units in the living room, and you can bet that\nI'm so high up in this bitch look like I got a jet pack (WHOO)\nIf you a real street nigga, won't you tell me how it feel\nSo bought some 26s before you played her like Bill\nSo keep your name up out your mouth, gives a fuck bout how you feel\nCause in these motherfuckin' streets, +I Am Legend+ like Will\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Ludacris]\nThese niggas is sweeter than a sweet potato, softer than Play-Doh, hope bitch nigga, lay low\nA-Town by the way of Illinois and our blocks come together like Legos, they know\nWho I am, I'm the man with a plane and a nigga with verses, blowin' a rapper to pieces\nGot a crew full of untamed dogs, and I'm thinkin' that I'm really bout to let 'em off the leashes (WOOF)\nI'm scratchin the surface, the nigga with the million dollar verses (WHOO)\nThese rappers are worthless and all I really wanna do is piss 'em off on purpose\nI'm possessed, stick a needle in your back like a nigga doing voodoo curses\nGivin' them a two piece with a biscuit and hell no I ain't talkin 'bout churches (OHHH)\nGet nervous, get robbed of your valuables nigga like I'm snatching your purses\nAnd I got a couple urges to clown on you niggas like a three ring circus\nIf you ain't got no warrants, then you best to believe it'll be no searches\nSo keep my name up out your mouth before I close your curtains\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "War With God", "album": "Release Therapy", "year": null, "lyrics": "[Intro]\nThe time has come...for bad things to end\nThe time has come...for life to begin\nThe time has come...for the war of the gods\n\nYes, it's that time\nI'mma take the subtle approach first\nCause I'm just gettin started\nLet's go\n\n[Verse 1]\nLook, I'm the best and there's nothing that you can do about it\nNever needed a publicity stunt, let's tell the truth about it\nEven in the core of the streets, you can't sway the youth about it\nBut keep runnin yo mouth, and I swear I'mma knock a tooth up out it\nI never claimed to be nuthin but who the fuck I am\nNever sold cocaine in my life, but I'm still the fuckin man\nUnderstand, nuthin you did makes you better nigga\nYou claim the streets, but the streets respect that chedda nigga\nLuda got twice as much yo life you can charge it to 'em\nI fit four of your houses inside my daughters room\nAnd still have room for young Karma to play\nGivin back to the children of tommorrow, for good karma today\nSo you can say whatcha wanna say, and you can talk that talk\nBut real niggas ain't doin no talkin cause we walk that walk\nAlbum for album you can see I got a multimillion plan\nSo call yourself whatever you want cept the multimillion man\n\n[Hook: Ludacris over woman singing]\nWhatever you want except the multi-million man, nigga\nCall yourself whatever you want except the million man, nigga (2X)\n(How many, man)\n\n[Verse 2]\nHow many times is you gon rap about busting your gun\nHow many times is you gon trap without busting your gun\nOnly shots you ever took were subliminal to the general\nDisrespectin those doin real time with real criminals\nAnd I ain't never did a day in my life\nBut it should be illegal to walk a day in my life\nI paid the price and the cost to be the boss so you can rest your mouth\nI'm universal, Luda never limits himself to the south\nI give a damn about ya hootin and hollerin, and it ain't botherin ME\nI hear you talkin but you ain't made it to THREE\nYou know where I live, but you ain't made it to ME\nYou ain't made nigga\nI'm havin a house party, kid come get played nigga\nYou got played, my record label never jerked me\nSo shoot me, stab me, but words will never hurt me\nI feed off your energy, my powers with God\nSo it's even better if you make ya diss record real hard...\n\n[Hook: Ludacris over woman singing]\nMake the record real hard (2X)\nYa diss record real hard\n\n[Verse 3]\nSee even without all that bass and treble, I'm as hot as the devil\nBut I work for the top floor, homie get on my level\nI'm being stripped away of powers because I gave you my blessing\nSo it'll take more than majority vote to win this election\nMan, mixtapes are not my resume, it's too hot\nAnd I warned them I was coming, I got that number 1 spot\nSo unless you using tampons, quit acting stuck up\nAnd do like your records say, or shut the FUCK up\n\n[Hook: Ludacris]\nDo like your records say, or shut the fuck up (2X)\nShut the fuck up", "image":

begin\nThe time has come...for the war of the gods\n\nYes, it's that time\nI'mma take the subtle approach first\nCause I'm just gettin started\nLet's go\n\n[Verse 1]\nLook, I'm the best and there's nothing that you can do about it\nNever needed a publicity stunt, let's tell the truth about it\nEven in the core of the streets, you can't sway the youth about it\nBut keep runnin yo mouth, and I swear I'mma knock a tooth up out it\nI never claimed to be nuthin but who the fuck I am\nNever sold cocaine in my life, but I'm still the fuckin man\nUnderstand, nuthin you did makes you better nigga\nYou claim the streets, but the streets respect that chedda nigga\nLuda got twice as much yo life you can charge it to 'em\nI fit four of your houses inside my daughters room\nAnd still have room for young Karma to play\nGivin back to the children of tommorrow, for good karma today\nSo you can say whatcha wanna say, and you can talk that talk\nBut real niggas ain't doin no talkin cause we walk that walk\nAlbum for album you can see I got a multimillion plan\nSo call yourself whatever you want cept the multimillion man\n\n[Hook: Ludacris over woman singing]\nWhatever you want except the multi-million man, nigga\nCall yourself whatever you want except the million man, nigga (2X)\n(How many, man)\n\n[Verse 2]\nHow many times is you gon rap about busting your gun\nHow many times is you gon trap without busting your gun\nOnly shots you ever took were subliminal to the general\nDisrespectin those doin real time with real criminals\nAnd I ain't never did a day in my life\nBut it should be illegal to walk a day in my life\nI paid the price and the cost to be the boss so you can rest your mouth\nI'm universal, Luda never limits himself to the south\nI give a damn about ya hootin and hollerin, and it ain't botherin ME\nI hear you talkin but you ain't made it to THREE\nYou know where I live, but you ain't made it to ME\nYou ain't made nigga\nI'm havin a house party, kid come get played nigga\nYou got played, my record label never jerked me\nSo shoot me, stab me, but words will never hurt me\nI feed off your energy, my powers with God\nSo it's even better if you make ya diss record real hard...\n\n[Hook: Ludacris over woman singing]\nMake the record real hard (2X)\nYa diss record real hard\n\n[Verse 3]\nSee even without all that bass and treble, I'm as hot as the devil\nBut I work for the top floor, homie get on my level\nI'm being stripped away of powers because I gave you my blessing\nSo it'll take more than majority vote to win this election\nMan, mixtapes are not my resume, it's too hot\nAnd I warned them I was coming, I got that number 1 spot\nSo unless you using tampons, quit acting stuck up\nAnd do like your records say, or shut the FUCK up\n\n[Hook: Ludacris]\nDo like your records say, or shut the fuck up (2X)\nShut the fuck up"}}, {"title": "Phat Rabbit", "album": "Back for the First Time", "year": "2000-10-17", "lyrics": "[Verse : Ludacris]\nI be that nigga named Luda\nA.K.A. L-O-V-A, L-O-V-A\nFuck that shit, nigga what you wanna say one time\nSouthside let's ride (say what)\nAnd if you love what you do, do what you feel\nThen I know you gonna mark my words\nI drop shit like birds\nAnd it's about the time for yo' ass to get served\nJust lay it on down, just lay it on down\nWhile we relax to the tight raps, and the fat tracks\nThat a nigga Timbaland put down\nOh yes, let's get it on down to the nitty grit\nDon't have time for the petty shit\nCause I got mo' dick, than a lil' bit\nAnd time flies, when I'm havin' fun\nI can make a ho get like Forrest Gump and just \"run baby run\"\nI guess that they can't handle this\nThe brother's just too scandalous\nIf you don't wanna get freaked\nGet up out my way just like in an ambulance (say what)\nGitty up gitty up ride on to the real, lay in death to the fake\nAnd tell your boyfriend just to chill, don't player hate!\nKick back relax and just take off yo' shoes\nWhile I gotta tell you what I wants to do (uh oh)\nYeah\n\n[Chorus: Timbaland]\nLet me touch it (let me touch it)\nLet me feel it (let me feel it)\nLet me grab it (let me grab it)\nThat fat rabbit (fat rabbit, fat rabbit, fat rabbit)\nLet me

nappy dug out\nGet the cut up, then I cut out\nWhy you standin there wit yo' butt out (whoo)\nAnd it's always in the back of my mind\nWhatever the place, whatever the time\nEven in College Park after dark I'ma get that sunshine\nCloser than close, closer than most, then I'm all up in ya\nBut beginners give me a thigh, breast, and leg like Mrs. Winter\nAnd let dinner be served\nCan I get it on a platter, shatter your bladder\nAnd put so much light in yo' life I'll make the roaches scatter\nThe wetta the betta, I'm ready to get ya\nGotta have that rabbit like that cheddar\nSo I can freak you like I just met ya\nHot like a sauna get comfy like in a Cadillac\nNick nack paddy wack, give a dog a bone Jack\nKick back relax and just take off yo' shoes\nWhile I gotta tell you what I wants to do

butta like a biscuit\nReminisce like Mary, I gotta pop that cherry\nKinda like that coochie, you wanna be my hoochie?\nBetter than my adversary\nDon't be so scary\nI, never thought that you could act up\nMake a nigga wanna back up\nKeep it tight through the night while I wet this track up\nSo we can slip and slide, make you wanna dip and dive\nTrippin while we rip and ride, 'til I get you to cum inside\nGot you where I want yo' ass\nIn the case of an emergency, break the glass\nKeep yo eyes on the present and erase the past\nAnd be happy if we got mo' blunts to pass\nGet done up and run up\nIn the guts 'til yo' butt don't shake like it used to\nI wake 'em up like a rooster\nTake it slow, not faster than a turbo booster\nNo worry, no hurry - no pain, no gain\nBetter keep yo' eyes on strain\nCause ain't a damn thing changed, mayn\nSit back, relax and just take off yo shoes\nWhile I gotta tell you what I wants to do (uh oh)\nYeah\n\n[Chorus: Timbaland]\nLet me touch it (let me

sluts\nGive me a full-body massage, I still can't be touched\nThey call me Seymour Butz, 'cause I get more ass than most\nThey say I'm Next and got that Butta Love, and get Too Close\nFollow the leader 'cause I'm meaner than abdullah oblongata\nMy Tribe's on more Quests than Midnight Marauders\nIt's all pi\u00f1a coladas, no cops and robbers\nTaking trips back and forth from here to the Bahamas\nI hump more than llamas, get rolled more than tires\nIf you say I'm not nice, then you's a motherfucking liar!\nEntitled to your opinion, into the next millennium\nSo many Major Coinz that I thought I had Amil-ion\n\n[Verse 2: 4-IZE]\nYo, I am going to blow up the Earth\nWith my Q-36 Explosive Space Modulator\nBuddha be praised, you meditator\nDrop Squad interrogator, 85 percent

Stallone\nPsychic prediction, Egyptian description\nOf my physical, my flesh is weak and it's pitiful\nSpiritual is hooked up to the invisible\nUmbilical cord of my Lord, Kumbiya Devine Kah\nRemove paper of tar from every cigar\nI slap authority like Gabor, Zsa Zsa\nHalf Allah, Half Antichrist Superstar\nRocking the microphone with a hand like Dr. Claw\nWhile I'm hitting trees harder than Sonny Bono\nDouble Dragon, mixed up with an Abobo\nI kill villains in slow-mo for talking crazy in my dojo\nGot nothing to lose, like I'm a boxcar hobo\nWhen I get Ludacris with Bridges on the promo\nNiggas wanna clown, I'm Homey and Bozo\n'Cause in the Grand Prize Game, my Life Calling like Jo Jo\nThe name sticks like pogo\nI keep it realer than alien autopsy photo\nYou similar to a Spice Girl going solo\nYou lost like BeBe, or a dog named Toto\nMy statue of liberty is Rebecca Lobo\nWe Cop Robo, Virgo\nBust ass like a motherfucking homo, como estas?\nTony Del Negro, built to destroy these kids' blocks of Legos\nL'eggo my Eggo 'cause I say so\nHold the microphone, 4-Ize, I stay gifted\nManifested, elevated, I uplifted\nThe elevator, the escalator, \"That's not a knife?\nThat's a knife!\" Crocodile Dundee, the alligator rustler\n'Cause I hustle ya, under the China\nBig Trouble, little sewer, but still I find ya\n'Cause I'm stinky, manifest, throw you down the stairs like a slinky\nYo,

thinking bout killing my boss today\nKilling my boss today\nI'm thinking bout killing my boss today (it's just a thought man)\nKilling my boss today (yeah)\n\nYesterday my best friend died (died)\nSomebody came and took his life (life)\nNow I'm looking up at the sky\nHave you ever seen a grown man cry?\nAnd I'm asking why did you take him away?\nWhy did you take him away?\nI'm asking

(I need my music, man!)\nStereo's taken away? (hey!)\n\nGas prices are way too high\nRich people are way too fly\nAnd I'm where I wanna be in my life\nBut why am I so behind?\nIs it cause I'm wasting my time away?\nWasting my time away?\nIs it cause I'm wasting my time away? (too lazy)\nWasting my time away? (I can't help it!)\n\nMy grandmama's nerves are bad (bad)\nAnd everybody in the hood is mad (mad)\nCause President Bush could give a damn about our ass\nSo I don't wanna hear shit that he has to say (don't say nothing!)\nShit that he has to say\nI don't wanna hear shit that he has to say\nShit that he has to say (woo!)\n\nTroops gone and we still at war (war)\nNobody even really knows what for (what for)\nEven more I'm scared to find what the world really has in store\nCause you know that tomorrow's not promised today (it's not promised, man)\nTomorrow's not promised today\nCause you know that tomorrow's not promised today (live like today could be your last, man!)\nTomorrow's not promised today (hey!)\n\n[Hook 4X]"}}, {"title": "She A Trip", "album": "#IDGAF", "year": null, "lyrics": "[Sample: Conversation between couple]\n\"Why haven't I heard from you?\"\n\"I been busy.\"\n\"Well, have you at least thought about what we talked about?\"\n\"Yeah, about leaving with you?

crying in the night, hearing arguments\nHands off my momma, somehow I knew he was the cause of it\nGot a little older and he got a little worse\nDrinking must be his remedy, he got a little

Would have made him even sicker\nCause who gon' tell him he can't drink none of his son's liquor\nAnd tell me without my father how am I supposed to manage?\nHe had the biggest heart, but also had

critical condition right now\nI appreciate your prayers\nMr. Wayne Bridges\nI love you\n\n[Ludacris Talking]\nRest in peace Wayne Bridges\nYou're still living through me\nListen\n\n[Verse 1: Ludacris]\nLook, I lost my father to the bottle\nI'd hug him everyday like I might not see him tomorrow\nGot a enough sorrow for a lifetime\nCause when he was living I'm thinking how do I get him to listen\nWhen he was seldom in his right mind\nMy early years I was too young to understand\nBut I remember the smell of beer and seeing all the empty cans\nWaking up, crying in the night, hearing arguments\nHands off my momma, somehow I knew he was the cause of it\nGot a little older and he got a little worse\nDrinking must be his remedy, he got a little cursed\nWell, tell me what's the cure for a man who miss his pops\nThe beat goes on, but the drinking's gotta stop\n\n[Hook: Monica]\nIf I had have know I wouldn't see you tomorrow\nI would've had you hold to your heart, and put your love in a bottle, hey\nBut now you got me drunk out that pain,  gone after sorrow\nWishing every day you were here with me\nBut now that you're gone, I lost my heart to the bottle, to the bottle\nOoh oh oh\n\n[Verse 2: Ludacris]\nYeah, I lost my father to the bottle\nFunctioning alcoholics what they call it far as I know\nBecame a teenager and started to understand\nBut even through drinks he still taught me to be a man\nSo before the hospital, where the paramedics rushed him\nAny and  everybody who met him, instantly loved him\nIronic how conjure Would have made him even sicker\nCause who gon' tell him he can't drink none of his son's liquor\nAnd tell me without my father how am I supposed to manage?\nHe had the biggest heart, but also had that liver damage\nTell me what's the cure for a man who miss his pops\nThe beat goes on, but the drinking' gotta stop\n\n[Hook: Monica]\nIf I had have know I wouldn't see you tomorrow\nI would've had you hold to your heart, and put your love in a bottle, hey\nBut now you got me drunk out that pain,  gone after sorrow\nWishing every day you were here with me\nBut now that you're gone, I lost my heart to the bottle, to the bottle\nOoh oh oh\n\n[Bridge: Monica]\nNot a day goes by that I don't miss ya, and don't wish you were here with me\nNo matter what you did, I forgive you\n\n[Verse 3: Ludacris]\nI lost my father to the bottle\nTell your parents you love 'em\nYou might not see them tomorrow\nI swallow my pride, try to put my problems aside\nBut I feel so hollow inside\nGotta keep my eyes on the prize\nCause I'm steady wishing you were here\nTo see the goals that I plan to reach\nYou left the day after I put you into my Grammy speech\nIt's almost like you waited just to see me win\nWell, pops I can't wait until the day we meet again\n\n[Hook: Monica]\nIf I had have know I wouldn't see you tomorrow\nI would've had you hold to your heart, and put your love in a bottle, hey\nBut now you got me drunk out that pain,  gone after sorrow\nWishing every day you were here with me\nBut now that you're gone, I lost my heart to the bottle, to the bottle\nOoh oh oh\n\n[Outro: Monica]\nI can't get over you you you, hey\nLove in a bottle, hey heyyy\nOh, I miss you\nI wanna see you tomorrow\nI wanna see you again\nI wanna see you tomorrow\nI miss you, you you you you\nI love you, you you you"}}, {"title": "Get Lit", "album":

hate\nThey on the taste for the (money)\nNow where do I begin? They send you out to reel you back in\nAnd its all for the (money)\nCause envy breeds jealousy, jealousy breeds hate\nThey on the taste for the (money)\n\n[Verse 1: Ludacris]\nMy biggest gift and my curse\nMore money, more problems tell me what's worse\nGetting audited by the government, giving up millions to the IRS\nOr having to take a paternity test from a bitch I never met\nI'm getting sued by my own family member, all cause my dog bit her\nAnd she was the one who walked up and put her hand out, and now she got her handout\nIt's driving me crazy, almost as if this shit was planned out\nWhat else can anybody do to me? It ain't new to me when every time I turn around\nAnother money hungry motherfucker suing me\nTruthfully, I've had it up to here\nAnd it don't help that Forbes reports what I'm makin every year\nThey listen closely, and I was really demonized\nThat I was told to go to school, graduate and get a job\nBut I'm a Hip Hop cash king, rapper from the South\nAnd everybody wants the easy way out\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Ludacris]\nYeah, rappers foreclosin' on their houses\nCan't keep up the payments, they owe a couple hundred thousand\nSay they making millions, and bills steady pillin'\nDiamonds on their neck, they kids' stomach out here growlin\nGet your priorities in order nigga\nYou talk about it, but you really can't afford it nigga\nThat car you bought depreciated once you drove off\nNo wonder your baby momma wanna knock your nose off (BLAHHH)\nHalf the industry going bankrupt\nYou see em' smiling in the club with their drinks up\nDon't let that television fool ya\nOff camera they sweating and stressin\nMy young students, let me school ya\nThe diamonds ain't worth half what you bought them for (no)\nSoon all that Gucci don't fit, now you out of dough\nOne day your pocket's alright now they all wrong\nFuck you gonn' do when it's all gone\nTalkin bout the\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Rick Ross]\nLemme talk to these hoes, woadie\nUhh, uh\nImagine being worth a 100 mill\nYour potentials of having a billion is only real\nImages, more bitches and they named in your will\nA new Mercedes, a baby, your aim was to chill\nYou choose a pussy or pop a bottle, grow half a mill\nAll you wanted was some entertainment\nAll she wanted was some litigation\nExploiting a simple penetration\nTelling the courtroom that I'm being evasive\nShe wanted to walk into the SunTrust\nShe made me sign over my lil son's trust\nTake away the joy my lil daughter brings\nBitch even wanted to take my daughter's rings\nMisfortunes of a rich nigga\nYou watch BET while she look at the big picture\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "Everybody Drunk", "album": "Battle of the Sexes", "year": "2010-09-24", "lyrics": "[Intro/Hook: 8Ball sample]\nE'rybody with me drunk as fuck, break it down and roll it up\nE'rybody with me drunk as fuck, break it down and roll it up\nE'rybody with me drunk as fuck, break it down and roll it up\nE'rybody with me drunk as fuck, break it down and roll it up\nE'rybody with me drunk as fuck, break it down and roll it up\nE'rybody with me drunk as fuck, break it down and roll it up\nE'rybody with me drunk as fuck, break it down and roll it up\nE'rybody with me drunk as fuck, break it down and roll it up\nE'rybody with me drunk as fuck, break it down and roll it up\n\n[Ludacris]\nOkay oh, okay now e'rybody with me drunk as FUCK, break it down and \"roll it up\"\nYeah, e'rybody get they killers wit 'em, rep yo' side and throw it up\nPo' it up and it's goin down, light another blunt and it's goin 'round\nPuff puff pass, you could toast yo' glass, later we'll screw and slow it up\nIf you make it fast I can make it last, and I'm a nigga that's makin cash\nEight figures in the bank and I'll pull yo' rank, what you think wit your hatin ass?\nHee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee - heh, you think you fly I know you not\nHee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee - you tote yo' knife I tote my Glock\nBig body Cadillac, women in the back seat, speakers steady pumpin as I pass these losers\nYo' car too small, I can't fit my women in a PT Cruiser\nGet your cake up, get your weight up, way up to the top 'til you can't go further\nThese snitches is after my riches and yes I smell bloody murder\nWhen I cock back better drop that, can't block that lock that, fools better stop that\nOtherwise you could pop back, but after dumpin' a round you'll be wonderin where the cops at\nWhere the cops at?

Thank all y'all for coming out tonight\nIt was a beautiful night tonight at The Shizznit\nWhere pimping ain't dead, these hoes just scared\nThanks Snoop Dogg, Ludacris, all the players from the LBC\nIt was a beautiful night tonight\nOh, look at these fools, Ay! Security! Come get these niggas!\n\n[Verse 1 - Luda] + (Snoop)\nFresh off the streets, just finished a show in Long Beach\nReady to relax, kick up my feet\nMaybe smoke a blunt or two, that's what I wanna do\nBroke out and called up the homeboy Snoop (What happenin' nephew?)\nOh, nothing just called, looking for some women how can fondle my balls\n(Well you hit the right dogg, I can help you with that\nGimme 15 minutes, and I'll hit you rite back)\nOff to the hotel, I was ready indeed\nSlapped the button in the 'llac to control the speed\nPut one up in the air, the cops just stared\nWaved my hands out the roof like I just ain't care\nGot to the tele and I slid through the door\nOn to the elevator, hit the penthouse floor\nAnd what would happen next only time could tell\nCuz I got up to my room, and I was mad as hell (Aaah!

Nigga make 'em bail (Yeah)\nGot some fine bitches, dime bitches on they way (Okay)\nAnd told security, \"Let 'em in, with no delay\" (Ha Ha!)\nSo when they get here, they'll probably be like half naked\nDon't mean to trip out, but bitch y'all got to dip out (Dip Out!)\nCatch the elevator on more floor\nPresidential with the sliding key for the door (Oh No!)\nWhat the fuck going on?\nShit, all around the world Luda, then it's the same song\nThem bitches was so ugly, I told 'em to go home\n\n[Hook]\nWho let these hoes in my room?\n(Man who let these hoes in my room?)\nWho let these hoes in my room? (Oh no!)\n(Did you let 'em in?)\nWho let these hoes in my room?\n(Well who let 'em in then?)\nWho let these hoes in my room?

lean)\nDiamond in the, diamond in the, diamond in the...\n\n[Verse 1]\nIt's hard growin' up lookin' at drug dealers wit' all this paper\nWonderin' how I can get me some\nMy family's strugglin', I'm buggin', sittin' on my porch\nSo confused, chewin' on some bubblegum\nI was always taught to use my manners with the misses\nBut please, stay away from the hoes and snitches\nAnd I was always reached for the sky, I dont know why\nIma little bitty kid wit' a whole buncha gangsta wishes\nWhen I grow up, you just wait, Ima be so straight\nAnd everything's gonna be so marvelous\nNo more borrowin' from the neighbors, no more haters\nNo more blowin' Nintendo cartridges\nIma have it made in the shade, Ima be so paid\nAnd my fam, get 'em off that payin' them bills\nMatta fact Im schemin' my way on up out this hood, I'll be good\nWhen I ditch these trainin' wheels\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm sick and tired of ridin' public transportation\nBeen patient waitin' on my set of wheels\nI'm willin' to do what it takes, whatever the stakes\nIn order to get myself some dollar bills\nIt's too many holes in my socks, and I'm ready to box\nAnyone tellin' me I need better shoes\nAnd I ain't the only one trippin', or makin a fuss\nMy older cousin need some cheddar too\nHe thinkin' 'bout comin' up on the lick, to get it quick\nIt involves that local corner store\nI overheard him say he knew who works there\nAnd whatever they do, dont let the owner know\nI hope he come back with enough to let me borrow some change\nAt least for the summer\nAnd if he dont let me borrow nothin, but ask me what I want\nIma tell him I wanna...\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhy can't I walk with a limp mama? won't be no drama\nFor goodness sakes, Im just a kid\nHad to get my whoopin' in fo's, I was just a po'\nLike there no remorse for what I did\nGotta learn the hard way, when runnin' them streets\nHow some just creep, really just to eat a meal\n\"I coulda swore it was mine,\" what I used to tell the po-pos\nWhat I left to rob and steal\nMan, I gotta earn for a livin', ain't nobody givin' me nothin'\nFind somethin' I love to do\nHmm, what about that pimpin'? It's good tippin'\nTax free, and I know a lot of people that love to screw\nYeah, it's just a way of the world, with boys and girls\nI'm adjustin' to my environment\nThis government cheatin' us, so I'll cheat 'em back\nWhy can't work feel like retirement?\n\n[Hook]\n\nGangsta, gangsta, gangsta..."}}, {"title": "Do Sumthing Strange", "album": "1.21 Gigawatts: Back To the First Time", "year":

chick\nGets that ride or die puddin' for that ride or die dick\nI say they wanna talk to ya, so shut up and listen (yeah)\nIf you can't take the heat, then get the fuck out the kitchen\n'Cause a ride or die man for his ride or die chick\nGets that ride or die puddin' for that ride or die dick\n\n[Chorus: Chris Brown, Sean Garrett & (Ludacris)]\nI know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls\nI know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like (hahaha, yeah)\nI know what they feel 'cause I'm breathin' on they heels\nAnd it's me they wanna kill 'cause I give them what the girls like (they wanna go on vacation and I know it, let's go)\nI know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls\nI know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like\nI know what they feel 'cause I'm breathin' on they heels (yes)\nHey (they want what they can't have)\nAnd it's me they wanna kill 'cause I give them what the girls like\nYeah, yeah (haha, yeah)\n\n[Outro: Ludacris & Chris Brown]\nWomen, I love you all, there's not enough time\nBelieve that, if your man don't tell you how beautiful you are (hey, yeah)\nI'm lettin' you know right damn now, you are beautiful, baby\nOh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh\nI love women so much, I have one\nLuda, Chris Breezy, this too easy\nOh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh\nSG what up", "image":

grab yourself a seat and a whiskey double\nBecause the girls of the world ain't nothin' but trouble\nThey like a little danger and might not admit it (yeah)\nBut they on for the chase and they want us to come and get it\nPlus they love a young thug that's overflowin' with swag\nAnd keeps his woman all draped in new Louis Vuitton bags (hey)\nAnd Louis Vuitton pumps, look at her walk to him (yeah)\nI like open toe straps, but SG talk to him\nI got a whole bunch of girls I'm tryna bring by the crib tonight (yeah)\nBetter wear your cape 'cause the bringin' that kryptonite (okay)\n\n[Chorus: Chris

makes you psychotic\nHere's a triple black card, it ain't trickin' if you got it (hey)\nOthers will stay content if you just makin' 'em laugh\nSend 'em to the spa, get 'em massaged and bubble bathed\nSo later on they can dance and throw a drink in they hand\nAnd try every and anythin' they never did with they man, me\nSo get loose and slide off ya damn garments (hey)\nShow 'em who's the boss, they take orders from the sergeant\nThere's places on your body that I'm just tryin' to find\nSo in the sack, talk to me, tell me whats on your mind (woo!)\nAn I got plenty more to learn if you's investin' in me (okay)\nThey don't love for who I am but who I destined to be\nAnd for that, I'd give you everythin' up under the sun\n'Cause in the end all the girls just wanna have

I mean how did he think of that?\nI mean how did I think of that? Now like a rental, bring it back\nI mean how did I think of that? I surprise myself sometimes\nSomeone should throw me a surprise party for every rhyme\nEvery time I do it, I do it dirty like swine\nFor the dirty and fine, hip-hop, I'm alive!\n\n[Hook Two: Lil

amazing speeds\nWe on that Superman kush or that amazing weed\nThe new Bentley came out, my team said, \"Luda, get it!\"\n20 thou' says that I'm the only nigga wit it!\nNew Era on yo' brain like a A-town fitted\nAnd I'm not E-40 but I'm so Sick Wid It\nThat my flow got the flu, hoes I got a few\nBut I'm stingy with the dough, I'm like \"No not for you!\"\nWhat the fuck was you thinkin, off what I'm thinkin\nMe and Wayne on that lean, what the FUCK was you drinkin?\nStinkin like a dead body off in the woods\nSo I snatched her like a weave comin off in the hood\nAnd if you down for no bad,

try to tell em that it all just depends\nCause everytime I make a lil more money\nI seem to be losing more of my friends\nSo I'd give it all up to repeat life over\nAnd they'd say dude is a fool\nI can't trust another motherfucker living in this world\nAnd this really got me losing my cool\nWhat would you'd do if you were in my situation\nAnd the minute everyone you ever loved to say you looked up\nYou drink your pain to the bottom of a bottle\nAnd the Conjure would have you fucked up\nSo I'm looking for love in all the wrong places\nPop pills, drink liquor by the cases\nGet high, make a woman get low\nIn the strip club looking for familiar faces\nPeople know me on a first name basis\nBut all they ever really want is my cash\nLet me borrow just a couple hundred dollars\nAnd you know that I'm a pay you back, my ass\nThis world so superficial\nThis world done lost my trust\nThey say Ludacris you've changing\nBut I really don't give a fuck\nWhat the hell am I suppose to think?\nWhat the hell am I suppose to do?\nI'm hearing that the devil's in disguise\nAnd I'm hearing that the nigga look just like you\nThey know I walk throw the valley of the shadow of death\nI don't go astray\nAnd I get down on my knees and pray and I say\n\n[Hook: Cee-Lo Green and Ludacris]\n(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away\n(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away, away, away\nI wish my problems would go away, away, away\n\n[Verse 2: Ludacris]\nDoc said I need to change my diet, cause I'm really not eating right\nMama said I need some peace and quiet, cause I'm really not sleeping right\nWhat's the use of having all the money\nAnd the power in the world, if I can't abuse it?\nSeems like the only thing that's keeping me together, is my music\nIf it wasn't for that, I think I would lose it\nIf it wasn't for that, I would go crazy\nWhen nobody went good on they word\nIn the industry they make you feel like, \"Fuck you, pay me!\"\nCause I gotta feed family, some of the same ones that abandoned me\nThat still looking for a hand out\nTil you found out there ain't shit ya handed me\nHah, still mad at me? But I'm trying to be the man I plan to be\nBut can't do it if you calling me for dumb shit\nThinking I'm innocent, I'm a plea insanity\nToo many distractions and it feels like everyday\nSo I get down on my knees and pray and I say\n\n[Hook: Cee-Lo Green and Ludacris]\n(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away\n(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away, away, away\nI wish my problems would go away, away, away\n\n[Verse 3: Ludacris]\nI finally made it to the top of the CEO position\nBut when things don't go their way, these artists got all these suspicions\nSo the weed keep me at peace, and I think I need an intervention\nWho the fuck put me in charge of making all of these decisions\nMy position got me stressing, like it never did before\nNot to mention my best friend drowned and death was knocking at his door\nAnd it seems like someone in my family is passing away like every day\nSo I just look up to the sky and get down on my knees and pray and I say\n\n[Hook: Cee-Lo Green and Ludacris]\n(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away\n(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away, away, away\nI wish my problems would go away, away, away"}}, {"title": "Go 2 Sleep", "album": "Word of Mouf", "year": "2001-11-27", "lyrics": "[Hook 3x]\n[Ludacris, Infamous 2-0 and Three 6 Mafia (Ludacris solo)]\nGo to sleep, ho!

(Go to sleep!)\n\n[Verse 1: Ludacris]\nMaaan, I tell a ho to go to sleep (go to sleep)\nThey turn around and frown, gotta make them six feet deep\nCause we knock them unconscious with that nonsense\nRead in between that fine print, think about lyrical content\nThen about where your time spent\nMess around get your guys hit; a-ten hut\nI send Three Six -- oh shee-ot, nigga what?\nIf you're tired, you're tired; if you snooze, you lose\nBut'chu you won't wrap up ya bandages, or heal your wounds\n\n[Verse 2: Infamous 2-0]\nNigga, I got shotties and semis -- I love 'dro and Henny\nAll brown and skinny, but I've fucked up so many\nI got QP's and halves - if we beefin', I blast\nYou sleepin' I laugh, ask 'Cris, I'm off the rip\nI had this ho who talked too much; I had to off the bitch\n2-0, Mr. Crayola; niggas know what I mean\nCause I slang brown, white, yellow, purple and green\nAnd all you faggot motherfuckers gotta know the routine\n\n[Hook 4x]\n\n[Verse 3:

Orange Mound\nNigga we be smokin' life; never Ch-Ch-Charlie Brown\nMemphis niggas in this bitch; pockets full, ya know we bail\nHooked up with my nigga 'Cris, then we head to A-T-L\nPlayas wild,

What the hell is goin on?\nI'm tryin to ease back and get my head in the zone\n(Then where the fuck you tryin to go?) Nigga this yo' city\nAnywhere, I'm just tryin to see some ass and titties\nSo fool mash the gas, the night is young\nAll bullshit aside I'm tryin to have some fun\nHit the hop in Lakewood, or ride down Slauson\nOr the casino, they say it's just like Compton (ha ha)\nReally doesn't matter, long as shots don't rang out\n(Nigga I stay strapped, I don't wanna pull the thang out)\nWell keep the heat heat right up under the seat\nAnd let's roll to Roscoe's and grab somethin to eat\nBut check your rearview mirror, I swear somebody's followin\nRollin in that dark blue SS Impala and\nAll up on the bumper, man I'm just sayin\nTell me you know this nigga (nah, they better stop playin)\nHe sped up around and drove right in front of us\nCould be one-time just tryin to bust one of us\n'Til he smashed the brakes and we almost hit him\nThrowin signs out the window like somethin was wrong wit him\nBefore we jump out and get ready to clown\n(Nigga call up the homies, it's about to go down)\n\n[Hook: Ludacris] + (The Game)\nKeep one eye open cause the streets don't sleep\n(If the streets get hungry then the streets gon' eat)\nThat's why I keep some heat and a couple of rounds, nigga\n(Call up the homies, it's about to go down)\nCall up the homies, it's about to go down?\n(Yeah, call up the homies, it's about to go down)\nYeah that's why I keep some heat and a couple of rounds\nNigga call up the homies, it's about to go DOWN\n\n[The Game] + (Ludacris)\nSomebody tell Luda I'm on the way now (aight)\nJust stepped one size 12 Air Force 1 in the A-Town (ha ha ha)\nAnd you know where I'm headed\nTo the Lennox Mall to get it done head to toe NWA style (do it)\nKeep it gangsta from the waist down\nAnd this chrome trey-pound got me feelin Atlanta +Brave+ now (right)\nDisturbin' Tha Peace, I'll let the lead spray\nI'm startin to love this place, they even got Red Clay (okay)\nHit a different strip club e'ry day (yeah)\nAnd I don't make it rain, it's a hurricane on the way (ha ha ha)\nAnd I got the A-Town pump\nIt'll make your whole body do the A-Town stomp (woo!)\nThen it's off to the Waffle House\nAnd pancake mix ain't the only thing comin out her mouth\nAnd her 42 D's comin out her blouse\nHer baby daddy comin in (Game, get out the house, and)\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Ludacris]\nYeah, I'm in a real-life movie, so this is take three\nWhen Luda step foot out in Phoenix, A-Z\nSuperbowl super hoes, rappers on stroll\nSo I put the call in to Willy Northpole\n\n[Willy Northpole] + (Ludacris)\nWoo, big homie I got ya, stick to you like a cactus\nWelcome to the Bird City, Chris, take off your jacket\nI know you kinda used to big booties in the club\nBut ain't nothin wrong to have a lil' sauce in your blood\nI see a couple thugs with some bitch tendencies\nMy town, but I still got Phoenix enemies (yup)\nHaters wanna stop 'em and I really wanna pop 'em\nBut it's hard to fight back when you got an album droppin (connects)\nWe in South Phoenix, niggas Africa bang\nMatter fact, Chris, tuck in your Africa chain (what?)\nCause I see some niggas starin at us with a lame frown\nI'mma call up the homies (it's about to go DOWN)\n\n[Hook/Outro:

whattup nigga?) What the hell is goin on?\nI'm tryin to ease back and get my head in the zone\n(Then where the fuck you tryin to go?) Nigga this yo' city\nAnywhere, I'm just tryin to see some ass and titties\nSo fool mash the gas, the night is young\nAll bullshit aside I'm tryin to have some fun\nHit the hop in Lakewood, or ride down Slauson\nOr the casino, they say it's just like Compton (ha ha)\nReally doesn't matter, long as shots don't rang out\n(Nigga I stay strapped, I don't wanna pull the thang out)\nWell keep the heat heat right up under the seat\nAnd let's roll to Roscoe's and grab somethin to eat\nBut check your rearview mirror, I swear somebody's followin\nRollin in that dark blue SS Impala and\nAll up on the bumper, man I'm just sayin\nTell me you know this nigga (nah, they better stop playin)\nHe sped up around and drove right in front of us\nCould be one-time just tryin to bust one of us\n'Til he smashed the brakes and we almost hit him\nThrowin signs out the window like somethin was wrong wit him\nBefore we jump out and get ready to clown\n(Nigga call up the homies, it's about to go down)\n\n[Hook: Ludacris] + (The Game)\nKeep one eye open cause the streets don't sleep\n(If the streets get hungry then the streets gon' eat)\nThat's why I keep some heat and a couple of rounds, nigga\n(Call up the homies, it's about to go down)\nCall up the homies, it's about to go down?\n(Yeah, call up the homies, it's about to go down)\nYeah that's why I keep some heat and a couple of rounds\nNigga call up the homies, it's about to go DOWN\n\n[The Game] + (Ludacris)\nSomebody tell Luda I'm on the way now (aight)\nJust stepped one size 12 Air Force 1 in the A-Town (ha ha ha)\nAnd you know where I'm headed\nTo the Lennox Mall to get it done head to toe NWA style (do it)\nKeep it gangsta from the waist down\nAnd this chrome trey-pound got me feelin Atlanta +Brave+ now (right)\nDisturbin' Tha Peace, I'll let the lead spray\nI'm startin to love this place, they even got Red Clay (okay)\nHit a different strip club e'ry day (yeah)\nAnd I don't make it rain, it's a hurricane on the way (ha ha ha)\nAnd I got the A-Town pump\nIt'll make your whole body do the A-Town stomp (woo!)\nThen it's off to the Waffle House\nAnd pancake mix ain't the only thing comin out her mouth\nAnd her 42 D's comin out her blouse\nHer baby daddy comin in (Game, get out the house, and)\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Ludacris]\nYeah, I'm in a real-life movie, so this is take three\nWhen Luda step foot out in Phoenix, A-Z\nSuperbowl super hoes, rappers on stroll\nSo I put the call in to Willy Northpole\n\n[Willy Northpole] + (Ludacris)\nWoo, big homie I got ya, stick to you like a cactus\nWelcome to the Bird City, Chris, take off your jacket\nI know you kinda used to big booties in the club\nBut ain't nothin wrong to have a lil' sauce in your blood\nI see a couple thugs with some bitch tendencies\nMy town, but I still got Phoenix enemies (yup)\nHaters wanna stop 'em and I really wanna pop 'em\nBut it's hard to fight back when you got an album droppin (connects)\nWe in South Phoenix, niggas Africa bang\nMatter fact, Chris, tuck in your Africa chain (what?)\nCause I see some niggas starin at us with a lame frown\nI'mma call up the homies (it's about to go DOWN)\n\n[Hook/Outro: Ludacris] + (Willy Northpole)"}}, {"title": "Game Got Switched", "album": "Incognegro", "year": "2000-05-16", "lyrics": "[Chorus]\nI hate it when it's too many niggas, not enough hoes\nToo many

on some Ludacris shit\nSo all y'all can suck my dick, bitch\n\n[Verse 1]\nI got a whip like Miracle Ludacris lyrical fool\nWe dirty south shut yo' mouth we rock jewels\nNo holds barred but obey the block rules\nCock tools put chlorine in record pools\nAre there anyone like ya (hell naw)\nI treat humans like students (fail y'all)\nSo turn ya books to page 69 and start suckin'\nWhen Organized drop the tracks then start duckin'\nWhen Ludacris get in the bed, start fuckin;\n(You wanna be startin' some'n) Get out the booth\nAnd lemme tell y'all the truth, we kick down do's\nSave all the H20 for front rows\nLive in the bank and watch for stank hoes\nStay chromed out and that's on or off road\nIf you know what I mean, proceed to stay clean\nLight skinned nigga turn red but get green\nInhale some of that 'dro but blow steam\nLove a combination, big ass and tight jeans\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause it's too many niggas, not enough hoes\nToo many rookies, not enough pros\nThe game got switched on

still be half broke\nAshes to ashes, smoke or get smoked\nWe come by the masses, you come and get choked\nIf you take me for a fool, I'll take you for a joke\nTired of fast food so they cooked up dope\nSo now we eatin' lobster, shrimp and things\nAnd watch for imposters that's been in the game\nWe invented the game and y'all just got hip\n(Man, what's that smell) Probably your upper lip\n'Cause I love to walk around like my shit don't stank\nEven if it's cigars and that purple color dank\nChillin' in the gump with no trace of Tom Hanks\nSo put this in yo' jaw like weiners and beef franks\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause it's too many niggas, not enough hoes\nToo many rookies, not enough pros\nThe game got switched on some Ludacris shit\nSo all y'all can suck my dick, bitch\nToo many niggas, not enough hoes\nToo many rookies, not enough pros\nThe game got switched on some Ludacris shit\nSo all y'all can suck my dick, bitch\n\n[Verse 3]\nI put too much sugar in my Kool-Aid\nAnd party like a kid with a high top fade\nArrive to a show and I like to get paid\nArrive to a hoe and I like to get laid\nRide up on my back like rugs and floormats\nI'm on the right page but what's my format?\nI wave to the ocean 'cause I'm where shores at\nAnd women go nuts just like my bozack\nDid you know that? Man, I'm the gift of change\nElectric stoves so give me the keys to the Range\nShagadelic, beautiful but strange\nWent to Magic City saw Nikki and Blue Flames\nRearrange, same broad different night\nPass the E&J and let a nigga get right\nThe bomb threaten dude that's on yo same flight\nThe highlight's that I live a high ass life\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause it's too many niggas, not enough hoes\nToo many rookies, not enough pros\nThe game got switched on some Ludacris shit\nSo all y'all can suck my dick, bitch\nToo many niggas, not enough hoes\nToo many rookies, not enough pros\nThe

many niggas, not enough hoes\nToo many rookies, not enough pros\nThe game got switched on some Ludacris shit\nSo all y'all can suck my dick, bitch\n\n[Verse 1]\nI got a whip like Miracle Ludacris lyrical fool\nWe dirty south shut yo' mouth we rock jewels\nNo holds barred but obey the block rules\nCock tools put chlorine in record pools\nAre there anyone like ya (hell naw)\nI treat humans like students (fail y'all)\nSo turn ya books to page 69 and start suckin'\nWhen Organized drop the tracks then start duckin'\nWhen Ludacris get in the bed, start fuckin;\n(You wanna be startin' some'n) Get out the booth\nAnd lemme tell y'all the truth, we kick down do's\nSave all the H20 for front rows\nLive in the bank and watch for stank hoes\nStay chromed out and that's on or off road\nIf you know what I mean, proceed to stay clean\nLight skinned nigga turn red but get green\nInhale some of that 'dro but blow steam\nLove a combination, big ass and tight jeans\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause it's too many niggas, not enough hoes\nToo many rookies, not enough pros\nThe game got switched on some Ludacris shit\nSo all y'all can suck my dick, bitch\nToo many niggas, not enough hoes\nToo many rookies, not enough pros\nThe game got switched on some Ludacris shit\nSo all y'all can suck my dick, bitch\n\n[Verse 2]\n(Boy, you done lost yo' mind) No, I've lost my virginity\nAnd I shot click like that fool shot Kennedy\nWhat's the remedy Hennessey Coke\nIf you cut all your money you'd still be half broke\nAshes to ashes, smoke or get smoked\nWe come by the masses, you come and get choked\nIf you take me for a fool, I'll take you for a joke\nTired of fast food so they cooked up dope\nSo now we eatin' lobster, shrimp and things\nAnd watch for imposters that's been in the game\nWe invented the game and y'all just got hip\n(Man, what's that smell) Probably your upper lip\n'Cause I love to walk around like my shit don't stank\nEven if it's cigars and that purple color dank\nChillin' in the gump with no trace of Tom Hanks\nSo put this in yo' jaw like weiners and beef franks\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause it's too many niggas, not enough hoes\nToo many rookies, not enough pros\nThe game got switched on some Ludacris shit\nSo all y'all can suck my dick, bitch\nToo many niggas, not enough hoes\nToo many rookies, not enough pros\nThe game got switched on some Ludacris shit\nSo all y'all can suck my dick, bitch\n\n[Verse 3]\nI put too much sugar in my Kool-Aid\nAnd party like a kid with a high top fade\nArrive to a show and I like to get paid\nArrive to a hoe and I like to get laid\nRide up on my back like rugs and floormats\nI'm on the right page but what's my format?\nI wave to the ocean 'cause I'm where shores at\nAnd women go nuts just like my bozack\nDid you know that? Man, I'm the gift of change\nElectric stoves so give me the keys to the Range\nShagadelic, beautiful but strange\nWent to Magic City saw Nikki and Blue Flames\nRearrange, same broad different night\nPass the E&J and let a nigga get right\nThe bomb threaten dude that's on yo same flight\nThe highlight's that I live a high ass life\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause it's too many niggas, not enough hoes\nToo many rookies, not enough pros\nThe game got switched on some Ludacris shit\nSo all y'all can suck my dick, bitch\nToo many niggas, not enough hoes\nToo many rookies, not enough pros\nThe game got switched on some Ludacris shit\nSo all y'all can suck my dick, bitch\n'Cause it's too many niggas, not enough hoes\nToo many rookies, not enough pros\nThe game got switched on some Ludacris shit\nSo all y'all can suck my dick, bitch\nToo many niggas, not enough hoes\nToo many rookies, not enough pros\nThe game got switched on some Ludacris shit\nSo all y'all can suck my dick, bitch"}}, {"title": "Screwed Up", "album": "Chicken-n-Beer", "year": "2003-10-07", "lyrics": "(*Man coughs*)\n(*Man talking*)\nAh yeah, we sending this one out\nFrom everybody I mean to everybody from the H-Town to the A-Town to worldwide\nSo get your lighters, get your drink\nAnd I tell you what I'm so fucked up, and screwed up\nIf anybody try to blow my high, you know what I'mma tell 'em\n\n(Chorus)\n[Man] Ludacris\n[Fuck you!] Fuck you!\n[Fuck you!] Fuck you!\n[Fuck you!] Fuck you!\n[Fuck you!] Fuck you!\n[I'm screwed up]\n\n[Ludacris]\nI feel better than I've ever felt before, Ah!\nIntoxicated but maintaining self-control, Ah!\nI took a swig, I had a jug, chug-a-log, I'm loud and clear\nI had some bud, I lit it up, and then I made it disappear\nCause my magic tricks, are so fabulous\nThis shit's hazardous, got amateurs smoking canibus\nIf you mad at this, damn it then\n\n(Chorus)\n\n[Lil' Flip]\nI made a, call to my dog, time to split the blunt and break it up\nThree-wheel motion, purple potion, I gotta shake it up\nI tried to kick the habit, but it keep calling me\nAbracadabra, here's a magic trick, I smoked up all the weed\nZig-Zag's and golden wraps got my mind gone\nDrugs don't affect my work, I still get my grind on\n\n(Chorus)\n\n[Ludacris]\nI'm leaning like the Tower of Pisa, the syrup squeezer\nCome close to my stash, and get treated as if I'm Ebeneezer\nI'm throwed, blowed, matter-of-fact let's call this the thrower potion\nI'm screwed up, so no wonder things are in slower motion\nI gots to have it,can't kick the habit, I've tried to shake it\nThe drug experiment stage if you mistake then\n\n(Chorus)\n\n[Lil' Flip]\nI'm from Screwed Up Texas, we drive reckless, and then we peel off\nYou ain't had shit until you smoke Sweet Tooth and Jack Frost\nHit it twice but don't cough, you gotta take it man\nIf it's a record for smoking I'm 'bout to break it man\nMe and Luda puffing budda, we in a black Cougar\nOn Zap Judas, you try to jack us we grab rugers\n\n(Chorus)\n\n[Ludacris]\nHow can I say it plain?\nThat I'm off that Mary Jane\nAnd if it's true what they say\nThen I don't know how many cells is left in my fucking brain\nBut I'mma keep on writing and lighting\nMinds of these hungry rappers\nAnd tell the hood that I've hired niggas and fired crackers\nOn the Fourth of July, opens your eyes I'm joking stupid\nI love all races but if you hating my music then\n\n(Chorus)\n\n[Lil' Flip]\nI love my\nI get patient we never have to take a piss test\nFuck a 9 to 5 cause I'm always getting rest\nI wake to breakfest and head\nYou wake up to breakfast in bed\nShould I drive my H2?

"[Hook 2X: Nate Dogg]\nIt's gonna get in ya, child of the night\n(baby I got) and the hood rolls on\nHow do I begin to, do this shit right\n(baby I got) get my hustle on\n\n[Verse 1: Ludacris]\nLook here!\nNow I'm a man of many talents and a man of my word\nBut on my path to see the light sometimes my vision gets blurred\nIt's all a part of growin up and seein life at it's worst\nThen tryin to iron out my wrinkles, puttin family first\nIt seems like the whole world is out for sinkin my boat\nBut with God as my navigator I'll be stayin afloat\nAnd I admit to bein caught by many foolish distractions\nThen I'm forced to pay the price as the result of my actions\nI'm battlin with MYSELF and every DAY it's a war\nCuriosity killed the cat, why I'm Curious George?\nGotta keep my nose up outta thangs that ain't none of my biz\nAnd just cause somethin looks good don't really mean that it is\nGet through the agony and anger, the pain and strife\nAnd take the necessary steps to try to change my life\nI got some questions for you Lord cause my mentality's hood\nSo why is everything that's bad for me feel so good?\n\n[Hook: Nate Dogg]\nIt's gonna get in ya, child of the night\n(baby I got) and the hood rolls on\nHow do I begin to, do this shit right\n(baby I got) get my hustle on\nIt's gonna get in ya, child of the night\n(baby I got) and the hood rolls on\nHow do I begin to, do this shit right\n(baby I got) get my hustle on\n\n[Verse 2: Ludacris]\nNow I'm a only child, so excuse some of my selfish ways\nI got spoiled when I was young, spoil myself today\nOh but I feed at least a thousand stomachs and how I've done it\nIs from the ground up a hundred miles and runnin\nDodgin and duckin everybody tryin to hammer me down\nA self-made millionaire, baby look at me now\nCan't tell me nothin still hungry as the day I began\nCause all I ever really needed was a pen in my hand\nAnd a, pad in my lap, didn't matter in fact\nMe and my momma lived in one room, and what's badder than that\nWas a young man forced to grow up at the age of 12\nTryin to get in where I fit, streets givin me hell\nBut yet I give it right - back, so how you like - that\nContinue doin wrong 'til I was on the right - track\nTell me 'bout heavy money I might give it a PUSH\nBut a, bird in the hand is worth two in the bush\nCome on\n\n[Hook: Nate Dogg]\nIt's gonna get in ya, child of the night\n(baby I got) and the hood rolls on\nHow do I begin to, do this shit right\n(baby I got) get my hustle on\nIt's gonna get in ya, child of the night\n(baby I got) and the hood rolls on\nHow do I begin to, do this shit right\n(baby I got) get my hustle on\n\n[Interlude: Ludacris]\nNo matter how much older we get man, we all still children at heart\nWe all make mistakes, it's all good\n\n[Verse 3: Ludacris]\nNow I've tried plenty of times to get rid of my bad habits\nLivin life on the cuttin edge, takin a stab at it\nAnd learnin from my mistakes, try not to make 'em twice\nJust admittin when I'm wrong, tryin hard to make it right\nAnd baby, nobody's perfect in this world of ours\nThere's plenty people gettin stitches in this world of scars\nBut over time, pray to God that he can heal your wounds\nTry to love and love again until they seal your tomb\nCause life is short if you don't know this it'll pass you by\nThat's why my head is in the clouds tryin to pass the sky\nNever blinkin for a minute, keep my eyes on my foes\nThey wanna catch me in the open, bring my life to a close\nMeanwhile that's why I'm bringin so much life to my shows\nI've seen smiles I'm makin changes turnin glitter to gold\nDon't let these devils play you down or belittle your soul\nJust be happy with yo'self and it's so simple to grow\nCome on\n\n[Hook to fade with adlibs: Nate Dogg]\nIt's gonna get in ya, child of the night\n(baby I got) and the hood rolls on\nHow do I begin to, do this shit right\n(baby I got) get my hustle on"}}, {"title": "U Got a Problem?", "album":

The song glorifies mass murder and drug use, and none of the rappers (of which there are many) feel anything close to remorse about their heinous actions.  Curse words are used as punctuation, and all four rappers are depicted shooting people (including children at school), decapitating people, crushing people\u2019s heads and dealing drugs.  Children who know Ludacris from his performances in films such as the Fast & Furious series or for rapping in Justin Bieber\u2019s \u201cBaby\u201d and look up to him as a role model will be

DTP in this muthafucka!\nAnd for all y'all that don't like it, do one thang, get the fuck back!\nCause all my niggas iz ready\nLuda, 20, Fate, Shawnna\nLet's show these muthafuckas how we disturb the peace\nGet the fuck back, bitch!\n(shooting and screaming in the background)\n\n[Chorus: Ludacris]\nFuck That!\nGet the fuck back!\nLuda make your skull crack\nTuck that\nBitch, your whole town's on my nutsack\nCuff that\nPut it in your weed, nigga, puff that\nWhat's that\nPeople gon' die tonight\n\n[Chorus: I-20]\nFuck That!\nGet the fuck back!\nD-low make your skull crack\nTuck that\nBitch, your whole town's on my nutsack\nCuff that\nPut it in your weed, nigga, puff that\nWhat's that\nPeople gon' die tonight\n\n[Verse 1: I-20]\nBronson, muthafucka, give me more than three feet\nDTP in the club, we comin' more than three deep\nYour whole crew is weak and my squad is real cash getters\nStayin' more to crunk, our shit bump like bad clippers\nHow many try to hustle with Dealer then went broke\nInfamous, I'm a value meal, I come with the coke\nI gotta enough guns for beef, if you want it that way\nI'll push your wig back like finger weaves or bad toupee\n\n[Verse 2: Ludacris]\nI lick a load of you niggas, leave kids in the hallways\nCatch 'em at they locka (hoo-ahh, blocka blocka)(gun shots)\nSee 'em on Broadway and tap they ass\nCatch 'em in the swimming pool and overlap they ass\n\n[Verse 3: Fate Wilson]\nI'm from the southside, College Park\nG Road, niggas gone\nRide when the beef starts\nDon't hold back, let the heat spark\nOne's through his vest, bust through his chest\nSleepy hollows lay the niggas to rest, uh\n\n[Chorus: Ludacris]\nFuck That!\nGet the fuck back!\nLuda make your skull crack\nTuck that\nBitch, your whole town's on my nutsack\nCuff that\nPut it in your weed, nigga, puff that\nWhat's that\nPeople gon' die tonight\n\n[Chorus: Shawna]\nFuck That!\nGet the fuck back!\nShawnna make your skull crack\nTuck that\nBitch, your whole town better love dat\nCuff that\nPut it in your weed, nigga, puff that\nWhat's that\nPeople gon' die tonight\n\n[Verse 4: Shawna]\nWhat you know about projects, hoes, and murda\nWhole lotta game, whole lotta keys and burners\nWhole lotta dope fiends, trying to scheme the workers\nWhole lotta feds, got them niggas scared to surface\nType of bitch that got the brown in my sock\nFind me on tha block tryin' to cop a piece of the crop\nWatch me, pull up on me real sweet in a drop\nBut if you fuckin' with my paper, feel the heat from the Glock, nigga\n\n[Verse 5: Ludacris]\nWe pop bottles, bottles, right over you head, niggas\nPut nozzles, nozzles, right over your leg, niggas\nOur motto, motto, is kill 'em instead, niggas\nWe make 'em loose weight, when we Jenny Craig, niggas\n\n[Verse 6: I-20]\nAll of ya'll is half nice, half thugs, and half assed\nThe only time Im goin' half, is half on a half\nBut I use a full clip, cuz I'm a full fledged killa\nPart-time MC, full-time drug dealer\n\n[Chorus: Ludacris]\nFuck That!\nGet the fuck back!\nLuda make your skull crack\nTuck that\nBitch, your whole town's on my nutsack\nCuff that\nPut it in your weed, nigga, puff that\nWhat's that\nPeople gon' die

talkin' shit on mixed tapes\nIll catch you at a show and beat you with a mixtape\nYou best pump brakes, 'fore I pump shells and blood oze\nI leave niggas like burps (burp), excuse\nJust keep on pissin' me off, like a weak kidney\nAnd you will find your family reading your obituary\n\n[Verse 8: Ludacris]\nThese people tryin' to scrub the red off\nStains they don't get off\nThey wanted to bring the pain, so this thang 'bout to set off\nBarretas for getting cheddar, you're better off dead off\nYes, you can do it, cut his fuckin' head off\n\n[Verse 9: Shawna]\nI got a letter from the government, the other day\nThey told me that the bitches caught a shipment of my yay\nThey on their way, three minutes to get the k\nTwo minutes to get the weight, one minute and I'mma spray\n\n[Chorus: Ludacris]\nFuck That!\nGet the fuck back!\nWe make your skull crack\nTuck that\nBitch, your whole town's on my nutsack\nCuff that\nPut it in your weed, nigga, puff that\nWhat's that\nPeople gon' die tonight\n\n[Chorus: Shawna]\nFuck That!\nGet the fuck back!\nWe make your skull crack\nTuck that\nBitch, your whole town better luh dat\nCuff that\nPut it in your weed, nigga,

gotta remind you motherfuckers who I am\nYou know what they call me, Luda\nHave some more fun with these niggas, man\nLet's go\n\nYeah, in Atlanta, been that hot nigga\nOn my second term like Barack, nigga\nLyrical abuse when I'm in the booth\nTreat them like the NFL, how I drop niggas\nI put 'em on the exempt list\nTake 'em off the track\nIf they ain't earned it, that's pimp shit\nMulti-colored bracelets on my wrist, no friendships\nYeah, I have relations with your bitch, no kinship\nLuda, back at it like a better me\nI'm just try'na earn my stripes like a referee\nCall a foul on the play, you's a ho-nigga\nSellin' records, you can't even sell an O, nigga\nAnd I'm smokin' on that knockout\nNew school niggas missin' credits like they dropped out\nAnd I'm just takin' pictures 'til these bitches all cropped out\nAnd only trace left is their bodies bein' chalked out\nThen it's time to bring the drops out\nWoman face down, you can say I'm gettin' topped out\nDef Jam, should I opt out?\nTwo albums left, Flavor Flav, time to clock out\nFight the power"}}, {"title": "Not Long", "album": "Ludaversal", "year": "2015-03-31", "lyrics": "[Hook: Usher]\nIf you look to the stars, you'll find that your not far from them\nAnd if you follow your heart, you'll find that you'll be one of them\nAnd not long\nAnd not long\nAnd not long\nAnd not long\nAnd not long\n\n[Verse 1: Ludacris]\nLong days half sober nights\nUnsigned performing at every open mic\nGod is all I needed to believe in me\nHaters I tuned them out they were on another frequency\nMy momma never winded my decision\nAnd all the bright lights never blinded out my vision\nMusic was my passion and my first crush\nI'm just tryna ride the waves baby surfs up\nWhen I'm down music gets me worked up\nPlus in all my shows it gets women to pull they skirts up\nWhat can I say I'm turnt up\nI'm on fire these other rappers is burnt up\n\n[Hook: Usher]\nIf you look to the stars, you'll find that your not far from them\nAnd if you follow your heart, you'll find that you'll be one of them\nAnd not long\nAnd not long\nAnd not long\nAnd not long\nAnd not long\n\n[Verse 2: Ludacris]\nYeah what an imagination\nI'm a dreamer losing my concentration\nHead in the clouds to trace my observations\nJust connect the dots to all of the constellations\nLooking for signs that's astrological\nAnd I don't dream big my dreams are astronomical\nSo when critics write articles of my chronicles\nI wonder if my hunger is felt in they abdominals\nHiding from life daily distractions\nWhere thoughts become things from the power of attraction\nAnd I'm attracted to money and beautiful women\nHa and toasting to new beginnings, yeah\n\n[Hook: Usher]\nIf you look to the stars, you'll find that your not far from them\nAnd if you follow your heart, you'll find that you'll be one of them\nAnd not long\nAnd not long\nAnd not long\nAnd not long\nAnd not long\n\n[Verse 3: Ludacris]\nLook its not long til the fights over\nThe turbulence is non stop till the flights over\nSo when passengers panic just stay silent\nAnd realize its never too late to become the pilot\nI fly higher take control of my destiny\nThe first step I needed me to invest in me\nIts still an every day struggle for wealth\nI'd rather struggle to working for me than working for someone else\nAnd I'm steady tryna ease the stress\nSo I open up all the doors with the key to success\nIf it hasn't been done then I'mma do it first\nCuz I'm the master of the Ludaverse\n\n[Hook: Usher]\nIf you look to the stars, you'll find that your not far from them\nAnd if you follow your heart, you'll find that you'll be one of them\nAnd not long\nAnd not long\nAnd not long\nAnd not long\nAnd not long", "image":

follow your heart, you'll find that you'll be one of them\nAnd not long\nAnd not long\nAnd not long\nAnd not long\nAnd not long\n\n[Verse 1: Ludacris]\nLong days half sober nights\nUnsigned performing at every open mic\nGod is all I needed to believe in me\nHaters I tuned them out they were on another frequency\nMy momma never winded my decision\nAnd all the bright lights never blinded out my vision\nMusic was my passion and my first crush\nI'm just tryna ride the waves baby surfs up\nWhen I'm down music gets me worked up\nPlus in all my shows it gets women to pull they skirts up\nWhat can I say I'm turnt up\nI'm on fire these other rappers is burnt up\n\n[Hook: Usher]\nIf you look to the stars, you'll find that your not far from them\nAnd if you follow your heart, you'll find that you'll be one of them\nAnd not long\nAnd not long\nAnd not long\nAnd not long\nAnd not long\n\n[Verse 2: Ludacris]\nYeah what an imagination\nI'm a dreamer losing my concentration\nHead in the clouds to trace my observations\nJust connect the dots to all of the constellations\nLooking for signs that's astrological\nAnd I don't dream big my dreams are astronomical\nSo when critics write articles of my chronicles\nI wonder if my hunger is felt in they abdominals\nHiding from life daily distractions\nWhere thoughts become things from the power of attraction\nAnd I'm attracted to money and beautiful women\nHa and toasting to new beginnings, yeah\n\n[Hook: Usher]\nIf you look to the stars, you'll find that your not far from them\nAnd if you follow your heart, you'll find that you'll be one of them\nAnd not long\nAnd not long\nAnd not long\nAnd not long\nAnd not long\n\n[Verse 3: Ludacris]\nLook its not long til the fights over\nThe turbulence is non stop till the flights over\nSo when passengers panic just stay silent\nAnd realize its never too late to become the pilot\nI fly higher take control of my destiny\nThe first step I needed me to invest in me\nIts still an every day struggle for wealth\nI'd rather struggle to working for me than working for someone else\nAnd I'm steady tryna ease the stress\nSo I open up all the doors with the key to success\nIf it hasn't been done then I'mma do it first\nCuz I'm the master of the Ludaverse\n\n[Hook: Usher]\nIf you look to the stars, you'll find that your not far from them\nAnd if you follow your heart, you'll find that you'll be one of them\nAnd not long\nAnd not long\nAnd not long\nAnd not long\nAnd not long"}}, {"title": "Charge It to the Rap Game", "album": "Ludaversal", "year": "2015-03-31", "lyrics":

the industry shady not everybody is your friend\nI had to learn that shit the hard way\nIn and out bogus contracts since before i was rapping in the hallway\nEveryone out for money, executives out for

nigga\n\n[Hook]\nEverybody wants the fortune and fame\nThe more things change , the more they stay the same\nThis industry is like a crack game\nSometimes you gotta charge it to the rap game\nSometimes you gotta charge it to the rap game\nSometimes you gotta charge it to the rap game\nThis industry is like a crap game\nSometimes you gotta charge it to the rap game"}}], "artist":
