"[Intro]\nYo Iz, let's do this\n\n[Verse 1: Ice-T]\nI am a nightmare walkin', psychopath talkin'\nKing of my jungle, just a gangster stalkin'\nLivin' life like a firecracker, quick is my fuse\nVendettas of death back; the colors I choose\nRed or Blue, Cuz or Blood, it just don't matter\nSucka dive for your life when my shotgun scatters\nThe gangs of L.A. will never die - just multiply\n\n[Interlude: Ice-T]\nYou see they hit us then we hit them\nThen we hit them and they hit us, man\nIt's like a war, ya know what I'm sayin'\nPeople don't even understand\nThey don't even know what they dealing with\nYou wanna get rid of the gangs it's gonna take a lotta work\nBut people don't understand the size of this\nThis is no joke man, this is real\n\n[Verse 2: Ice-T]\nYou don't know me, fool\nYou disown me, cool\nI don't need your assistance, social persistence\nAny problem I got I just put my fist in\nMy life is violent but violent is life\nPeace is a dream, reality is a knife\nMy colors, my honor, my colors, my all\nWith my colors upon me one soldier stands tall\nTell me what have you left me, what have I got?\nLast night in cold blood my young brother got shot\nMy homeboy got jacked\nMy mother's on crack\nMy sister can't work cause her arms show tracks\nMadness insanity, live in profanity\nThen some punk claimin' they're understandin' me\nGive me a break, what world do you live in\nDeath is my set, guess my religion\n\n[Interlude: Ice-T]\nYo my brother was a gang banger\nAnd all my homeboys bang\nI don't know why I do it man, I just do it\nI never had much of nothing man\nLook at you man, you've got everything going for yourself\nAnd I ain't got nothing man, I've got nothing\nI'm living in the ghetto man\nJust look at me man, look at me\n\n[Verse 3: Ice-T]\nMy pants are saggin', braided hair\nSuckas stare but I don't care\nMy game ain't knowledge, my game's fear\nI've no remorse so squares beware\nBut my true mission is just revenge\nYou ain't in my set, you ain't my friend\nWear the wrong color your life could end\nHomicide's my favorite binge\n\n[Interlude: Ice-T]\nListen to me man\nNo matter whatcha do don't ever join a gang\nYou don't wanna be in it man\nYou're just gonna end up in a mix of dead friends and time in jail I\nKnow, if\nI had a chance like you\nI would never be in a gang man\nBut I didn't have a chance\nYou know I wish I did\n\n[Verse 4: Ice-T]\nI'll just walk like a giant, police defiant\nYou'll say to stop but I'll say that I can't\nMy gang's my family, it's all that I have\nI'm a star, on the walls is my autograph\nYou don't like it, so you know where you can go\nCause the streets are my stage and terror's my show\nPsycho-analyze tried diagnosin' me, why?\nIt wasn't your brother that brutally died\nBut it was mine, so let me define\nMy territory; don't cross the line\nDon't try to act crazy cause that shit don't faze me\nIf you ran like a punk, it wouldn't amaze me\nCause my colors death\nThough we all want peace\nBut our war won't end\n'Till all wars cease\n\n[Interlude: Ice-T]\nSee the wars of the street gangs will always get to me, man\nBut I don't wanna be down with this situationm man\nBut I'm in here, if I had something better to do I think I'd do it But right now, I'm just down here boy\nI'm trying to get money cause I'm smart\nI'm gonna get paid while I'm out here\nI'm gonna get that paper, ya know what I'm saying\nIf I had a chance like you\nMaybe I would be in school\nBut I'm not, I'm out here living day to day surviving\nAnd I'm willing to die for my colors\n\n[Outro]\nYo, please stop cause I want y'all to live\nThis is Ice-T, peace"}}, {"title": "6 'N the Mornin'", "album": "Rhyme Pays", "year": "1986-01-01", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\n6 in the morning, police at my door\nFresh Adidas squeak across the bathroom floor\nOut my back window I make my escape\nDon't even get a chance to grab my old school tape\nMad with no music, but happy cause free\nAnd the streets to a player is the place to be\nGot a knot in my pocket, weighing at least a grand\nGold on my neck, my pistols close at hand\nI'm a self-made monster of the city streets\nRemotely controlled by hard hip-hop beats\nBut just living in the city is a serious task\nDidn't know what the cops wanted, didn't have time to ask\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nSeen my homeboys cooling way way out\nTold 'em bout my morning cold bugged' em out\nShot a little dice til my knees got sore\nKicked around some stories bout the night before\nPosse to the corner where the fly girls chill\nThrew action at some freaks until one bitch got ill\nShe started acting silly simply would not quit\nCalled us all punk pussies, said we all weren't shit\nAs we walked over to her, ho continued to speak\nSo we beat the bitch down in the goddamn street\nBut just living in the city is a serious task\nBitch didn't know what hit her, didn't have time to ask\n\n[Hook]\n-Word-\n\n[Verse 3]\nContinued clocking freaks with immense posterior\nRolling in a Blazer with a louie interior\nSolid gold the ride was raw, bust a left turn was on Crenshaw\nSean-e-sean was the driver, known to give freaks hell\nHad a beeper goin' off like a high school bell\nLooked in the mirror, what did we see?\nFucking blue lights: L.A.P.D\nPigs searched our car, their day was made\nFound an Uzi, .44 and a hand grenade\nThrew us in the county high power block, no freaks to see no beats to rock\nDidn't want trouble but the shit must fly, squabbled this sucker shanked em in the eye\nBut just living in the county is a serious task\nNigga didn't know what happened, didn't have time to ask\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 4]\nBack on the streets after five and a deuce\nSeven years later but still had the juice\nMy homeboy Ken Gee put me up the track\nTold me E's rolling Villain, BJ's got the sack\nBruce is a giant - Nat C's clocking dough\nBe bop's a pimp, my old freaks a ho\nThe batter rams rolling, rocks are the thing\nLife has no meaning and money is king\nThen he looked at me slowly and Hen had to grin\nHe said, man you out early, we thought you got ten\nOpened his safe kicked me down with cold cash\nKnew I would get busy, he didn't waste time to ask\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 5]\nI bought a Benz with the money the rest went to clothes\nWent to the strip started pimping the hoes\nMy hair had grew long on my seven year stay\nAnd when I got it done on my shoulders it lay\nHard from the joint but fly to my heart\nI didn't want trouble but the shit had to start\nOut with my crew, some punks got loud\nShot gun blasts echoed through the crowd\nSix punks hit, two punks died\nAll causalities was applied to their side\nHuman lives has to pass just for talking much trash\nWe didn't know who they were, no one had the time to ask\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 6]\nSwat team leader yelled, hit the floor\nReached in my pocket pulled my .44\nDove across the room peeped out the window\nTwenty cops jumped behind a Pinto\nOut the back door like some damn track stars\nBroke down an alley jumped into a car\nSuckers didn't even see us, they musta been blind\nBlack wire touched red the car was mine\nWe hadn't done nothing but some suckers got shot\nHit the first turn, goddamn road block\nBroke through the block and we did it fast\nCops wouldn't shot us on sight, they wouldn't took time to ask\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 7]\nThe rollers gave chase at a serious speed, one more conviction was all I need\nThis shit was for real, it was no La-Di-Da-Di\nCause the boys had to pin the shit on somebody\nAnd me and my crew, we were known to get ill\nWe carried heat for protection but not to kill\nWe bust a corner doing 60, one police car spun\nAnd all I was thinking was, murder one\nBust a move into an alley and did it right\nAnd me and my crew, we're gone into the night\nBroke to my old lady's who drew me a bath\nShe didn't even know what happened, didn't care, didn't ask\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 8]\nWe made love like crazy on top of the sheets\nThis girlie was my worlie, a natural freak\nShe ran her tongue over each and every part of me\nThen she rocked my Amadeus while I watched TV\nA technician with a mission that's what she was\nIf there had been a crowd she would of got an applause\nThis girl did everything on Earth to me that could be done\nThe she backed off and teased me so I couldn't cum\nThen she cold got stupid pushed me on the floor\nHad me begging to stop as I was screaming for more\nAfter she waxed my body she let me crash\nShe knew her loving was def, she didn't waste time to ask\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 9]\nUp the next morning, feeling good as hell\nSleeping with a girlie sure beats a cell\nHit the boulevard in my A.M.G\nHo's catching whiplash, trying to glimpse the T\nRing on my mobile yes cellular\nGot to have a phone when I'm in my car\nWas my homeboy Red Some say he's insane\nBroke his bitch jaw for smoking 'caine\nTold me to meet him at the airport\nSaid he's jumping bail said he just left court\nCaught the first thing smoking in a serious dash\nDidn't know where we were going, didn't care, didn't ask\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 10]\nFell asleep on the plane and so did he, woke up chilling in N.Y.C\nCalled up my posse when I got there, hit the Latin Quarter and Union Square\nRooftop devil's nest the rest we passed, back doored the Palladium just for class\nAbout 4 a.m. we crashed the deuce, we never catch static cause my boys got juice\nDeuced it to the Bronx to rest our heads\nWhere a shoot-out jumped off, nine people lay dead\nIt sounded like it happened with a Mac-10 blast\nBut it was 6 in the morning, we didn't wake up to ask\n\n[Hook]", "image":

my back window I make my escape\nDon't even get a chance to grab my old school tape\nMad with no music, but happy cause free\nAnd the streets to a player is the place to be\nGot a knot in my pocket, weighing at least a grand\nGold on my neck, my pistols close at hand\nI'm a self-made monster of the city streets\nRemotely controlled by hard hip-hop beats\nBut just living in the city is a serious task\nDidn't know what the cops wanted, didn't have time to ask\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nSeen my homeboys cooling way way out\nTold 'em bout my morning cold bugged' em out\nShot a little dice til my knees got sore\nKicked around some stories bout the night before\nPosse to the corner where the fly girls chill\nThrew action at some freaks until one bitch got ill\nShe started acting silly simply would not quit\nCalled us all punk pussies, said we all weren't shit\nAs we walked over to her, ho continued to speak\nSo we beat the bitch down in the goddamn street\nBut just living in the city is a serious task\nBitch didn't know what hit her, didn't have time to ask\n\n[Hook]\n-Word-\n\n[Verse 3]\nContinued clocking freaks with immense posterior\nRolling in a Blazer with a louie interior\nSolid gold the ride was raw, bust a left turn was on Crenshaw\nSean-e-sean was the driver, known to give freaks hell\nHad a beeper goin' off like a high school bell\nLooked in the mirror, what did we see?\nFucking blue lights: L.A.P.D\nPigs searched our car, their day was made\nFound an Uzi, .44 and a hand grenade\nThrew us in the county high power block, no freaks to see no beats to rock\nDidn't want trouble but the shit must fly, squabbled this sucker shanked em in the eye\nBut just living in the county is a serious task\nNigga didn't know what happened, didn't have time to ask\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 4]\nBack on the streets after five and a deuce\nSeven years later but still had the juice\nMy homeboy Ken Gee put me up the track\nTold me E's rolling Villain, BJ's got the sack\nBruce is a giant - Nat C's clocking dough\nBe bop's a pimp, my old freaks a ho\nThe batter rams rolling, rocks are the thing\nLife has no meaning and money is king\nThen he looked at me slowly and Hen had to grin\nHe said, man you out early, we thought you got ten\nOpened his safe kicked me down with cold cash\nKnew I would get busy, he didn't waste time to ask\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 5]\nI bought a Benz with the money the rest went to clothes\nWent to the strip started pimping the hoes\nMy hair had grew long on my seven year stay\nAnd when I got it done on my shoulders it lay\nHard from the joint but fly to my heart\nI didn't want trouble but the shit had to start\nOut with my crew, some punks got loud\nShot gun blasts echoed through the crowd\nSix punks hit, two punks died\nAll causalities was applied to their side\nHuman lives has to pass just for talking much trash\nWe didn't know who they were, no one had the time to ask\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 6]\nSwat team leader yelled, hit the floor\nReached in my pocket pulled my .44\nDove across the room peeped out the window\nTwenty cops jumped behind a Pinto\nOut the back door like some damn track stars\nBroke down an alley jumped into a car\nSuckers didn't even see us, they musta been blind\nBlack wire touched red the car was mine\nWe hadn't done nothing but some suckers got shot\nHit the first turn, goddamn road block\nBroke through the block and we did it fast\nCops wouldn't shot us on sight, they wouldn't took time to ask\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 7]\nThe rollers gave chase at a serious speed, one more conviction was all I need\nThis shit was for real, it was no La-Di-Da-Di\nCause the boys had to pin the shit on somebody\nAnd me and my crew, we were known to get ill\nWe carried heat for protection but not to kill\nWe bust a corner doing 60, one police car spun\nAnd all I was thinking was, murder one\nBust a move into an alley and did it right\nAnd me and my crew, we're gone into the night\nBroke to my old lady's who drew me a bath\nShe didn't even know what happened, didn't care, didn't ask\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 8]\nWe made love like crazy on top of the sheets\nThis girlie was my worlie, a natural freak\nShe ran her tongue over each and every part of me\nThen she rocked my Amadeus while I watched TV\nA technician with a mission that's what she was\nIf there had been a crowd she would of got an applause\nThis girl did everything on Earth to me that could be done\nThe she backed off and teased me so I couldn't cum\nThen she cold got stupid pushed me on the floor\nHad me begging to stop as I was screaming for more\nAfter she waxed my body she let me crash\nShe knew her loving was def, she didn't waste time to ask\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 9]\nUp the next morning, feeling good as hell\nSleeping with a girlie sure beats a cell\nHit the boulevard in my A.M.G\nHo's catching whiplash, trying to glimpse the T\nRing on my mobile yes cellular\nGot to have a phone when I'm in my car\nWas my homeboy Red Some say he's insane\nBroke his bitch jaw for smoking 'caine\nTold me to meet him at the airport\nSaid he's jumping bail said he just left court\nCaught the first thing smoking in a serious dash\nDidn't know where we were going, didn't care, didn't ask\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 10]\nFell asleep on the plane and so did he, woke up chilling in N.Y.C\nCalled up my posse when I got there, hit the Latin Quarter and Union Square\nRooftop devil's nest the rest we passed, back doored the Palladium just for class\nAbout 4 a.m. we crashed the deuce, we never catch static cause my boys got juice\nDeuced it to the Bronx to rest our heads\nWhere a shoot-out jumped off, nine people lay dead\nIt sounded like it happened with a Mac-10 blast\nBut it was 6 in the morning, we didn't wake up to

hard\nI don't ask, the ICE just bogards\nSire Records puts me out, with Warner Bros. clout\nMy dope hits the streets with no doubt\nEvil E adds the cut, then removes it\nIZ checks for purity, then approves it\nAnd then you get it, try it and like it\nAnd if it ain't potent, we remix and spike it\nTo bring you the pure dope, not a noose in a rope\nBecause if you're doin' crack, you're on death row\nYou're just a toy punk, to mess with that junk\nYou want some real dope, come look in my trunk\nThe dope I'm sellin' is life, 100% legit\nSo get real fool, and try some real hit\n\n[Bridge]\nWord

get an LP\n\nLP, man? Have you went crazy man?\nI'm talking about some dope man\nI need to get high right now man\nWhy don't you hook me up with a 5-O?\n\nI can hook you up with a 12 inch\n\n12 inch? Man have you went crazy?\nYou don't even know what time it is\nOut here on the streets and don't know what time it is\nMan youse a fool\n\nYo homeboy you a fool\nYou don't know what time it is\nOut here, messing up your mind\nYou know what I'm sayin'?\nThis is Ice-T talkin' to you boy\nI'mma tell you what time it is\n\n[Verse 1]\nYo, it's time for me to pump the volume\nNo problem, the record's revolvin'\nEvil's the mixer, I'm the rap trixister\nPaparazzi on the bum rush for pictures\nIce, coolin', yo colder than ever\nPunk-Executioner E, pull the lever\nRotate the wax then cut an' axe the tracks\nPush up the levels till the red lights max\nDon't try to size up, you better wise up\nTo the rap criminals, we're succeeded\nDope beats and lyrics, no beepers needed\nFor this drug deal, I'm the big wheel\nThe dope I'm sellin', you don't smoke, you feel\nOut on the dance floor, on my world tour\nI'm sellin' dope in each and every record store\nI'm the kingpin when the wax spins\nCrack or smack will take you to a sure end\nYou don't need it, just throw that stuff away\nYou wanna get high? Let the record play\n\n[Bridge]\nAww man, I like this dope here man\nIt's feelin' alright boy\nWhat you say your name was man?\n\n[Hook]\nI'm your momma\nI'm your daddy\nI'm that nigga in the alley\nI'm your brother when you need\nA true player to emcee\nYou know me, a true friend\nYour main boy, thick and thin\nMC Ice-T\nI'm your pusher\n\n[Verse 2]\nI know you're lovin' this drug as it's comin' out your speaker\nBass thru the bottons, highs thru the tweeters\nBut this base you don't need a pipe\nJust a tempo to keep your hype\nGroovin' like I see you doin'\nSome stupid crack would just ruin\nYour natural high, why? .. That ain't fly\nAnd anyone who says it is, lies\nMove like I knew you would, like I knew could\nAnd if you ain't cracked out, then I know you should\nBe able to give me a clap, to match exact with the track\nAnd since I know that you ain't, I expect that\nOh now this jam is lit, it's like the ultimate\nPeople high off dope but still physically fit\nI'll make a million bucks, pack my dough in trucks\nFrom sellin' dope beats, dope rhymes, dope cuts\nI'll be the biggest dope dealer in history\nBecause all the fly will be high off that Ice-T\n\n[Bridge]\nAww man, you ain't ever lie man\nThis dope's alright man\nI gotta get back with you man\nLet me get your number man\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'll bring it to boil, Evil E rock it up\nYou want it? ... I don't think you got enough\nLast suckers crossed, Syndicate shot 'em up\nCops found 'em in the lake bottom up\nI don't play when it comes to my dope\nI check my lyrics close, like with a microscope\nI don't clean'em up with no Ivory soap\nI leave 'em hard and pure, hope that you can cope\nBecause you might O.D. if you overdrive\nThis record, tape or CD, because the sound I've\nCreated on this wax is like a chemical\nAnd the knowledge I give, makes me invincible\n\n[Bridge]\nAww Mr. Dopeman\nI'm lovin' you man\nYou got it goin' on man\nWhat else you got?\n\nI got some of that Kool Moe Dee\nAww yeah man, I want some of that\n\nGot some Doug E. Fresh\nAww yeah gimme an ounce of that\nI want that all night long\n\nI got some Eric B. & Rakim\nAww that is some real dope right there\n\nI got some LL Cool J\nNah, nah man, I don't want none of that\nYou can keep that man\n\nI got some Boogie Down Productions, KRS-One\nAww now you're talkin' man, come on\n\nPublic Enemy\nYeah don't stop, don't stop\n\nBiz Markie\nMakin' music with yo mouth Biz\nI love it\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 4]\nThe cops don't know what to do, because my dope breaks through\nNo matter what they do, my stuff gets to you\nKickin' on the Boulevard, my tempo's hyped and hard\nI don't ask, the ICE just bogards\nSire Records puts me out, with Warner Bros. clout\nMy dope hits the streets with no doubt\nEvil E adds the cut, then removes it\nIZ checks for purity, then approves it\nAnd then you get it, try it and like it\nAnd if it ain't potent, we remix and spike it\nTo bring you the pure dope, not a noose in a rope\nBecause if you're doin' crack, you're on death row\nYou're just a toy punk, to mess with that junk\nYou want some real dope, come look in my trunk\nThe dope I'm sellin' is life, 100% legit\nSo get real fool, and try some real hit\n\n[Bridge]\nWord up my brother\nYou got me high as a kite\nI feel good tonight\nIce-T, you alright\n\n[Hook]\n\nI'm your pusher"}}, {"title": "Girls L.G.B.N.A.F.", "album": "Power", "year": "1988-01-01", "lyrics":

butt\nGirls, let's get butt naked and fuck\n\n[Verse 4]\nI mean real stupid and nasty\nI know what you want, so you don't have to ask me\nJust lay back and I'll operate\nJimbrowski will go to work and

conversation, ain't talking 'bout nothing\nWhen all that's really on your mind is what?\n\"Yo baby, let's get butt naked and fuck\"\n\n[Verse 6]\nThat's right, if you're a man you want it\nIf you're a woman, you tease him and flaunt it\nBut my crew got to have it\nAnd after they dog it, I autograph it\nThe Syndicate don't lecture\nWe move in a group, seduce and capture\nAnd if the posse has good luck\nThe girls will get butt naked and fuck that night\n\n[Verse 7]\nIslam takes the pictures\nAnd girls, I'mma say Evil E's gonna get ya\nGet ya illing in a nude mode\nA double X-rated

is\nYa gotta be careful with this '88 sex biz\nBut that's another song\nGirls, move your bodies sexy and the brothers will come along\nHomeboys, move in on that butt and say\nGirls, let's get butt

creates the beats\nYou girls look so sexy\nI wish you all were up here with me\nYou drive me crazy with them big ole butts\nGirls, let's get butt naked and fuck\n\n[Verse 2]\nTonight, I'm trying to make this real clear, dear\nI've no time to whisper in your ear\nNo time to remove your fears\nI just wanna get near\nGet butt naked and roll around\nMove our bodies like up and down\nDo that stuff that your mama call smut\nGirls, let's get butt naked and fuck\n\n[Verse 3]\nCome on, you know you wanna do it too\nIt's good to me and it's good to you\nI only speak what's true\nYou say you don't, but I know you do\nCome on up to my room\nWe'll undress by the light of the moon\nLay down and I'll caress that butt\nGirls, let's get butt naked and fuck\n\n[Verse 4]\nI mean real stupid and nasty\nI know what you want, so you don't have to ask me\nJust lay back and I'll operate\nJimbrowski will go to work and penetrate\nAnd then we'll both feel great\nMake your move tonight, girl -- don't hesitate\nWe both want it, don't make it tough\nGirls, let's get butt naked and fuck\n\n[Verse 5]\nHomeboys, you know the situation\nYou're trying to rap but they give you frustration\nNose in the air, turning you down\nWhen you really wanna say, \"Yo baby, let's get down\"\nBut you don't, you keep fronting\nKicking conversation, ain't talking 'bout nothing\nWhen all that's really on your mind is what?\n\"Yo baby, let's get butt naked and fuck\"\n\n[Verse 6]\nThat's right, if you're a man you want it\nIf you're a woman, you tease him and flaunt it\nBut my crew got to have it\nAnd after they dog it, I autograph it\nThe Syndicate don't lecture\nWe move in a group, seduce and capture\nAnd if the posse has good luck\nThe girls will get butt naked and fuck that night\n\n[Verse 7]\nIslam takes the pictures\nAnd girls, I'mma say Evil E's gonna get ya\nGet ya illing in a nude mode\nA double X-rated episode\nHotel rooms cold explode when my posse unloads\nSex in effect when we're on the road\n\n[Verse 8]\nPut your hands up in the air\nIf you love sex -- I know you're out there\nSafe sex that is\nYa gotta be careful with this '88 sex biz\nBut that's another song\nGirls, move your bodies sexy and the brothers will come along\nHomeboys, move in on that butt and say\nGirls, let's get butt naked and fuck"}}, {"title": "New Jack Hustler", "album": "O.G. Original Gangster", "year": "1991-05-14", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nHustler, word, I pull the trigger long\nGrit my teeth, spray till every nigga's gone\nGot my block sewn, armored dope spots\nLast thing I sweat's a sucka punk cop\nMove like a king when I roll, hops\nYou try to flex, bang, another nigga drops\nYou gotta deal with this cause there's no way out\nWhy? Cash money ain't never gonna play out\nI got nothin to lose, much to gain\nIn my brain, I got a capitalist migraine\nI gotta get paid tonight, you muthafuckin right\nPickin' my grip, check my bitch, keep my game tight\nSo many hoes on my jock, think I'm a movie star\nNineteen, I got a fifty thousand dollar car\nGo to school, I ain't goin for it\nKiss my ass, bust the cap on the Moet\nCause I don't wanna hear that crap\nWhy? I'd rather be a New Jack... Hustler\n\n[Chorus]\nHustler\nHustler\nHustler\nH-U-S-T-L-E-R hustler\n\n[Interlude: Kid drop in]\nYo man you know what I'm sayin?\nYou got it goin on my man, I like how it's goin down\nYou got the fly cars, the girls, the jewels\nLook at that ring right there\nI know it's real, it's gotta be real\nMan, you the flyest nigga I seen in my life!\nYo man, I just wanna roll with you man\nHow can I be down?\n\n[Verse 2: Ice-T]\nWhat's up? You say you wanna be down?\nEase back, or motherfucker get beat down\nOut my face, fool I'm the illest\nBulletproof, I die harder than Bruce Willis\nGot my crew in effect, I bought em new Jags\nSo much cash, gotta keep it in Hefty bags\nAll I think about is keys and Gs\nImagine that, me workin at Mickey D's (ha ha ha ha)\nThat's a joke cause I'm never gonna be broke\nWhen I die there'll be bullets and gun smoke\nYa don't like my lifestyle? Fuck you!\nI'm rollin with the New Jack crew\nAnd I'm a hustler\n\n[Chorus]\nH-U-S-T-L-E-R hustler\nNew Jack, New Jack..........\n\n[Verse 3: Ice-T]\nHere I come, so you better break North\nAs I stride, my gold chains glide back and forth\nI care nothing 'bout you, and that's evident\nAll I love's my dope and dead presidents\nSound crazy? Well it isn't\nThe ends justifies the means, that's the system\nI learned that in school then I dropped out\nHit the streets, checked a grip, and now I got clout\nI had nothing, and I wanted it\nYou had everything, and you flaunted it\nTurned the needy into the greedy\nWith cocaine, my success came speedy\nGot me twisted, jammed into a paradox\nEvery dollar I get, another brother drops\nMaybe that's the plan, and I don't understand\nGod damn----you got me sinkin in quicksand\nBut since I don't know, and I ain't never learned\nI gotta get paid, I got money to earn\nWith my posse, out on the ave\nBump my sounds, crack a forty and laugh\nCool out and watch my new Benz gleam\nIs this a nightmare? Or the American dream?\nSo think twice if you're coming down my block\nYou wanna journey through hell? Well shit gets hot\nPregnant teens, children's screams\nLife is weighed on the scales of a triple beam\nYou don't come here much, and ya better not\nWrong move (bang), ambulance cot\nI gotta get more money than you got\nSo what, if some motherfucker gets shot?\nThat's how the game is played\nAnother brother slayed, the wound is deep\nBut they're givin us a band aid\nMy education's low but I got long dough\nI'm raised like a pit bull, my heart pumps nitro\nSleep on silk, lie like a politician\nMy Uzi's my best friend, cold as a mortician\nLock me up, it's genocidal catastrophe\nThere'll be another one after me!\nA hustler, hustler\n\n[Chorus]\nH-U-S-T-L-E-R hustler\nNew Jack, New Jack......", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8ba43671bb57813daf61c8431aebd0ea.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Ice-T", "raw": {"annotation_count": 26, "api_path": "/songs/23131", "apple_music_id": null, "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/23131/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "Samples\nflute loop, main hook \u2013 \u201cJasper Country Man,\u201d Bobbi Humphrey;\nascending horn loop (chorus) \u2013 \u201cBlues and Pants,\u201d James Brown"}, "embed_content": "<div id='rg_embed_link_23131' class='rg_embed_link' data-song-id='23131'>Read <a href='https://genius.com/Ice-t-new-jack-hustler-lyrics'>\u201cNew Jack Hustler\u201d by Ice-T</a> on Genius</div> <script crossorigin src='//genius.com/songs/23131/embed.js'></script>", "featured_video": false, "full_title": "New Jack Hustler by\u00a0Ice-T", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/8ba43671bb57813daf61c8431aebd0ea.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/8ba43671bb57813daf61c8431aebd0ea.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 23131, "lyrics_owner_id": 50, "lyrics_state": "complete", "path": "/Ice-t-new-jack-hustler-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 2, "recording_location": null, "release_date": "1991-05-14", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/8ba43671bb57813daf61c8431aebd0ea.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/8ba43671bb57813daf61c8431aebd0ea.1000x1000x1.jpg", "stats": {"accepted_annotations": 17, "contributors": 25, "hot": false, "iq_earners": 25, "transcribers": 0, "unreviewed_annotations": 8, "verified_annotations": 0, "pageviews": 6441}, "title": "New Jack Hustler", "title_with_featured": "New Jack Hustler", "url": "https://genius.com/Ice-t-new-jack-hustler-lyrics", "current_user_metadata": {"permissions": ["see_pageviews", "view_apple_music_player", "create_comment", "view_song_story_gallery"], "excluded_permissions": ["follow", "award_transcription_iq", "remove_transcription_iq", "pyong", "edit_lyrics", "view_annotation_engagement_data", "publish", "unpublish", "edit_spotify_details", "hide", "unhide", "toggle_featured_video", "add_pinned_annotation_to", "add_community_annotation_to", "destroy", "mark_as_not_spam", "edit_spotify_annotations_for", "verify_lyrics", "unverify_lyrics", "edit_anything", "edit_any_media", "edit", "rename", "edit_tags", "watch_fact_track", "reindex", "view_lyrics_synchronization", "enable_media", "disable_media", "edit_lyrics_or_annotation_brackets", "see_editorial_indicators", "view_attribution_visualization", "edit_annotation_brackets", "preview_lyrics_for_export", "hide_apple_player", "unhide_apple_player", "trigger_apple_match", "mark_lyrics_evaluation_as_approved", "mark_lyrics_evaluation_as_staff_approved", "mark_lyrics_evaluation_as_unapproved", "mark_lyrics_evaluation_as_un_staff_approved", "view_transcriber_media_player", "override_apple_match", "edit_youtube_url", "edit_soundcloud_url", "edit_spotify_uuid", "edit_vevo_url", "moderate_annotations", "create_annotation", "see_short_id", "manage_chart_item", "create_tag", "propose_lyrics_edit", "moderate_lyrics_edit_proposals"], "interactions": {"pyong": false, "following": false}, "relationships": {}, "iq_by_action": {}}, "album": {"api_path": "/albums/3759", "cover_art_url": "https://images.genius.com/8ba43671bb57813daf61c8431aebd0ea.1000x1000x1.jpg", "full_title": "O.G.

"[Verse 1]\nHustler, word, I pull the trigger long\nGrit my teeth, spray till every nigga's gone\nGot my block sewn, armored dope spots\nLast thing I sweat's a sucka punk cop\nMove like a king when I roll, hops\nYou try to flex, bang, another nigga drops\nYou gotta deal with this cause there's no way out\nWhy? Cash money ain't never gonna play out\nI got nothin to lose, much to gain\nIn my brain, I got a capitalist migraine\nI gotta get paid tonight, you muthafuckin right\nPickin' my grip, check my bitch, keep my game tight\nSo many hoes on my jock, think I'm a movie star\nNineteen, I got a fifty thousand dollar car\nGo to school, I ain't goin for it\nKiss my ass, bust the cap on the Moet\nCause I don't wanna hear that crap\nWhy? I'd rather be a New Jack... Hustler\n\n[Chorus]\nHustler\nHustler\nHustler\nH-U-S-T-L-E-R hustler\n\n[Interlude: Kid drop in]\nYo man you know what I'm sayin?\nYou got it goin on my man, I like how it's goin down\nYou got the fly cars, the girls, the jewels\nLook at that ring right there\nI know it's real, it's gotta be real\nMan, you the flyest nigga I seen in my life!\nYo man, I just wanna roll with you man\nHow can I be down?\n\n[Verse 2: Ice-T]\nWhat's up? You say you wanna be down?\nEase back, or motherfucker get beat down\nOut my face, fool I'm the illest\nBulletproof, I die harder than Bruce Willis\nGot my crew in effect, I bought em new Jags\nSo much cash, gotta keep it in Hefty bags\nAll I think about is keys and Gs\nImagine that, me workin at Mickey D's (ha ha ha ha)\nThat's a joke cause I'm never gonna be broke\nWhen I die there'll be bullets and gun smoke\nYa don't like my lifestyle? Fuck you!\nI'm rollin with the New Jack crew\nAnd I'm a hustler\n\n[Chorus]\nH-U-S-T-L-E-R hustler\nNew Jack, New Jack..........\n\n[Verse 3: Ice-T]\nHere I come, so you better break North\nAs I stride, my gold chains glide back and forth\nI care nothing 'bout you, and that's evident\nAll I love's my dope and dead presidents\nSound crazy? Well it isn't\nThe ends justifies the means, that's the system\nI learned that in school then I dropped out\nHit the streets, checked a grip, and now I got clout\nI had nothing, and I wanted it\nYou had everything, and you flaunted it\nTurned the needy into the greedy\nWith cocaine, my success came speedy\nGot me twisted, jammed into a paradox\nEvery dollar I get, another brother drops\nMaybe that's the plan, and I don't understand\nGod damn----you got me sinkin in quicksand\nBut since I don't know, and I ain't never learned\nI gotta get paid, I got money to earn\nWith my posse, out on the ave\nBump my sounds, crack a forty and laugh\nCool out and watch my new Benz gleam\nIs this a nightmare? Or the American dream?\nSo think twice if you're coming down my block\nYou wanna journey through hell? Well shit gets hot\nPregnant teens, children's screams\nLife is weighed on the scales of a triple beam\nYou don't come here much, and ya better not\nWrong move (bang), ambulance cot\nI gotta get more money than you got\nSo what, if some motherfucker gets shot?\nThat's how the game is played\nAnother brother slayed, the wound is deep\nBut they're givin us a band aid\nMy education's low but I got long dough\nI'm raised like a pit bull, my heart pumps nitro\nSleep on silk, lie like a politician\nMy Uzi's my best friend, cold as a mortician\nLock me up, it's genocidal catastrophe\nThere'll be another one after me!\nA hustler, hustler\n\n[Chorus]\nH-U-S-T-L-E-R hustler\nNew Jack, New Jack......"}}, {"title": "O.G.

Original Gangster", "year": "1991-05-14", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nTen years ago I used to listen to rappers flow\nTalkin' bout the way they rocked the mic at the disco\nI liked how that shit was goin' down\nDreamt about ripping the mic with my own sound\nSo I tried to write rhymes something like them\nMy boys said, \"That ain't you, Ice! That shit sounds like them.\"\nSo I sat back, thought up a new track\nDidn't fantasize, kicked the pure facts\nMotherfuckers got scared cause they was unprepared\nWho would tell it how it really was? Who dared?\nA motherfucker from the West Coast, L.A\nSouth Central, fool, where the Crips and the Bloods play\nWhen I wrote about parties, it didn't fit\n\"6 N' the Mornin,\" that was the real shit\n\n[Hook]\nO.G. Original Gangster\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen I wrote about parties, someone always died\nWhen I tried to write happy, yo, I knew I lied\n'Cause, I lived a life of crime Why play ya blind?\nA simple look and anyone with two cents would know I'm\nA hardcore player from the streets\nRapping bout hardcore topics over hardcore drum beats\nA little different than the average though\nJet you through the fast lane, drop ya on death row\nCause anybody who's been there knows that\nLife ain't so lovely on the blood-soaked fast track\nThat invincible shit don't work\nThrow ya in a joint, you'll be coming out feet first\nSo I blast the mic with my style\nSometimes I'm ill and other times buckwild\nBut the science is always there\nI'd be a true sucker if I acted like I didn't care\nI rap for brothers just like myself\nDazed by the game in a quest for extreme wealth\nBut I kick it to you hard and real\nOne wrong move, and your cap's peeled\nI ain't no super hero, I ain't no Marvel comic\nBut when it comes to game I'm atomic\nAt dropping it straight, point blank and untwisted\nNo imagination needed, cause I lived it\nThis ain't no fucking joke, this shit is real to me\nI'm Ice-T, O.G\n\n[Hook}\n\n[Verse 3]\nTwo weeks ago I was out at the disco\nTwo brothers stepped up to me and said, \"Hey yo, Ice\nWe don't think you're down. What set ya claiming?\"\nE drew the Glock, yo my set's aiming!\nDumb motherfucker, try to roll on me, please!\nI'm protected by a thousand emcees\nAnd hoodlums and hustlers and bangers with jheri curls\nWe won't even count the girls\nCause they got my back and I got theirs too\nFight for the streets when I'm on Oprah or Donahue\nThey try to sweat a nigga but they just didn't figure\nThat my wit's as quick as a hair trigger\n\"He's not your everyday-type prankster.\"\nI'm Ice-T, the original gangster\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 4]\nSo step to me if you think that you're ready to\nGot on your bullet proof? Well mine's going right thru\nThis ain't no game to me, it's hollow fame to me\nWithout respect from streets, so I don't claim be\nThe hardest motherfucker on earth\nCatch me slipping, I can't even get worked\nBut I don't slip that often, there's a coffin\nWaiting for the brother who comes off soft when\nThe real fucking shit goes down, take a look around\nAll them pussies can be found\nThey talk a mean fight but fight like hoes\nI'm from South Central, fool, where everything goes\nSnatch you out your car so fast you'll get whiplash\nNumbers on your rooftop for when the copters pass\nGangbangers don't carry no switchblades\nEvery kid's got a Tec 9 or a hand grenade\nThirty-seven killed last week in a crack war\nHostages tied up and shot in the liquor store\nNobody gives a fuck\n\"The children have to go to school!\" Well, moms, good luck!\nCause the shit's fucked up bad I use my pad and pen\nAnd my lyrics break out mad\nI try to write about fun and the good times\nBut the pen yanks away and explodes and destroys the rhyme\nMaybe it's just cause of where I'm from\nL.A. (*bang!*) that was a shotgun!\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/45bb8d8e0573aa4b17d0a8d970332fdc.529x532x1.jpg", "artist": "Ice-T", "raw": {"annotation_count": 15, "api_path": "/songs/23134", "apple_music_id": "345100790", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/23134/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "This is the 10th track from Ice t\u2019s fourth album, O.G.

mic at the disco\nI liked how that shit was goin' down\nDreamt about ripping the mic with my own sound\nSo I tried to write rhymes something like them\nMy boys said, \"That ain't you, Ice! That shit sounds like them.\"\nSo I sat back, thought up a new track\nDidn't fantasize, kicked the pure facts\nMotherfuckers got scared cause they was unprepared\nWho would tell it how it really was? Who dared?\nA motherfucker from the West Coast, L.A\nSouth Central, fool, where the Crips and the Bloods play\nWhen I wrote about parties, it didn't fit\n\"6 N' the Mornin,\" that was the real shit\n\n[Hook]\nO.G. Original Gangster\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen I wrote about parties, someone always died\nWhen I tried to write happy, yo, I knew I lied\n'Cause, I lived a life of crime Why play ya blind?\nA simple look and anyone with two cents would know I'm\nA hardcore player from the streets\nRapping bout hardcore topics over hardcore drum beats\nA little different than the average though\nJet you through the fast lane, drop ya on death row\nCause anybody who's been there knows that\nLife ain't so lovely on the blood-soaked fast track\nThat invincible shit don't work\nThrow ya in a joint, you'll be coming out feet first\nSo I blast the mic with my style\nSometimes I'm ill and other times buckwild\nBut the science is always there\nI'd be a true sucker if I acted like I didn't care\nI rap for brothers just like myself\nDazed by the game in a quest for extreme wealth\nBut I kick it to you hard and real\nOne wrong move, and your cap's peeled\nI ain't no super hero, I ain't no Marvel comic\nBut when it comes to game I'm atomic\nAt dropping it straight, point blank and untwisted\nNo imagination needed, cause I lived it\nThis ain't no fucking joke, this shit is real to me\nI'm Ice-T, O.G\n\n[Hook}\n\n[Verse 3]\nTwo weeks ago I was out at the disco\nTwo brothers stepped up to me and said, \"Hey yo, Ice\nWe don't think you're down. What set ya claiming?\"\nE drew the Glock, yo my set's aiming!\nDumb motherfucker, try to roll on me, please!\nI'm protected by a thousand emcees\nAnd hoodlums and hustlers and bangers with jheri curls\nWe won't even count the girls\nCause they got my back and I got theirs too\nFight for the streets when I'm on Oprah or Donahue\nThey try to sweat a nigga but they just didn't figure\nThat my wit's as quick as a hair trigger\n\"He's not your everyday-type prankster.\"\nI'm Ice-T, the original gangster\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 4]\nSo step to me if you think that you're ready to\nGot on your bullet proof? Well mine's going right thru\nThis ain't no game to me, it's hollow fame to me\nWithout respect from streets, so I don't claim be\nThe hardest motherfucker on earth\nCatch me slipping, I can't even get worked\nBut I don't slip that often, there's a coffin\nWaiting for the brother who comes off soft when\nThe real fucking shit goes down, take a look around\nAll them pussies can be found\nThey talk a mean fight but fight like hoes\nI'm from South Central, fool, where everything goes\nSnatch you out your car so fast you'll get whiplash\nNumbers on your rooftop for when the copters pass\nGangbangers don't carry no switchblades\nEvery kid's got a Tec 9 or a hand grenade\nThirty-seven killed last week in a crack war\nHostages tied up and shot in the liquor store\nNobody gives a fuck\n\"The children have to go to school!\" Well, moms, good luck!\nCause the shit's fucked up bad I use my pad and pen\nAnd my lyrics break out mad\nI try to write about fun and the good times\nBut the pen yanks away and explodes and destroys the rhyme\nMaybe it's just cause of where I'm from\nL.A.

I do what I like, I happen to like Rock'N'Roll\nAnd uhh..

in your music\nHow do you reply to that?\n\n[Ice-T replying]\nYou see, a lotta people don't realize that, you know\nRock'N'Roll is truly black music\nIt was created by Chuck Berry, Little Richard\nEven black people like that, who started it off back in the day\nYou know, and as far as I'm concerned music is music\nI don't look at it as Rock or R&B all that kind of stuff\nI just look at it as music, you know\nAnd anybody who said that I've sold out, they can basically suck my dick\nCause I really don't give a fuck about that shit, you know\nBut uhh.. I do what I like, I happen to like Rock'N'Roll\nAnd uhh.. I feel sorry for anybody who only listens to one form of music\nYou know, right now, I got my own Rock band, it's got to jump off\nIt's really black hardcore band called Body Count\nAnd uhh.. on some of the records I'm like laying some vocals on it\nAnd uhh.. I got a tape of it right here, yo, check it out\n\n[Song's Intro: Ice-T]\nYou know, sometimes I sit at home, you know, and I watch TV\nAnd I wonder what would be like to live in some place like\nYou know, The Cosby Show, Ozzie and Harriet\nYou know, where Cops come and got your cat outta the tree\nAll your friends died at old age\nBut you see.. I live in South Central, Los Angeles\nAnd unfortunately... SHIT AIN'T LIKE THAT!!\nIt's real fucked up!\n\n[Verse One: Ice-T]\nGod damn, what a brother gotta do\nTo get a message through\nTo the red and white and blue\nWhat? I gotta die before you realize\nI was a brother with opened eyes?\nThe world's insane while you drink champagne\nAnd I'm living in black reign\nYou try to ban the A.K\nI got ten of them stashed\nWith a case of hand grenades\n\n[Hook: Body Count]\n(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!\n(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!\n(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!\n(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!\n\n[Verse Two: Ice-T]\nYou'd know what to do\nIf your kid got killed on the way to school\nOr a cop shot your kid in the back yard\nShit would hit the fan motherfucker and it will hit real hard\nI hear it every night, another gun fight\nThe tension mounts, on with the Body Count\n\n[Break: Ice-T]\nYo Beatmaster V, take these motherfuckers to South Central\nHa ha ha, yeah, fuck that\nI hear it every night, another gun fight\nThe tension mounts, on with the Body Count\nLast weekend thirty seven kids killed in gang warfare in my back yard\nNO!!, NO!!, NO!!\nYo Ernie C, take these motherfuckers home, yeah\nYo, we're in the house, Body Count fool, 1991 motherfucker\nI hear it every night, another gun fight\nThe tension mounts, on with the Body Count\n\n[Verse Three: Ice-T]\nGod damn what a brother gotta do\nTo get a message through\nTo the red and white and you?\nWhat? I gotta die before you realize\nI was a nigga with opened eyes?\nThe world's insane while you drink champagne\nAnd I'm living in black reign\nDon't you hear the guns?\nYou stupid, dumb, dick sucking, bum politicians!!\n\n[Hook: Body Count]\n(Tell us what to do?)

more could you ask?\nBut then came remixes, scratching and cuts\nWhich was too much for many, drove some DJs nuts\nBut the DJ named Glove has reigned supreme\nAs the turntable wizard of the hip-hop scene\nSo listen to him, check him out, but remember this\nWhen The Glove's on the wheels of steel he's Reckless\n\n[Verse 2]\nThis high-powered music is truly unique\nAs The Glove cuts the rhythm to the hip-hop beat\nHe moves like a madman as he spins his disc\nHe's the number one scratcher on the DJ list, he's Reckless\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow I've seen DJ's, too many to name\nSome gained recognition and even fame\nBut when you talk of MC's, Ice-T is the best\nAnd when you talk of DJ's, forget the rest, Glove's Reckless\n\n[Verse 4]\nSo listen very closely as The Glove throws down\nHe cuts like a razor to the big beat sound\nDave's layin' down a groove that we know you'll like\nWith The Glove on the turntables and Ice-T on the mic, we're Reckless\n\n[Verse 5]\nSo listen to the music, let your mind feel free\nRealize you're with the master G-L-O-V-E\nDave and MC Ice-T, you know you're with the best\nBecause when we're in the mix you know the groove is fresh\nAnd Reckless, Reckless,

"[Intro]\nHey, boy!\n\n[Verse 1]\nOnce upon a time a DJ's task\nWas just to play records, what more could you ask?\nBut then came remixes, scratching and cuts\nWhich was too much for many, drove some DJs nuts\nBut the DJ named Glove has reigned supreme\nAs the turntable wizard of the hip-hop scene\nSo listen to him, check him out, but remember this\nWhen The Glove's on the wheels of steel he's Reckless\n\n[Verse 2]\nThis high-powered music is truly unique\nAs The Glove cuts the rhythm to the hip-hop beat\nHe moves like a madman as he spins his disc\nHe's the number one scratcher on the DJ list, he's Reckless\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow I've seen DJ's, too many to name\nSome gained recognition and even fame\nBut when you talk of MC's, Ice-T is the best\nAnd when you talk of DJ's, forget the rest, Glove's Reckless\n\n[Verse 4]\nSo listen very closely as The Glove throws down\nHe cuts like a razor to the big beat sound\nDave's layin' down a groove that we know you'll like\nWith The Glove on the turntables and Ice-T on the mic, we're Reckless\n\n[Verse 5]\nSo listen to the music, let your mind feel free\nRealize you're with the master G-L-O-V-E\nDave and MC Ice-T, you know you're with the best\nBecause when we're in the mix you know the groove is fresh\nAnd Reckless, Reckless, Reck-Reck-Re-Reckless"}}, {"title": "Gangsta Rap", "album": "Gangsta Rap", "year": null, "lyrics": "[Opening

'burbs got heat\nA ghetto is a ghetto and a street is a street\nEliminate the poverty disease\nAnd we'll start rapping about birds and trees\nYou can get shot, no matter how much fucking cash you got\nYou can never get away, the streets stay hot (*Gunshot*)\nAnd gangsters ain't the ones to push\nThey'll kill you a second ask president Bush\n\n[Hook: Ice-T X2]"}}, {"title": "Money, Power &

out\nDropped two nines in his forehead\nEvil was bleedin' bad\nThe car seats were turnin' red\nLooked to my left\nThere were two more carloads\nNiggas in hats and hoods\nIn an attack mode\nAnd they hadn't yet begun to fight\nE hit the gas\nIt was one past midnight!\n\nWe boned down Vernon\nRight on Normandie\nLeft on Florence\nGettin' through the E.T.G.'s\nSpun out on Vermont\nMade a left on Colden\nRight on Hoover\n\"E, where we goin'?\"\nHe didn't even answer that\nChecked the rear view\nThey were still out back\nWhere were these brothers from?\nWhat made these brothers come?\nBang! Our back window\nWas removed by a shotgun\nNow Hen G was shot\nDon caught a ricochet\nThese motherfuckers was ill\nThey didn't come to play\nBust a right turn, parked\nAnd then we got left\nHid in the the bushes\nShot the gas tank to fake death\nBut would this really\nKeep them psyched?\nThree of us bleedin'\nIt was ten past midnight!\n\nI really didn't like\nHow this shit was goin' down\nWrong night, wrong time\nWrong fuckin' part of town\nYa see we was deep\nIn the Hoover's hood\nThree niggas bleedin'\nThat shit don't look good!\nSee over there red don't go\nSome places red's all they know\nBut not our luck\nTonight we was real fucked\nBroke down an alley\nAnd we instantly had to duck\nFuckin' police on a gang sweep\nNo time to deal with one time\nSo we had to creep\nBroke through a back yard\nRan through a vacant lot\nE, Hen and Don kept up\nTo be some niggas shot\nShit was gettin' crazy\nSo I had to get busy\nHen was bleedin' worse\nAnd Evil was gettin' dizzy\nLooked in a parking lot\nI needed a snatch bar\nHad to hot wire\nSo I moved on an old car\nIt was a bucket, but fuck it, it had to do\nStarted it up\nAnd scooped my whole crew\nTwo blocks later\nWe saw fuckin' blue lights\nThe pigs were behind us\nIt was half past midnight!\n\nWhen they pulled us over\nShit got worse\nI waited till they got out\nAnd then I hit reverse\nFucked 'em up, I seen one cop fall\nThrew it in gear, yo I'm outty y'all\nDon't know how\nBut somehow we got away\nLost the jackers, the cops\nDumped the G.T.A\nMade it back to the hood\nFixed the crew up\nAnd even though Evil's car blew up\nWe made it home and then I crashed out\nThinkin' bout my all-night death bout\nThen somethin' woke me up\nFrom my dark sleep\nThe sound of fuckin' police\nWhen they're tryin' to creep\nBroke through my door\nWith no goddamn warning\nLooked at my watch\nIt was six in the mornin'"}}, {"title": "Bitches 2", "album": "O.G.

topical,vividly optical\nListen,you'll see'em sometimes I'll be'em\nCops,critics and punks,never ever want to see me in POWER\nWell,that's too bad,Apocalypse Now I'm back and I'm mad\nWe're comin',you're runnin' cold and cunning\nIce T on the mic,TopGunning\nAfter your neck,checkin' respect,makin' you sweat\nRhyme Syndicate boy in effect\nThe rap motivator,teacher,talker,night rhyme stalker\nWords thrillin',so real they're chillin',the hit author\nGettin' louder than a shot gun,you don't want none\nRHYME PAYS was the name of the album\nBut that was number one,this is the number two\nThe posse grew,we're gonna break through\n\nPower\n\nSomebody line up the suckers who refuse to recognize the truth\nTie up the punks who refuse to understand the youth\nMy posse's growin' and it's gettin' larger every day\nDetroit,Chi-Town,Pittsburgh,Houston,L.A\nCome on,come on,come on,toys,let's play\nCircle the calendar,perpetrator doomsday\nICE T fool man of my own full grown\nI cause havoc when I speak upon the microphone\nI'm outspoken,no jokin',get in my face your jaw will get broken\nLayin' it,sayin' it,then you're playing it\nLyrics so heavy that you might try weighin' it\nHated by many but I hate'em back\nLoved by troopers who know where it's at\nYou might like me,might think I'm wack\nBut don't step to me cause the boy stays strapped\nI'm taking no shorts,hatin' the courts,hatin' the judges\nPunk DA's with their personal grudges\nI hate the clubs that think with their butts\nNo hats,no jeans,no sneakers,no what?\nNo beepers,no gold? Yo kiss my ass\nWe'll wait and see who gets the last laugh\nWe'll have the power\n\nPower (x3)\n\nPower it starts with P like pussy\nShe knows she's got it,she doesn't worry,does she?\nSpendin' your cash,leavin' you in the trash\nWhile your little head's thinkin',they're gone in a dash\nThey got it,know it,that's why they show it\nThe power of sex,if man could overthrow it\nHe'd be king in a day,no way.We get rich,hard,give it away\nWe're weak and as we speak,the girls are hawkin'\nSizin' me up straight out as I'm talkin'\nBut you gotta have control if you want the gold\nI don't wanta be alone like Stallone\nSo I keep my mind thinkin' 'bout the green\nAnd stop dwellin' on the in-between\nI got the power\n\nPower\n\nI'm on a mission mackin' hard as a hammer\nTake my picture,I might take your camera\nMy posse might move,and they move fast\nA fool's move could be a punk's last\nAin't no criminal although I used to be\nAin't no new jack rappin' ain't new to me\nI been makin' records on wax since 1982\nNow it's 1988 finally I'm coming through\nThat adds up to six years of makin' ok jams,but now I'm mad\nHere comes the body slam\nTurnin' out concerts,house'n the industry\nLovin' all the fly girls screamin' for ICE T\nRollin' with the Syndicate my unstoppable battalion\n38 Solid gold my medalion\nGainin' velocity,momentum and energy\nICE Capital T\nI got the power\n\nPower\n\nSo you say that I'm a fake think,you really must be a fool\nI been to jail more times than you have probably been in school\nShot at,shot back,hit,and seen my buddies killed\nThat's the foundation upon the raps of ICE-T are built\nI say what I think,the system does stink\nMoney you walk,you short,you're writin' from the klink\nCome on,what's up,you know the laws are full of bull\nPrey on the lame,release those with pull\nPower!I know you wanta try it\nWell check out money can buy it\nControl and mold the world to do your wishin'\nThe knowledge of power is mine,so just

(x4)\n\nI was in a contest to rock the world\nFirst prize was a virgin young girl\nFor four days I was up on the mic\nAll sucker MC's were on the bite\nBittin' my rhymes,stealin' my style\nI rocked so hard, it wasn't true\nI won the virgin girl, and her MAMA too\n\nSex (x4)\n\nWhen I'm upon the microphone\nAll the fly young ladies want a take me home\nWhen the party's over,take me to their house\nThrow me in the bed, know what we're talkin' about?\nThen they say,\" Ice-T you are the best\nI love your eyes\nYour things, your chest\nYou put all my lovers to shame\nI can't remember my boyfriends name\nYou made me feel all hot and wet\nThe way you move I can't forget\nI came, I came, I came again it felt so good I told my friends\nYou can have my cars,my jewels,my wealth\nI love you more than I love myself\nAfter tonight fulfilled I'll be\nNo hundred men could match ICE-T\n\nSex (x4)\n\nThen she turn out the lights,throw back the sheets\nAnd then our two hot bodies meet\nAnd all at once she felt the thrill\nThe caress of the best, the Ice-T chill\nStart with her tongue upon the back of my leg\nShe didn't stop till I hollered screamed and begged\nThen she rolled me over, took me to the stage\nLike in the nasty book where you tore out the page\n\nSex (x4)\n\nI put it in their blouse\nIn their brain their little panties that their boyfriend saw\nI put it in their mini skirt and up their thigh\nDeep,deep girls, I wanna make you cry\nI move it in and out, know what I'm talkin' about\nThen around your neck until you show respect\nThen on your cheek until I reach my peak\nThen in your mouth girl, no joke,I'll take it out\nDon't want to see you choke\nI'll run it down your back, might cause a heart attack\nI'll put it in your butt until I get enough\nAnd then I'll take it out and put it in my pants\nCause I fuck with the beat, the only way to dance\n\nSex (x4)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4087bd0151e7fc336a1bdb7aca3ef257.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist":

stay alive\nWithout a .....sex drive\n\nSex (x4)\n\nI was in a contest to rock the world\nFirst prize was a virgin young girl\nFor four days I was up on the mic\nAll sucker MC's were on the bite\nBittin' my rhymes,stealin' my style\nI rocked so hard, it wasn't true\nI won the virgin girl, and her MAMA too\n\nSex (x4)\n\nWhen I'm upon the microphone\nAll the fly young ladies want a take me home\nWhen the party's over,take me to their house\nThrow me in the bed, know what we're talkin' about?\nThen they say,\" Ice-T you are the best\nI love your eyes\nYour things, your chest\nYou put all my lovers to shame\nI can't remember my boyfriends name\nYou made me feel all hot and wet\nThe way you move I can't forget\nI came, I came, I came again it felt so good I told my friends\nYou can have my cars,my jewels,my wealth\nI love you more than I love myself\nAfter tonight fulfilled I'll be\nNo hundred men could match ICE-T\n\nSex (x4)\n\nThen she turn out the lights,throw back the sheets\nAnd then our two hot bodies meet\nAnd all at once she felt the thrill\nThe caress of the best, the Ice-T chill\nStart with her tongue upon the back of my leg\nShe didn't stop till I hollered screamed and begged\nThen she rolled me over, took me to the stage\nLike in the nasty book where you tore out the page\n\nSex (x4)\n\nI put it in their blouse\nIn their brain their little panties that their boyfriend saw\nI put it in their mini skirt and up their thigh\nDeep,deep girls, I wanna make you cry\nI move it in and out, know what I'm talkin' about\nThen around your neck until you show respect\nThen on your cheek until I reach my peak\nThen in your mouth girl, no joke,I'll take it out\nDon't want to see you choke\nI'll run it down your back, might cause a heart attack\nI'll put it in your butt until I get enough\nAnd then I'll take it out and put it in my pants\nCause I fuck with the beat, the only way to dance\n\nSex (x4)"}}, {"title": "The Iceberg", "album": "The Iceberg /

back\nPuerto-Ricans gettin dissed the same\nWon't speak on the Indians, shit's insane\nFuck John Wayne\nI don't hate whites\nI just got a death wish for muthafuckas that ain't right\nYou got black skin\nStill you gotta show and prove, friend\nBack to the facts\nWhat about Australia?\nA fuckin failure\nThe Aboriginal people are black\nSo they got jacked\nYou ask me about free speech and the Riots?\nSo what's in store?\nI'm talkin bout a race war\n\n(Get yourself together)\n(Upen your eyes\nGet wise)\n(Put your brain in gear)\n\nRace war\nPeople gettin killed in the street\nBlood on your feet, the ends don't meet\nAnd who they gonna blame it on, me?\nTry the media\nTry the P.D\nTry your TV\nTry your quest for wealth\nAnybody but yourself\nBut once the bullets start flyin\nPeople start dyin\nIt's all because we're lyin\nHistory books that teach hate\nA kid has no escape\nFrom the racist fate\nAnd pretty soon South Africa\nWill stop chillin\nAnd start killin\n\nRace war (8X)\n\nEvery night I pray\nThat people get this shit together one day\nBut this country ain't with it\nAmerica was founded on that racist shit\nI judge the devil by his deeds\nIt's usually connected to the size of his greed\nAnd keep the hope\nEven though they'd love to give a nigga like me the rope\nAnd when this shit hits\nThere's gonna be a lotta white kids rollin with the Africans\nYou can't sweat skin\nCause there'll be a lot of blacks is down with the Republicans\nThis shit don't have to happen\nThat's why a brother like me's still rappin\nJust treat each other right\nEither that, or you're lookin for a sure fight\nFuck the police\nWe already know they ain't about no fuckin peace\nYou wanna know what I think's in store?\nJustice or a race war\n\n(Get yourself together)\n(Upen your eyes\nGet wise)\nRace war\n(Get yourself together)\n(Upen your eyes\nGet wise)\n(Put your brain in gear)\nRace war\n(Get yourself together)\n(Upen your eyes\nGet wise)\n(Put your brain in gear)\nRace war\n(Get yourself together)\n(Upen your eyes\nGet wise)\n(Put your brain in gear)\n\nKorean people live down in the hood\nA little mis-fuckin-understood\nOrientals were slaves too\nWord to this fuckin red white and blue\nPeople from Iran ain't never did shit to us\nSo why the distrust?\nThe system wanna keep us at each other's throats\nWhile we're payin the tax notes\nCause bein black ain't no fuckin minority\nIt's the fuckin majority\nSo they gotta make us hate each other\nWord, check the brothers\nMexicans - black\nJamaicans - black\nIranians - black\nIndians - black\nHawaiians - black\nPuerto-Ricans - black\nEskimos - black\nSouth-Americans - black\nOrientals - black\nYeah, that's right\nThe Klan says everything's black that ain't white\nSo we gotta get our facts straight\nCause the shit they teach in school is pure hate\nSometimes I don't know for sure\nIf somebody want a race war\n\n(Get yourself together)\n(Upen your eyes\nGet wise)\nRace war\n(Get yourself together)\n(Upen your eyes\nGet wise)\n(Put your brain in gear)\nRace war\n(Get yourself together)\n(Upen your eyes\nGet wise)\n(Put your brain in gear)\nRace war\n(Get yourself together)\n(Upen your

The Blacks?\nOr just the gun tower!\n\nIn a blink of an eye, a riot broke out\nBlacks put their backs to the wall\nCause it was north and south\nA gun man shouts\nAnd everybody had doubt\nUntil the bullets started fly'n\nTook two men out\nThen they rushed everybody\nBack to their cells\nDamn the pen is different than\nThe county jail\nI'm in a one man cell\nI know my life's on a scale\nI wonder if that gunman is goin' to hell\nThis is my second day\nI got a ten year stay\nI learned my first lesson\nIn the pen you don't plaay\nI saw a brother kill another\nCause he said he was gay\nBut that's the way it is\nIt been that way for years\nAnd when his body hit the ground\nI heard a couple of cheers\nIt kind of hurt me inside\nThat they were glad he died\nAnd I ask myself\nJust who had the power?\nThe Whites?

The subject is the penitentiary system.  The subject of the rap arrives at a prison, and witnesses violence immediately.  In the last verse, he attacks two (perhaps more) men and becomes a \u201clifer\u201d \u2013 someone who is condemned to spend the rest of their life in prison.\n\nThe rap is also notable for a condemnation of homophobia in the second verse.

Original Gangster\nSong: The Tower\n\nI'm rollin' up in a big gray bus\nAnd I'm shackled down\nMyself that's who I trust\nThe minute I arrived\nSome sucker got hit\nShanked ten times\nBehind some bullshit\nWord in the pen the fool was a snitch\nSo without hesitatin'\nI made a weapon quick\nIf found a sharp piece of metal\nTaped it to a stick\nThen a bullhorn sounds\nThat means it's time for chow\nMy first prison meal\nThe whole feeling was foul\nIt wasn't quite my style\nBut my stomach growled\nSo I washed the shit down\nAnd hit the weight pile\nThe brothers was swole\nThe attitudes was cold\nFelt the tension on the yard\nFrom the young and the old\nBut I'm a warrior\nI got my ground to hold\nSo I studied the inmates\nTo see who had the power\nThe Whites? The Blacks?\nOr just the gun tower!\n\nIn a blink of an eye, a riot broke out\nBlacks put their backs to the wall\nCause it was north and south\nA gun man shouts\nAnd everybody had doubt\nUntil the bullets started fly'n\nTook two men out\nThen they rushed everybody\nBack to their cells\nDamn the pen is different than\nThe county jail\nI'm in a one man cell\nI know my life's on a scale\nI wonder if that gunman is goin' to hell\nThis is my second day\nI got a ten year stay\nI learned my first lesson\nIn the pen you don't plaay\nI saw a brother kill another\nCause he said he was gay\nBut that's the way it is\nIt been that way for years\nAnd when his body hit the ground\nI heard a couple of cheers\nIt kind of hurt me inside\nThat they were glad he died\nAnd I ask myself\nJust who had the power?\nThe Whites? The Blacks?\nOr just the gun tower!\n\nYou see the Whites got a thing\nThe call White pride\nThe Blacks got the muscle\nMexicans got the knives\nYou better be wise\nYou wanna stay alive\nGo toe to toe with a sucka\nNo matter wht size\nA fool tried to sweat me\nAct'n like he was hard\nI stuck him twice in the neck\nAnd left him dead in the yard\nIt was smooth how I did it\nCause nobody could see\nWith my jacket on my arm\nAnd my knife on the side of me\nBam bam, it was over\nAnother one bites the dust\nI went crazy in the pen\nWith nobody to trust\nBench'n ten quarters, so I'm hard to sweat\nUsed a tat gun, and engrved my set\nThey call me a lifer\nCause I'm good as dead\nI live in the hole, so the floor's my bed\nAnd I ask myself again\nWho has the power\nThe Whites? The Blacks?\nOr just the gun tower"}}, {"title": "Evil E: What About Sex?", "album": "O.G.

null, "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSpeed of life, fast\nIt's like walking barefoot over broken glass\nIt's like, jumping rope on a razor blade\nAll lightning quick decisions are made\nLifestyle plush, females rush\nThis high profile personality, who earns his pay illegally\nProfessional liar, schoolboys admire\nYoung girls desire, very few live to retire\nCash flow extreme, dress code supreme, vocabulary obscene\nDefinition-street player, you know what I mean\nThe high rollers (x2)\n\n[Verse 2]\nPeople of the city stop fooling yourself\nCrime rules the streets, who the hell else\nAll the police have gone out to play\nBecause for enough cold cash they'll look the other way\nJust look at the cars as they go by\nBenzes, Ferraris, trucks up high\nBeepers connecting players to big-time deals\nWith all of this technology who needs to steal\nJust live a life of leisure every night and day\nAnd you're living proof that crime does pay\nYour life is dangerous and reckless\nYou eat fly guys and girls for breakfast\nYou're a titan of the nuclear age\nYour muscles flex with a Uzi or 12 gauge\nAnd you love the game that's why y'all boast\nBecause you're high priced high speed high post\nHigh roller\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhen I say high rollers, I mean the best\nForget the half-steppers, eject the rest\nBecause these high ranked officials of our city streets\nMake millions all triggered by electric beeps\nThey dress in diamonds and rope chains\nThey got the blood of Scarface runnin' through their veins\nSilk shirts, leather suits\nHair always fresh, eel-skin boots\nLarge hearts \u2013 though their sizes vary\nBankrolls that take 2 pockets to carry\nCruising in their 500 Benz Sedan\nWith their systems peaked out rockin' Pusherman\nYes, their fashion's high and hard to beat\nThey buy their Gucci from Gucci's, not the swap meet\nEat very well, much clientele\nAnd whatever you need, they probably sell\nThe high rollers\n\n[Verse 4]\nOh yes, I'm here to tell you females also roll\nDrive the same cars, sometimes wear more gold\nCold as an igloo, or hot as a flame\nThey'll shake ya, break ya and you won't know their name\nGangsters to the max all marks will be taxed\nThese girls drive Ferraris not Cadillacs\nRespect is demanded most men don't understand it\nTill they peep the huge bank that these girls have landed\nThey're junkies for fun love life on the run\nAnd if things get hot, they will pull a gun\nPrey on the lame no shame to the game\nAnd they all seek power fuck the fame\nThe high rollers\n\n[Verse 5]\nNow radio stations probably won't play\nThis record because of the things I say\nThey'll say I'm glamorizing the hustling hood\nAnd a record like this can do no good\nBut I'm not here to tell ya right or wrong\nI don't know which side of the law you belong\nYes, the game has flash, but sometimes hurts\nBehind any mistake, hard times lurks\nAnd jail's not your only problem though it may seem\nYou just may die by a barrage from an M-16\nBut to each his own, choose the mobile phone\nThe tailored suit, the luxury home\nYou'll never get caught cause you got nerves of ice\nAnd you're much smarter than those crooks on Miami Vice\nRight?\nYou wanna be a high roller\nYou wanna be a high roller", "image": "https://images.genius.com/90b363e617bc82f06e45c5cc1d830e6a.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Ice-T", "raw":

any mistake, hard times lurks\nAnd jail's not your only problem though it may seem\nYou just may die by a barrage from an M-16\nBut to each his own, choose the mobile phone\nThe tailored suit, the luxury home\nYou'll never get caught cause you got nerves of ice\nAnd you're much smarter than those crooks on Miami Vice\nRight?\nYou wanna be a high roller\nYou wanna be a high roller"}}, {"title":

dope track\nCause once I hit it with the vocal tone\nIt's mine, have motherfuckers\nRushing to rewind\nCause I'll flow slow\nAnd still twist your tongues up\nRock the house from night\nTill the sun's up\nCause it really ain't\nHow much you say\nIt's what you say\nI got no fucking time on the mic\nTo play\nI write rhymes\nWith addition and algebra\nMental geometry\nDon't even come at me\nTalking that weak and\nPopping that bullshit\nGet out my face\nA fool could get his head split\nA lot of doubters\nSaid it couldn't be done by me\nThem same suckers\nAre now looking from under me\nWondering what I did\nI didn't play myself kid\nI respected my fans\nAnd made the high bid\nSometimes I write my rhymes\nAt night and fall asleep\nWake up with new techniques\nGrab the pen\nAnd place it on some loose leaf\nNothing soft, always the tough meat\nThe white paper and\nBlue lines excite my mind\nNot allowing me to stop the rhyme\nUntil the whole motherfucking\nBook's complete\nThen I write on the\nBack of the sheets\nI made a promise\nTo my brothers in street crime\nWe'd get paid with the use\nOf a sweet rhyme\nWe put our minds together\nMade the tracks clever\nNow we're checking\nMore bank than ever\n\n[Hook]\nMind over matter\n(So you gotta have mind power, like the fellas say)\nMind over matter\n(Mind power)\n\nI can drop rhymes in twos\nAnd threes and fours\nAnd still have much shit\nLeft for encores\nCause once my mind locks\nIn on a dope idea\nMotherfucking ducks\nShould stand clear\nCause I'm a hit the topic point blank\nIt's jail ya better keep your shank\nCause I got mine\nAnd I'm out on a solo creep\n(Uggga!) Your face hits the concrete\nYou wanna roll\nWith the niggas that don't play\nI think you got false courage\nGet out my damn way\nCause the car I'm in\nIs rolling full of men\nNot kids or boys, E got the Mac 10\nIslam's got the Zulu Nation back up\nDJ Aladdin to\nHook the fucking track up\nSyndicate's making the move\nWith the ski masks\nAnd I'm housing the long cash\nSo now you realize\nYou underestimated the Ice\nYou thought that I was OK\nBut now you realize I'm nice\nBut that's alright\nCause I knew I'd make it in the end\nThose who like me now\nMight not have liked me then\nBut I'mma keep impressing\nStressing my lesson\nAnd keep motherfuckers guessing\nArmor plate my mind\nWith walls and shields\nAs I escape from the killing fields\n\n[Hook]\n(I can understand)\nMind over matter\n(I know what it means)\n(Mind power)\nMind over matter\n(Mind over matter)\nMind over matter\n(Mind over matter)\nMind over matter\n(Mind over matter)\n\nWise up\nMove to the tempo of this hype groove\nYou know this shit is dope\nSo what you trying to prove\nVU's max as Evil E\nMy nigga dogs the wax\nMy brain's a hand grenade--catch\nI'mma hit you with an overload\nOf bottomless thought\nReversing all the shit you're taught\nThen throw words at you\nSyl-la-ble-at-a-time\nYour brain recites the rhyme\nNo matter what you do\nThe power's over you\nWhen you sleep\nYou'll be saying these rhymes too\nCause the brain has the power\nTo control all\nThink positive\nYou'll be unable to fall\nBrain cells swell\nThought process becomes a trance\nMakes you feel possessed to dance\nI'll say I want a million\nMy mind is so deep\nI'll be busting a check for it next week\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "First Impression", "album": "O.G.

Pop! Pop! To the dome\n\n[Chorus]\n\nIt's the G-style\nGangsta style\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nG Style, The gangsta talk\nI got a teflon .9\nAnd it eats vest\nI take a motherfucker out quick\nJust for talkin shit\nRide Rolls\nCatch hoes like a mitt\nLA, Atlanta, New York\nYo, my shit rocks\nChi-town, Miami, Detroit\nI get much props\nBecause I roll with the hardcore G\nEvery street's the same street to me\nI don't bullshit\nI don't quit\nWritin a rhyme fit\nKKK pray each day\nThat I get hit\nMotherfuckers try to flip on the Icepick\nMove and slip\nClose the eyes and catch a fuckin clip\nNot in the ghetto no more\nBut I do hang\nGot a black game\nAnd it's sittin on them thangs\nI kick the game from the street\nNot the slamma\nTighten up my knockas with a big lead hammer\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse Three]\n\nSome of the times\nI write my raps with extreme speed\nSome of the times\nI take the pen and make pads bleed\nMy mind clicks to Homocide\nBullets fly\nLadies cry\nA lot of people die\nSome nights I can't right\nStare at the blue lines\nI think I'm a go blind\nThen the beat becomes me\nSit in the dark\nAnd write a whole fuckin LP\nG Style, the gangsta talk\nNever near soft\nHard as a knockout bout\nIt's no sellout\nI keep crime in my rhyme\nCause it's my thing\nPacked with guns\nAnd drugs\nAnd lots of street slang\nA-B-C-D-E-F, and LAPD\nWords from a motherfuckin OG\nAmmo Dump pumps the sounds that you bump in your trunk\nSo turn it up punk\nWhat'cha fraid of?\nWhat'cha made of?\nPull the pin\nSet the grenade off\nBlastin sounds out ya jeep\nOn every city street, nigga\nStraight gangsta beat\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse Four]\n\nMany like to dress the style, and act hardcore\nMany motherfuckers are and they crack jaws\nI like to lay in the cut\nIn a nightclub\nDon't smoke bud\nDrink suds\nBut I gets loved, mack, cool\nI scope the freak with the mad backs\nHit her with the gangsta style\nCool, relaxed, bam\nPut her in the Benz\nBump Too $hort, let her know\nRight off the top, what's my sport\nYou think long\nYou think wrong\nYou got it goin on, baby doll?\nBut I won't sing you no love song\nYou either love me\nOr you don't\nYou're either rollin tonight\nOr you won't\nShe likes the style\nCause it don't bullshit around\nTounge in my ear, real slow\nAnd then it went down\nI gotta flip into a ill mode\nPack a clip full of hype tracks\nAnd then unload\nMusic for the hardcore beatdown\nNo weak pop shit\nStrictly underground\nAnd if you don't like the style, as I get wreck\nEase back nigga, catch a knife through the neck\n\n[Chorus]", "image":

I met this girl the other night\nHype super-dope body and face, her mini-skirt tight\nTalkin' 'bout legs and lips, mindblowin' hips\nHad to cross my legs just to look at her tits\nSaid she came out lookin' for some fun\nLooked me in my eyes and told me...I was the one\nI said \"Why?\", she said I was fly\nGrabbed me by my hand and I thought I would die\nSaid she wanted to take me home to make love\nNow that's the kind of rap that brothers dream of\nI said, \"Fast, slow, hard or soft, baby?\"\nShe said, \"All the above\"\n\n[Hook]\nThis girl tried to kill me\nShe didn't use a gun or a knife\nThis girl tried to kill me\nTook me within a inch of my life\n\n[Verse Two]\nNow, I ain't no sucker on the weak tip\nBut let me tell you, she was on some motherfuckin' sex trip\nTook me to her crib that night, leather and spikes\nBroke out the rope and the dope strobe-light\nAnd started buggin', lightin' candles all over the room\nThen she did a backflip, landed on my dick\nI knew that I would be dead soon\n\n[Hook]\nThis girl tried to kill me\nShe didn't use a gun or a knife\nThis girl tried to kill me\nTook me within a inch of my life\nThis girl tried to kill me\nShe didn't use a

say \"No!\"\nIt was like a rodeo, I was with a sex nut\nI looked in her face...\nShe sweated and she grinned with delight\nAnd then she broke out a whip, I said \"Shit!\"\nThis girl had crazy plans

spike-heeled boots\nOversized vibrators so that she could get loose\nI said, \"Don't...don't...don't whip me!\nI'll do anything you ask!\"\nAnd then homegirl stripped, 38\" tits\nMan you shoulda seen that ass\n\n[Hook]\nThis girl tried to kill me\nShe didn't use a gun or a knife\nThis girl tried to kill me\nTook me within a inch of my life\nThis freak tried to kill me\nShe didn't use a bomb or a

gimme gimme\"\nJumped on my Jimmy, and rode me like the Wild West\nI almost passed out, then the front door cold bust in\nIt was her fuckin' husband, six-foot ten\nI knew my life would soon

Word! You full of shit!\n\nCheck this out, moms, I said time bomb\nAnd they sit in your house and remain calm\nTill you feed'em lies and the flip\nStart talkin' crazy shit (Fuck you!)\nMight call you and pops a fool\nTell ya that's why they hate school\nBeen offensive and askin' questions\nGive your brain indigestion\nWhy? Why? Because I have indoctrinated the youth\nYhey're mentally intoxicated with truth\nSo they know the noise you talk are lies\nPretty damn soon they'll be by (I'm outta here)\nThey listen to me and I give'em the real\nAnd every night caps get peeled\nAnd every night a ho gets smacked\nA fool gets jacked\nNow, whose fuckin' fault was that?\nThe home invaders...\n\nYo!

What did I do?\nJust say truth motherfucka and it's comin' through\nI tell you what we did: we stole your fuckin' kids\nThe home invader...\n\nAll right! we got the motherfuckin' kids!\nWe outta here!

Word! You full of shit!\n\nCheck this out, moms, I said time bomb\nAnd they sit in your house and remain calm\nTill you feed'em lies and the flip\nStart talkin' crazy shit (Fuck you!)\nMight call you and pops a fool\nTell ya that's why they hate school\nBeen offensive and askin' questions\nGive your brain indigestion\nWhy? Why? Because I have indoctrinated the youth\nYhey're mentally intoxicated with truth\nSo they know the noise you talk are lies\nPretty damn soon they'll be by (I'm outta here)\nThey listen to me and I give'em the real\nAnd every night caps get peeled\nAnd every night a ho gets smacked\nA fool gets jacked\nNow, whose fuckin' fault was that?\nThe home invaders...\n\nYo! Yo! Yo!\nAll that shit you taught me, mom, was full of shit!\nKnow what I'm sayin'?\nHow the fuck you gonna tell me to run my motherfuckin' life?\nBitch! You dont even know who the fuck you are!\nYou talkin' about you don't like rap, you don't like how I dress!\nYo! Fuck you and pops! I'm outta here!\nBoth of y'all can kiss my ass...\n\nAll cops want me, so does the F.B.I\nBecause my rhymes are fly\nThey still tryin' to stop me, shut me down, block me\nMake motherfuckas boycott me\nBut that will never happen, it's impossible\nI move straight through all obstacles\nThey say I'm fuckin' up the minds of little kids\nBut half of my fans are in college\nP.M.R.C. suck my dick, please\nYou can kiss my ass while you're on your knees\nWord! You're listening to the verbal assassinator\nE's the crossfader, your factual updater\nUntil your cranium grows like uranium\nHard as titanium, parents, I'm blamin'em\nFor teachin' you lies about life, racist viewpoints\nAnd other trite bullshit they learned back in the day\nWhile I learned about death from an A.K\nBut they'll never quite understand\nBam, bam, bam, no gat is the Walkman\nBoom, bash, yeah, yo, it's goin' down\nMe and Ice Cube are in town\nBut the fuckin' pigs cancelled the concert\nThey're just scared of some niggers that do work\nWhat they do? What did I do?\nJust say truth motherfucka and it's comin' through\nI tell you what we did: we stole your fuckin' kids\nThe home invader...\n\nAll right! we got the motherfuckin' kids!\nWe outta here!

JVC's\nMotorola Phones, Sony Color TV's\nHad the ride packed up 'til we heard \"Freeze\"\nFuckin' blue lights, read 'em their rights\n\nDrama (x4)\n\n4 in the morning, lights in my face\nThat's the time, you know the place\nCuffed in the room with the two-way glass\nDetects in effect cold doggin' my ass\n\"What's your date of birth?\" \"What's your real name?\"\nI stuck to my alias, I know the game\nIf they don't know who you are, then they don't know what you've done\n\"You're just makin' this harder on yourself, son\"\nI know this shit by heart, I'm too clever\n\"Have you ever been arrested before?\" Nope, never\nD.A. reject all over his face\nYou see, no confession, no case\nThen my boy started illin', talkin' and tellin'\nSon of a bitch, he was a snitch\n\nDrama (x6)\n\nUnder I went, I caught a case and half\nHe dropped the mallet, then the judge laughed\nNow I'm in the penzo, chillin' like a real pro\nI can't move 'til the man says go\nA puppet of the big game, an institutional thing\nI wouldn't be here if I fed my brain\nGot knowledge from school books, instead of street crooks\nNow all I get is penitentiary hard looks\nThe joint is like an oven of caged heat\nYou're just a number, another piece of tough meat\nKillers and robbers are all you greet\nAct soft you will get beat\nOn death row they got their own hot seat\nFor those who feel that they are truly elite\nThe last thing you see's a priest\nThe lights dim, your life ends\n\nDrama"}}, {"title": "Shut Up, Be Happy", "album": "The Iceberg / Freedom of Speech...

"Artist: Ice-T\nAlbum: Home Invasion\nSong: That's How I'm Livin\n\nI was born in New Jersey, I said it before\nBut I guess nobody heard me\nMy mother died young\nNo sisters or brothers, I was the only son\nWhen I was twelve my pops died too\nWhat a brother was supposed to do?\nThey sent me out West\nTo live with my aunt\nI guess they though it was the best\nBut there was no love there\nGrowin' with no moms\nI guess I was prepared to live in a vacuum\nThe bedroom, the kitchen, the hall and the bathroom\nI didn't leave home much, didn't like L.A\nDidn't have no friends to trust\nGot bused to a school\nBlacks and whites, I guess the shit was cool\nBut in highschool I changed\nDidn't wanna bust, didn't wanna play the game\nI walked to Crenshaw High, shit was fly\nI hooked up with a new crew\nSome brothers that seemed like they knew what the fuck to do\nYou might call it \"gang\" but we called it a set\nAnd it was our own thang\nThe whole school was down\nAnd one way or another everybody fucked around\nWhether hardcore or not\nYou wore the right color or your ass got shot\nThat's how I'm livin'...\n\nI did three years in and made close friends\nHavin' no love my homies became my only\nI was glad: the family I never had\nBut I grew up fast, got a girl on 10th grade pregnant\nNeedin' cash, I had to change my style\nSwitched from bangin' to hustlin'\nNo more goin' buckwild\nHad to get a cashflow\nBut my hustle was weak, it was a no go\nI joined the army, four years in that shit\nBe all fucked you can be\nCame back to the hood\nMy homies had done good\nHad elevated their game\nAbout 100 gees a lick, no mothafuckin' shame\nPassed for the jewels\nBaby sledgehammers with the tools\nI speak on this with hesitation\nEven though it passed the statue of limitations...\n\nI checked the bank\nBought a porsche and gear, earn high streetrank\nBut as I grew my whole crew fell through\nCops had us on the books as interstate crooks\nMurder robbery rape escape, the whole damn nine\nYou robbed a nigga blind\nI had too much juice, I cut my boosters loose\nI was in tread with the pimpgame\nTook on the Ice name\nBut the pimp game moved too slow\nEspecially for a nigga who was hooked on quick dough\nIn one night late I was in a carwreck\nAnd I was lucky to escape\nHospital for ten weeks, in bed almost dead\nAnd when I got well, I got caught in a cross\nAnd got locked in a jailcell\nThat's how I'm livin'...\n\nThey cut me loose\nAnd I had to change troops\nThis time they didn't catch me\nNext time they'll stretch me\nCause my time was gettin' short\nAll my homies was in court\nOr locked in a hole, this shit was gettin' old\nSo I changed my life\nPut down the gun and picked up the mic\nIt took ten years to get from there to here\nBut I still keep a gun, cops got me on the run\nAnd they hate me more now\nThan they ever did before\nMy homies came back from pen\nAnd we all worked together\nTrue friends but every once and while\nSome punk mistakes me as a chump\nAnd he gets in my face\nWrong mothafuckin' place\nAnd I ain't lyin', that's how you dyin'..."}}, {"title": "Home of the Bodybag", "album": "O.G.

house\nYeah, Geto Boys in the house\nYeah, Donald D's in the house\nYeah, Body count's in the house\nYeah, Zulu Nation's in the house\nYeah, Ice T's in the house, yeah\n\n[Verse One]\nYou go on and on and you don't stop\nGot sticky sneakers from the blood of a shot cop\nBailed in the club, I'm leavin' tracks on the white rug\nPunk tried to rif and he met double-aught slugs\nI ain't the nigga to step to\nOut catchin' bodies and the next one could be you\nQuick on the trigger, yo, I'm a gravedigger\nChop up a body and deep six 'em in the river\nA night-stalkin' psychopath\nAll cops hunt the black male in a ski-mask\nBut I'm too damn clever\nWill they ever catch me? Never!\nBecause I operate in and out of state\nMove at a quick rate\nAnd never hesitate to take a chump sucker down\nAnd my H-K it holds 80 rounds\nSo when you move be careful and don't play\nAnd watch for the ricochet\n\nSuicide, it's a suicide, yeah (x8)\n\n[Verse Two]\nSo shut up motherfuckers as I lay the ink\nWhen I'm in Detroit, niggas fight in mink\nWhen I'm in Chicago, motherfuckers get buck wild\nWhen I'm up in Oakland, niggas roll in huge pile\nIn Atlanta, niggas crash you doors\nWhen I'm in Philly, it's a sold out tour\nIn L.A., I max out real hard\nWhen I'm in New York, I build with the Gods\nSo don't try to deny me my proper juice\nE cuts the records and the yellow nigga gets loose\nNo static, just much respect\nTruck my Rolex when I cruise the projects\nA fly brother that's hard to figure\nI punch hoes and I smack up niggas\nCause I'm a pimp and a playa\nSometimes I bump hip-hop, the other times, Slayer\nYou don't like it well stay out of my fucking way\nDuck from the gunshot and watch for the ricochet\n\n\"Being cool, 'cause i'm ice\" (yeah!)\n\"Being cool, 'cause i'm ice, without a doubt\" (yeah!)\n\"Being cool, 'cause i'm ice\" (yeah!)\n\n\"the L.A. player\"\n\nSuicide, it's a suicide, yeah (x3)\n\nC'mon yeah (x7)\n\n[Verse Three]\nYo D., what's up?, suckers is popping lip\nGrab the H-K and the dum-dum clip and spread out\nI'm putting punk's heads out\nDoors is shut, there's no chance to get out\nI got the motherfuckas tied with bike locks\nRaise the auto-loader and let off the buckshot\n{*gunfire sound*} That's how I like to do work\n{*gunfire sound*} Got guts on my T-shirt\nMotherfuckers tried to play the Ice\nBecause I rhyme smooth and on TV act nice\nSoft, that's what you shouldn't have said\nNow I'm so mad I'm bustin veins in my forehead\nYou want to get off, come on let's rock\nBut have your safety off, and your shit cocked\nCause when I come to get that ass\nLeave your whole fuckin' block filled with hot brass\nSo punk, don't make me pop my trunk\nShow you my amps and my Mossberg pump\nCause when I pull it, most niggas run\nFool niggas stay and get hit by the ricochet\n\nSuicide, it's a suicide, yeah (x8)\n\n[Verse Four]\nNiggas wanna know about me and the \"L\", though\nWe squashed that shit with me and him about a year ago\nBut there's a new rule starting tonight\nDiss me on a record, see me, FIGHT!\nCause in the days, you used to battle on mics\n{*gunfire sound*} Now it's '91, I'm using gauges and flashlights\nEase back and don't give me no feedback\nYo, \"Ice cool out\", yo, fuck that\nI'm hot, I'm putting niggas in cots\nSome get knocked out, some just get shot\nWhere'd I get all the juice I use\nGotta posse full of brothers with nothing to lose\nSome just got out, some will never\nSome beat their cases cause their lawyers were clever\nI love' em all and they know that's true\nSo they won't blink while they doing a punk like you\nFreeze motherfucker\nGet on your knees, hands behind you back\nBow your heads, if you will please\nI'll swing my axe, watch the bodies fall\nWatch your head bounce off like volleyball\nSo all you motherfuckers down with the fly guy\nLook me in the face, if you're strong when you walk by\nAnd all you punk niggas talking shit\nStep to the side, bow your head like a bitch\nI don't play, you'll get hit by the ricochet\n\nYou'll get hit by the ricochet\nYou'll get hit by the ricochet\n\nYeah"}}, {"title": "I Must Stand", "album": "VI - Return of the Real", "year": null, "lyrics": "Nobody ever said life was gon' be easy\nBut damn..\n\n[ VERSE 1 ]\nJust a kid, moms died when I was seven\nPops died, eleven, what's up with heaven?\nIt's hell when you're an orphan at a early age\nThis impressionable stage, no love breeds rage\nIn the heart of a child who never knew his roots\nLooked up to pimps and to hustlers in the eel-skin boots\nParkin Caddies on the sidewalk, gangsta talk\nTruckin diamonds and gold\nRubberbands around the bankrolls\nFly girls to make your head spin\nSeemed they partied all night long\nI was like, \"Put me on\"\nBut they said, \"Little fellow, run and go play\nTake your butt to school or else you'll have to be like us one day\"\nI didn't understand, but I tried to get a job\nWhile all the players got the girls cause they'd hustle and rob\nI was like makin 'bout 1-50 a week\nAnd after taxes, you know what that is - lunch meat\n\nAnd I know I can be better than this\nI gotta get me a car, man\nI gotta get a girl\n\nI know I can do it out there, man\nI'm gonna go for it, man\nI gotta get some money\nWord\n\n[ VERSE 2 ]\nStreets of anger, trouble and crime\nI had it hard, had to sleep in my car sometime\nBut I never let another player see me down\nI kept my front up, my gear clean\nEven when checkin minor green\nBrothers knew my game was true\nSo I hooked up with the real crew\nThat knew excactly what to do\nBank jobs and jewels, quick to flex with tools\nPimpin hoes on the block\nCheckin cash non-stop\nCrack spots, armor with interior bars\nNo lie, I used to own 'bout 15 cars\nEvery piece Fila made\nDrape my women in suede\nPavet Piaget, Cesar's Palace holidays\nIt was on, crazy out of control\nWe made up the word 'ballin', that was how we rolled\nBut the FBI had a-whole-nother idea\nIt's called multiple indictments for hundreds of years\n\nWhat\nDaff is dead?\nCarter got 25 years?\nNah..\nSpike 35 to life?\nNah, don't tell me B.O.'s dead, man\nI don't wanna hear that, man\nI was just with him\n\n[ VERSE 3 ]\nThe game is vicious, no retirement, you die young\nListen to a fake, he might tell you to grab a gun\nI get phone calls from condemned row\nBrothers I ran with, brothers I really know\nThey tell me, \"Ice you got much love in the pen\nYou're the one that got away, don't wanna see you in\"\nThey tell me, \"Tell the little homies the deal\nDon't let em come up in this hellish habitat of shanks and steel\"\nI marched two million strong in D.C\nLookin eye to eye with brothers that I used to think below me\nDamn, my mind was twisted in my hustlin days\nBut God spared me, I got a baby son to raise\nAnd bein black ain't easy, prejudice is real\nBut health and liberty is all we need for us to build\nWe gotta come together, unseparated\nCheck yourself like I did, blackman, because we're all related", "image":

you're an orphan at a early age\nThis impressionable stage, no love breeds rage\nIn the heart of a child who never knew his roots\nLooked up to pimps and to hustlers in the eel-skin boots\nParkin Caddies on the sidewalk, gangsta talk\nTruckin diamonds and gold\nRubberbands around the bankrolls\nFly girls to make your head spin\nSeemed they partied all night long\nI was like, \"Put me on\"\nBut they said, \"Little fellow, run and go play\nTake your butt to school or else you'll have to be like us one day\"\nI didn't understand, but I tried to get a job\nWhile all the players got the girls cause they'd hustle and rob\nI was like makin 'bout 1-50 a week\nAnd after taxes, you know what that is - lunch meat\n\nAnd I know I can be better than this\nI gotta get me a car, man\nI gotta get a girl\n\nI know I can do it out there, man\nI'm gonna go for it, man\nI gotta get some money\nWord\n\n[ VERSE 2 ]\nStreets of anger, trouble and crime\nI had it hard, had to sleep in my car sometime\nBut I never let another player see me down\nI kept my front up, my gear clean\nEven when checkin minor green\nBrothers knew my game was true\nSo I hooked up with the real crew\nThat knew excactly what to do\nBank jobs and jewels, quick to flex with tools\nPimpin hoes on the block\nCheckin cash non-stop\nCrack spots, armor with interior bars\nNo lie, I used to own 'bout 15 cars\nEvery piece Fila made\nDrape my women in suede\nPavet Piaget, Cesar's Palace holidays\nIt was on, crazy out of control\nWe made up the word 'ballin', that was how we rolled\nBut the FBI had a-whole-nother idea\nIt's called multiple indictments for hundreds of years\n\nWhat\nDaff is dead?\nCarter got 25 years?\nNah..\nSpike 35 to life?\nNah, don't tell me B.O.'s dead, man\nI don't wanna hear that, man\nI was just with him\n\n[ VERSE 3 ]\nThe game is vicious, no retirement, you die young\nListen to a fake, he might tell you to grab a gun\nI get phone calls from condemned row\nBrothers I ran with, brothers I really know\nThey tell me, \"Ice you got much love in the pen\nYou're the one that got away, don't wanna see you in\"\nThey tell me, \"Tell the little homies the deal\nDon't let em come up in this hellish habitat of shanks and steel\"\nI marched two million strong in D.C\nLookin eye to eye with brothers that I used to think below me\nDamn, my mind was twisted in my hustlin days\nBut God spared me, I got a baby son to raise\nAnd bein black ain't easy, prejudice is real\nBut health and liberty is all we need for us to build\nWe gotta come together, unseparated\nCheck yourself like I did, blackman, because we're all related"}}, {"title": "My Baby", "album": "Gangsta Rap", "year": null, "lyrics": "* some girl repeats \"OOHH Baby, My Baby\" in the

they catch us out there, they'll bleed us\nShoot us, kill us, dump us in a dark ditch\nClean it up, call it a gang hit\nI gotta make my move, \u2018cause I'm a renegade\nI recognize when mind techniques are being played\nIt's a plot they use to keep down another\nHere comes another brainwashed brother...\n\n\"Yo man, it sounds like you're selling out to me, \u2018cause I'm from the ghetto; I lived in the ghetto all my life!\nWe ain't supposed to leave here! We're black! We're supposed to be poor!\"\n\nShut up!

Well, shit, they're all Black! We gotta keep 'em together, the same way we got those fuckin' Indians!\"\n\nThere'll never be any good schools in the hood\nThere'll never be any cops that are any good!\nThe hospital is a great place to go to die\nReal estate's cheap, let me tell ya why\nThe man's got a sure fire system:\nA economic prison!\n\nCHORUS\n\nI escaped from the killing fields!"}}, {"title": "My Word Is Bond", "album": "The Iceberg / Freedom of Speech...

Street\nBy the time I got there, it was way too late\nCame back uptown and decided to wait\nRan into her cous', and hung with him\nMet Billy, Joe, Bob, Frank, Chuck and Slim\nWent back to the crib to watch a VCR\nAnd then I had to pick up my father's car\nLooked around for my brother, to see where he went\nAnd then I had to pay my mother's rent\nI know y'all think I'm lyin', but listen, you're wrong\nLike I told you before, my word is bond\n\n[Interlude]\n[Ice-T] Lies man, you be late to the show\nHow you gon' make some money, man?\n[Donald] Money?, You talkin' about money?\n[Ice-T] Man, I

many houses, sometimes I forget\nI brought a yacht and a brand new lear jet\nI flew to Paris just for good meal\nThen to Rome, to sign a record deal\nOff to London, to kick with the Queen \"what Queen?\"\nBack to LA, I bought a football teem\nI just can't stop spendin' that green\nMy girl loves the water so I brought baby a submarine\nBut see, I left my house without my credit Cards\nI think I left my wallet in my other car\nIf you could loan me ten, I'd pay you back\nYo man, you're lookin' at me crazy, what's up with that?\nYou think I'm lyin' but man, you're wrong\nAs I told you before,

man\"\nShe said her father casted for the Cosby Show\nAnd she said: \"Bob, would you like to go?\"\nYou know, so I went with her, and we chilled\nGot her drunk off the Eight Ball, and we illed\nShe was stupid rich, so I bought myself an island\nCharged it to her Master charge, I be wildin'\nSo, after that I stepped and she was cryin'\nShe gave me mansion, yo, why should I be lyin'?\nYou got me frontin'?, well homeboys, you're wrong\nAs I told you before, my word is bond\n\n[Interlude]\n[Ice-T] lies\n[Bronx Style] Why, why it gotta be all that, why it gotta be all\n[Ice-T] look at Donald, he always be lyin' about shows\n[Posse] Oh, he, he be lyin'\n[Donald D] yo, I ain't be lyin'\n[Ice-T] Check him out\n\n[Verse 6: Donald D]\nYo Ice, I did a concert in the White House\nAnd after that me and Donald Trump hung out\nAnd then I knocked Vanity boots in a limo'\nI rejected Michael Jackson's demo\nSmacked Freddy Krueger and he didn't reply\nHit Mike Tyson in his eye\nSharks around me and didn't die\nDrank a case of Cisco and I didn't get high\nYou might think I'm lyin, but listen, you're wrong\nLike I told you before, my word is bond\n\n[Interlude]\n[Posse] You high right now, man\n[Nat] No, I'm not (Stop lying)\n[Ice-T] Let, let the man with the money get it right for you\n[Bronx Style] What money, man?(Stop lying)\n\n[Verse 7: Ice-T]\nYou think I'm lyin' but I'm tellin' the stone truth\nI have been player ever since my youth\nIn 1st grade I was knockin' kids out cold\nIn 2nd grade I was truckin' the large gold\nIn 3rd grade I was checkin' the youth bank\n4th grade puttin' Gas in Benz my tank\nBy the 12th I was gamblin' outrageous\nI drove through Desert and broke Los Vagus\nYou probably think I'm lyin' but brothers, you're wrong\nAs I told you before, my word

Up here in the ammo dump studios I got my\nNigga Aladdin, SLJ's in the motherfuckin place\nBehind the mixin boards\nWe about to do dis shit like this here!\n\nVerse 1:\n\nIt's goin down tonight in L.A\nBuckshot and uzis spray\nMicrophone blowa\nThe bitch checka\nThe ho wrecka\nIce motherfuckin T\nNigga step to me\nBut grab ya hoes quick\nCause the Syndicate's throwin that crazy dick\nPunk motherfuckers run up\nYou'll get done up\nWe'll have your ass gunned up\nBefore sun-up\nSo what's the color I'm raggin?\nBeen a millionare for years\nStill saggin\nLeft pocket's stuffed with a huge ass brick\n.380 in my right so it sags a little bit\nMore than the rest of my gear\nWhen I'm on tour\nI empty clips\nBust lips\nAnd break jaws\nCause I love to loc up\nSo punk motherfucker don't choke up\nWhen you're talkin to me\n\nChorus:\n\nIce, Ice motherfuckin T (x4)\n\nVerse 2:\n\nBush, Quayle and Clinton got a problem with me:\nThe motheruckin T\nI give less than a fuck about any of them\nOr their fuckin police friends\nThey'd like to take me out\nMake me a goner\nThey even tryin to sweat Time Warner\nWhy?\nFor tellin the truth to the youth\nThat a lot of motherfuckers are hot\nAnd want police shot?\nYou can't stop the shock (?)\nThe fires are out\nBut the coals are still hot\nI got juice to bring pain\nYou tryin to fuck with the Ice\nAre you insane?\nThis shit is bigger than me\nBe warned\nIt's the lull before the storm\nAnd every fuckin thing I write\nIs gonna be analyzed by somebody white\n\nChorus\n\nVerse 3:\n\nRun motherfucker, hide motherfucker, trip motherfucker, die motherfucker\nYou don't give love\nAnd you won't get loved\nYou don't push\nAnd you won't get shoved\nNo joke\nI ain't here to laugh\nI ain't here to cry\nBut every night of the week\nOne of my homies die\nEeny meeny mynie moe\nBlood's pourin out the naps of your afro\nIt could be you\nCould be you\nCould be you\nCould be your whole damn crew\nIt happens real quick\nScreechin tires\nNext thing you're hit\nYour body's cold\nYour body's hot\nYou feel your chest\nYou gasp for breath\nYou're shot\nAnd now your homies is trippin'\nLookin for a gat to put they clip in\nStreet crime-\nThat's the thing I bring, Ice T\nI rap easy, I sing\nThey call it controversy\nI call it truth with no mercy\nThe beats are phat Ammo Dump tracks\nThe kind that make speakers crack\nNot made for squares\nOr the weak punks\nThat made the bump trunks\nPress-\nGet the fuck out my fuckin face\nI ain't got no more time to waste\nA ho is a ho, a bitch is a bitch, a nigga is a nigga\nAnd that's it\nI'm through explainin the shit\nYou just makin me backtrack\nThe next duck reporter might get hit with a blackjack\nPlus\nEvery one of my true fans\nTotally understands\nA nigga like me\n\nChorus (x2)"}},

bullshittin, they said it's real as hell\nCan't explain the way I felt\nToo many years I seen my brothers die\nAnd I can't say that shit was really that fly\nBut I used to gangbang when I was younger\nSo it's really hard to tell a kid that he's goin under\nI never thought I lived to see us chill\nCrips and Bloods holdin hands, the shit is ill\nBut I love it, I can't help it\nToo much death on the streets, and we dealt it\nVan Ness Boys, The Hoovers, The 60s\nBounty Hunters, 8-Treys, all coolin out, gee\nI pray the shit'll never stop\nYou used to see the wrong colors, and the gats went pop-pop\nBut now the kids got a chance to live\nAnd the O.G.'s got something to give\nThat's love, black on black, that's how they made it\nAnd if any busters flip, they get faded\nL.A. is where I'm speakin of\nPeace to all the gangsters, cause I got a lotta love\n\n[ VERSE 2 ]\nI got a lotta love, cause you're all my brothers\nRed or blue, black's the color\nWe got a chance, so we can really sweat the real fools\nShow those muthafuckas the real tools\nCheck the enemy, it ain't the family\nNot 1-11, try L.A.P.D\nThey gotta understand, they beat on a blackman\nThere's gonna be drama, know what I'm sayin?\nAnd if we flip, let's all flip together\nCause I'm prepared, kid, for rough weather\nAnd we gotta realize, the boys on the east side\nYou call em Eses, I call em allies\nBecause the day that we all unite\nWatch the pigs get real polite\nPunk muthafuckas gotta learn quick\nThat we ain't takin no more shit\nL.A. is where I'm speakin of\nPeace to all the gangsters, cause I got a lotta love\n\n[ VERSE 3 ]\nCrenshaw Boulevard, Sunday afternoon\nFolks sittin on things, mad systems boom\nThe girls are lookin better\nThe gang truce is on, so you wear whatever\nAt Venice by the ocean\nRag-top Trey hits the three-wheel motion\nThere's gangsters all around\nStill crazy sets, but you just don't clown\nI pray L.A. can stay this way\nIt's the first summer I can really say\nI felt cool, we all chilled\nWent to the park, and nobody got killed\nNow if you got a problem, it's man on man\nYou don't need a gang to solve em\nI seen the greatest thing I seen in my life\nTwo brothers in a straight up fist fight\nNobody pulled a gat, nobody jumped in\nNobody pulled a knife, nobody got done in\nL.A. is where I'm speakin of\nPeace to my city, cause I got a lotta love\n\n[ VERSE 4 ]\nG-a-t-e-s, I hope you wear a vest\nEven after you're out the fuckin office\nCause we're on a totally different tip\nFuck that pig brutality shit\nThis unity is gettin to me\nEvery brother on the street is my homie\nI'm rollin through a hood that I never been\nAnd every brother steps to me as a friend\nI love it, I love it\nAnd nothin in my life will ever be above it\nWe wanna see our kids all grown up\nWe're tired of seein our hoods get blown up\nL.A. is a great place\nFly girls, dope cars, life at a fast pace\nBut gangbanging was killin it quick\nAnother child got hit - bullshit\nPop-pop-pop, 10 on a weekend\nWe was goin off to deep end\nBut now we got a chance, my friend\nTo mend, and make the colors blend\nLet's all go out on a picnic, kick shit\nAnd squash all the static\nLast year I lost about five homies\nThis shit is real to me\nL.A. is where I'm speakin of\nPeace to all the gangsters, cause I got a lotta love\n\nYo\nThis is goin out to all the gangbangers\nAll over South Central\nWatts\nInglewood\nAll over L.A., basically\nEast L.A\nYouknowmsayin?\nIt's basically goin down\nPeace to all the Crips and the Bloods\nVan Ness Boys\nHoovers\nRollin 60s\n83's\nBounty Hunters\nYeah\nAnd the Jungle\nThis is goin out to all the brothers over there in Watts\nYou know what I'm sayin?\nThrowin it up\nGrape Street\nNutty Blocc\nFront Hood\nAnd all them niggas out there in Compton\nRollin 30s\nHarlem\nAh yeah\nPueblos\nNickerson G's\nPeace\nInglewood Family\n18th Street\nSouth Loc\nAnd all the Ese homeboys\nAll the

em they was bullshittin, they said it's real as hell\nCan't explain the way I felt\nToo many years I seen my brothers die\nAnd I can't say that shit was really that fly\nBut I used to gangbang when I was younger\nSo it's really hard to tell a kid that he's goin under\nI never thought I lived to see us chill\nCrips and Bloods holdin hands, the shit is ill\nBut I love it, I can't help it\nToo much death on the streets, and we dealt it\nVan Ness Boys, The Hoovers, The 60s\nBounty Hunters, 8-Treys, all coolin out, gee\nI pray the shit'll never stop\nYou used to see the wrong colors, and the gats went pop-pop\nBut now the kids got a chance to live\nAnd the O.G.'s got something to give\nThat's love, black on black, that's how they made it\nAnd if any busters flip, they get faded\nL.A. is where I'm speakin of\nPeace to all the gangsters, cause I got a lotta love\n\n[ VERSE 2 ]\nI got a lotta love, cause you're all my brothers\nRed or blue, black's the color\nWe got a chance, so we can really sweat the real fools\nShow those muthafuckas the real tools\nCheck the enemy, it ain't the family\nNot 1-11, try L.A.P.D\nThey gotta understand, they beat on a blackman\nThere's gonna be drama, know what I'm sayin?\nAnd if we flip, let's all flip together\nCause I'm prepared, kid, for rough weather\nAnd we gotta realize, the boys on the east side\nYou call em Eses, I call em allies\nBecause the day that we all unite\nWatch the pigs get real polite\nPunk muthafuckas gotta learn quick\nThat we ain't takin no more shit\nL.A. is where I'm speakin of\nPeace to all the gangsters, cause I got a lotta love\n\n[ VERSE 3 ]\nCrenshaw Boulevard, Sunday afternoon\nFolks sittin on things, mad systems boom\nThe girls are lookin better\nThe gang truce is on, so you wear whatever\nAt Venice by the ocean\nRag-top Trey hits the three-wheel motion\nThere's gangsters all around\nStill crazy sets, but you just don't clown\nI pray L.A. can stay this way\nIt's the first summer I can really say\nI felt cool, we all chilled\nWent to the park, and nobody got killed\nNow if you got a problem, it's man on man\nYou don't need a gang to solve em\nI seen the greatest thing I seen in my life\nTwo brothers in a straight up fist fight\nNobody pulled a gat, nobody jumped in\nNobody pulled a knife, nobody got done in\nL.A. is where I'm speakin of\nPeace to my city, cause I got a lotta love\n\n[ VERSE 4 ]\nG-a-t-e-s, I hope you wear a vest\nEven after you're out the fuckin office\nCause we're on a totally different tip\nFuck that pig brutality shit\nThis unity is gettin to me\nEvery brother on the street is my homie\nI'm rollin through a hood that I never been\nAnd every brother steps to me as a friend\nI love it, I love it\nAnd nothin in my life will ever be above it\nWe wanna see our kids all grown up\nWe're tired of seein our hoods get blown up\nL.A. is a great place\nFly girls, dope cars, life at a fast pace\nBut gangbanging was killin it quick\nAnother child got hit - bullshit\nPop-pop-pop, 10 on a weekend\nWe was goin off to deep end\nBut now we got a chance, my friend\nTo mend, and make the colors blend\nLet's all go out on a picnic, kick shit\nAnd squash all the static\nLast year I lost about five homies\nThis shit is real to me\nL.A. is where I'm speakin of\nPeace to all the gangsters, cause I got a lotta love\n\nYo\nThis is goin out to all the gangbangers\nAll over South Central\nWatts\nInglewood\nAll over L.A., basically\nEast L.A\nYouknowmsayin?\nIt's basically goin down\nPeace to all the Crips and the Bloods\nVan Ness Boys\nHoovers\nRollin 60s\n83's\nBounty Hunters\nYeah\nAnd the Jungle\nThis is goin out to all the brothers over there in Watts\nYou know what I'm sayin?\nThrowin it up\nGrape Street\nNutty Blocc\nFront Hood\nAnd all them niggas out there in Compton\nRollin 30s\nHarlem\nAh yeah\nPueblos\nNickerson G's\nPeace\nInglewood Family\n18th Street\nSouth Loc\nAnd all the Ese homeboys\nAll the different sets\nEvery set, Crip, Blood\nWhat doesn't matter to me\nCause I gotta love\nYou know what I'm sayin?\nHope the truce never ends\nYouknowsayin?\nWe can do this"}}, {"title": "409", "album":

Yeah you could call me that\nInsane? You're on the right track\nBut turn the sounds up\nSo I can stay amped\nDo another crew and break camp\nThe only way I sleep is in a cold sweat\nYou think I'm crazy?\nYou ain't see shit yet\nCause I live to kill and kill for fun\nThe microphone it goes off\nLike a handgun\nIt's goin' down now\nGrab your girl hops\nNo excuses when the bodies\nBegin to drop\nLook in my face fool\nIt look like I'm play'n\nDon't become another\nVictim of mic slayin'\n\nWhat's up?\nYou want your feet in some concrete?\nI got some brothers\nThat'll do you for gold teeth\nBut most the time I move, I move alone\nTake a bat\nBreak your motherfuckin' dome\nShoot you dead in the face\nWith a sawed off\nOne hundred ten degrees\nIce don't get soft\nCause I'm hard as they come\nI come correct\nYou can't handle the vandal hit eject\nIf not you better get\nOut my face sucka\nOr else you better be\nA good bullet ducker\nCause I'm a rip shop\nTell that ass drop\nFive o Ice, yo fuck a damn cop!\nCause I move hard and cold\nWith a gangster stroll\nFive thousand dollar suits\nAnd fly gold\nRolex, you can't fit no more\nDiamonds on it\nPinky ring, worth a house\nIf I decide to pawn it\nWhat's up now punk?\nYo start to choke up?\nYou try to move on the Ice\nYou'll get broke up!\n\nMidnight, time for a homicide\nShowtime, somebody's gonna die\nE hits the switch\nAnd thouands of volts connect\nWith the weapon that's in my fist\nI see a sucka in the third row\nTry'n to riff\nA paragraph and a half he's stiff\nI start bustin' off barrages ear high\nMothers grab for their children\nTears fly\nI'm like a psycho\nWhen the microphone's on\nSpeakers blown, mind gone\nI can't be touched\nOnce my lyrics begin to fly\nSimple stage radiation\nCould make ya die\nYa got a problem nigga?\nYou think your rep's bigger?\nHold your head right there\nWhile I squeeze the trigger\nCause I'm a crazy motherfucker\nThat's no joke\nMy favorite smell is\nThe aroma of gunsmoke\nI'm bustin' off another\nLyrical nightmare\nParents hate the Ice!\nYou think that I care?\nWell I don't give a fuck\nCause I rhyme tough\nDrop science, still bust the ill stuff\nSo now it's time for crime\nAnd the rhyme is mine\nTrack the movement\nHide from the punchline\nI rhyme with quickness\nMicrophone fitness\nThe assassinator\nStay off the shit list", "image":

"Brainstorm microphone napalm\nThis is it, words from a timebomb\nAttack speed, fast as an F15\nRaise the heat, light the gasoline\nOverload, it might cause a blackout\nDead end\nThere's no chance to back out\nHit the tripwire\nDuck from the gunfire\nBroken glass, screechin' car tires, bodies hit the deck\nAs I commence to wreck\nEject another clip and drip sweat\nFace of danger, increasin' anger\nPoint blank\nI smoke another stranger\nGrip the mic tight\nI see the brake lights\nHit the back door\nI lay down cross the floor\nE's on the wheels\nHe makes the rubber squeal\nBlood's on my gear\nFrom caps I've peeled\nAbout a block away I sit up\nLook back\nIt wasn't nothin' but a\nMicrophone contract!\n\nDressed in black I stalk my prey\nParabellum in a leather attache\nLow tones I speak, I speak to few\nJust give me the money\nAnd who the fuck to do\nFour blocks away my aim's clean\nNight scope on a silence carbine\nPlace my crosshairs on my vic's eye\nSqueeze the trigger\nWatch the brains fly\nViolent? Yeah you could call me that\nInsane? You're on the right track\nBut turn the sounds up\nSo I can stay amped\nDo another crew and break camp\nThe only way I sleep is in a cold sweat\nYou think I'm crazy?\nYou ain't see shit yet\nCause I live to kill and kill for fun\nThe microphone it goes off\nLike a handgun\nIt's goin' down now\nGrab your girl hops\nNo excuses when the bodies\nBegin to drop\nLook in my face fool\nIt look like I'm play'n\nDon't become another\nVictim of mic slayin'\n\nWhat's up?\nYou want your feet in some concrete?\nI got some brothers\nThat'll do you for gold teeth\nBut most the time I move, I move alone\nTake a bat\nBreak your motherfuckin' dome\nShoot you dead in the face\nWith a sawed off\nOne hundred ten degrees\nIce don't get soft\nCause I'm hard as they come\nI come correct\nYou can't handle the vandal hit eject\nIf not you better get\nOut my face sucka\nOr else you better be\nA good bullet ducker\nCause I'm a rip shop\nTell that ass drop\nFive o Ice, yo fuck a damn cop!\nCause I move hard and cold\nWith a gangster stroll\nFive thousand dollar suits\nAnd fly gold\nRolex, you can't fit no more\nDiamonds on it\nPinky ring, worth a house\nIf I decide to pawn it\nWhat's up now punk?\nYo start to choke up?\nYou try to move on the Ice\nYou'll get broke up!\n\nMidnight, time for a homicide\nShowtime, somebody's gonna die\nE hits the switch\nAnd thouands of volts connect\nWith the weapon that's in my fist\nI see a sucka in the third row\nTry'n to riff\nA paragraph and a half he's stiff\nI start bustin' off barrages ear high\nMothers grab for their children\nTears fly\nI'm like a psycho\nWhen the microphone's on\nSpeakers blown, mind gone\nI can't be touched\nOnce my lyrics begin to fly\nSimple stage radiation\nCould make ya die\nYa got a problem nigga?\nYou think your rep's bigger?\nHold your head right there\nWhile I squeeze the trigger\nCause I'm a crazy motherfucker\nThat's no joke\nMy favorite smell is\nThe aroma of gunsmoke\nI'm bustin' off another\nLyrical nightmare\nParents hate the Ice!\nYou think that I care?\nWell I don't give a fuck\nCause I rhyme tough\nDrop science, still bust the ill stuff\nSo now it's time for crime\nAnd the rhyme is mine\nTrack the movement\nHide from the punchline\nI rhyme with quickness\nMicrophone fitness\nThe assassinator\nStay off the shit list"}}, {"title": "Funky Gripsta", "album": "Home Invasion", "year":

"(Intro: Ice-T)\nYeah, Ice-T nigga, Seventh Deadly Sin\nIt's all about that hardcore mind\nGot my nigga Radzay, my nigga Bazaro, my girl Gripsta in the house\nWe gonna do it for all the hardcore niggas out there like this...\n\n(Radzay)\nA hard hit makes a soft ass, that's what they told me huh!\nI'm totally gone, I'm in another zone nigga put me on this\nWe layin' stick, my lyrics is heat\nHavin' visions of ritual mirrors inside my sleep - nigga peep\nI remember watchin' the news, dead people in jimmy bag\nI got a Nine nigga get me mad\nAnd watch me throw up razorblades and get to trippin'\nI'm cats and crippin', lickin' is civil like Jack the Ripper\nI'm on a mission drippin'-a-fog\nAn when it sees a million motherfuckers deceased\nSome of police are brutal hog, I'm actor-baitin'\nNo hesitation to slice a motherfucker in thirty places\nFuck a case - ain't leavin' traces here to Redder-Dip\nI'm aimin' a - automatic find a bitch I'm hangin' up\nProtainin' up, boss strangler, better save my mother\nFlat packs will end as brothers - the bloody covers\nBloody gloves like Yo-J, AK's my brainwaves\nI'll strung a nigga all day to my dear play you won't be comin' back\nI put that on my dear pops when I blast a fierce drop\nMy bloody mask revealin' Jason it's non-stop\nThe cemetary is what you facin'\nMy steel shot is smokin' like chainsaws, brains call\nRecommend that you get your homies and watch your motherfuckin' game fall\n\n(Chorus)\nI only like my shit hardcore\n(Radzay, South Central L.A. nigga)\nI only like my shit hardcore\nI only like my shit hardcore\nI only like my shit hardcore\n\n(Ice-T)\nPrepare for the night that you never wanted\nThese streets is taunted, blacked out impala with the big rims on it\nHit'cha corner with the lights out, bitch it's on\nDuck down wit'cha kids, you know what you did\nMotherfuck what your niggas say, watch for the ricochet\nIt's gonna be hard to hear much, once my trigger spray\nThat's neither here nor there, just beware\nCause when I bust off my gat flings like a roll flair\nYou now listenin' to - the most hated and most loved at the same time cuz\nIce nigga what the fuck you wanna do about a T\nMost'cha bitch niggas can't fuck with me\nCause your chin-chalked talk I can see through\nLike you're rollin' in a phat V-12\nBulllshit - pull quick and have your shit cocked or dropped\nKeep a spare clip cause sometimes the shots don't stop\nIt's motherfuckin' game to rap about, shits' for real\nDouble action, ain't gotta cock back no more\nGot you bitch-ass niggas sweatin' like Taibo\nRather lookin', in my face, I'm just checkin' my flow\nSo, I advise you to keep it in the studio\nYour attittude, you don't wanna meet me dude\nMy crews' like a fuckin' wild bunch of escaped beasts\nLike scientists, cross cells of apes and G's\nAll the war - get you battle gear, black fatigues\nYou talk shit, your crews' catch a casualty, uh!\n\n(Chorus)\nI only like my shit hardcore\n(Ice-T nigga, what?)\nI only like my shit hardcore\nI only like my shit hardcore\nI only like my shit hardcore\n\n(Bazaro)\nAiyyo my style be official, I bust like a pistol\nCriminal - the issue, mad shit the nigga been through\nPeep now, system, handcuffs nigga listen\nWord up, robbin' white boys to buy blunts\nThe representative - GorTek Assassin thought to be a stallion\nYo I be splashin' Street Wars\nThe hardcore Ambassador in a black four door Akaror, I attach yours\nThe Marquise piece, gold teeth and medallion\nHeads I be sappin' like the grams I be baggin'\nFightin' women, cut throat and tree smokin'\nViolatin', infiltratin', blunt bakin'\nBlock regulatin', the cake, bake, a brick flippin'\nGreen expedition thicker to body stickin'\nBazaro, yo I got the hardcore flow\nI drop to put a rock from the Bronx y'all know\n\n(Chorus)\nI only like my shit hardcore\n(Bazaro, Boogie down Bronx baby)\nI only like my shit hardcore\n\n(Grip)\nOn the mic, Grip be flexin'\nWho's next to wreck when I mic check, mic check\nI'm checkin' any verbal an' steppin'\nWhat the fuck nigga duck you ain't fuckin' with this\nGet touched cause I lust to bust when I clutch\nWith the quickness, killin' lyricist when I spit this\nWho's next on my hitlist when I rip this\nLyrically I'm material, the Rap War General\nDroppin' hoes quicker than a syllable, yeah you killable\nYour style, unfillable, wishin' my shit was stillable\nI eel for the fuck of it, queen you know I'm lovin' it\nDick, never suckin' it unless I see a buck in it\nYou need the whip, cluck it kid, I'm furious\nLeavin' your crew delirious so you don't take it serious\nI'm guessin' you was serious about the West, none test\nI got the rep for my niggas on the shaw\nGot the ball, fuck the law and yep I wet 'em out\nAs I proceed to spread 'em out and dead 'em out\nSpray 'em out, lay 'em out\nAin't no surprise, come see me with four eyes\nYoung Grip I'm a prize, prepare for you demise\nRecognize I put a hole in the local aforenor\nNigga this is Coroner\n\n(Ice-T)\nGripsta, Oakland, California\n\nI only like my shit hardcore..."}}, {"title": "Ain't a Damn Thing Changed",

Naugh man I'm not trying to hear that\nYo listen man, it was your boy man - He talks a lot\nI can't believe this shit man, I grew up with this nigga man\nThis motherfucker, I would've died for this nigga man\nAnd this nigga set me up?\n\nYou're now fucking with your last nigga\nQuick to blast nigga\nGauge Masturbator\nChest Plate disintegrator, rider\nI never wore no mask, wacked the witness - vestless\nI'll put you on the graveyard's guest list\nICE - cause I lack all emotions, I'm heartless\nThat's why I can't figure for the life of me\nYou'd want to start this\nMy crew is bottomless\nStreet Lobotomists\nGun slingers\nGlock cocked and diamond ringers\nHustlers\nMy nigga got shot but still alive\nHe took a full clip from another player's 25\nAnd he said he's rolling with me, if you're coming\nI told him, stay home, rest up, I got enough gunning\nHomiciders\nBallin' rag Rolls riders\nBlood letters\nMoney getters\nLife betters\nThe last thing I heard you say you said I was a dead man, bitch\nI'll put you right into gun point, you snitch\nNow I know your plans are rolling on me, late when I sleep\nWhy don't we do this man to man?

You know my steelo\nGot love with the illest of blacks and amigos\nYour jealousy is outta hand, I can't fuck wit'cha\nAnd all your so-called down niggas, say good luck to ya\nThey know you're off the

obstetricians show your crews anhiliation\nPredicted, Brains get evicted, Fuckin with me kid\nBullets lift your lid\nAnd watch your weak kool aid heart run down the drain\nI got the Method Man who came to bring the pain\nLet you know quick, niggas suck dick if you trip\nUsed to be my homie, now you just a punk ho bitch\nFrustration leads to aggravation and dismay\nNow you're player haten, but that's the wrong game to play\nI light your block up, kidnap your moms - snatch your woman\nYou beg for me to stop, but I'll just keep coming\nYou're fucking with the illest fool in Southern

Naugh man I'm not trying to hear that\nYo listen man, it was your boy man - He talks a lot\nI can't believe this shit man, I grew up with this nigga man\nThis motherfucker, I would've died for this nigga man\nAnd this nigga set me up?\n\nYou're now fucking with your last nigga\nQuick to blast nigga\nGauge Masturbator\nChest Plate disintegrator, rider\nI never wore no mask, wacked the witness - vestless\nI'll put you on the graveyard's guest list\nICE - cause I lack all emotions, I'm heartless\nThat's why I can't figure for the life of me\nYou'd want to start this\nMy crew is bottomless\nStreet Lobotomists\nGun slingers\nGlock cocked and diamond ringers\nHustlers\nMy nigga got shot but still alive\nHe took a full clip from another player's 25\nAnd he said he's rolling with me, if you're coming\nI told him, stay home, rest up, I got enough gunning\nHomiciders\nBallin' rag Rolls riders\nBlood letters\nMoney getters\nLife betters\nThe last thing I heard you say you said I was a dead man, bitch\nI'll put you right into gun point, you snitch\nNow I know your plans are rolling on me, late when I sleep\nWhy don't we do this man to man? Let them bitch niggas creep\nI still remember in the days when we was friends chillin\nNow it seems you going to have to be my next killin\n\nChorus x2:\nYou wanna go to war, nigga tell me why?\nPunk niggas talk shit, bitch niggas die\nI never backed down and it ain't no time to start\nLet's take it to the streets and I'm a check your heart\n\nYou must be death wishing, what's up?

four gold albums, so what you're telling me?\nPower was two, Iceberg was three\nThis one here shipped five hundred G\nNow when I roll, I roll stupid deep\nBenz's, Bemers, and booming Jeeps\nI'm always strapped, cause my money I keep\nYou move on the Ice, and you're going to sleep\nBut when you see me walking down the street\nYou say, \"What's up Ice?\" -- what would I say, \"Peace!\"\nYou give me a dap, I give you one back\nCause I ain't souped, so forget about that\nWe might take a picture or sign an autograph\nKick a little flavor to have some fun and laugh\nBut step to me wrong, you might get shot\nAnd wind up looking out a ziplock!!!\n\n[Outro]\nYEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/705092b6df1c9ba34be13d3bca83d107.926x926x1.jpg", "artist": "Ice-T", "raw":

By now, the war has probably started and a whole bunch of people have probably died out there in the desert over some bullshit. Theres a war goin' on right now in my neighborhood, but I can't really determine which one is worse. I think the one that we are all fightin' is fucked up, and that's the war inside our brains, you know? But, uh, I feel bad about all the brothers and sisters gettin' pulled right out of their neighborhoods, all the cities, and small towns in America that go over there and fight for that bullshit That most of them don't really have anything to do with, so I gotta send peace out to em. Also peace out to all my homies in jail, brothers that are dead locked up right here on earth. Talkin' about the brothers in Soledad, San Quentin, all the way up to Pelicans' Bay, Tracy, Chino, and all my homeboys out there in the east coast lockdown facilities. I'm talkin' about Clinton, Rikers, Joliet, you know every prison in the whole fuckin' world man, that's like, you know, all bullshit, you know? They say slavery has been abolished except for the convicted felon; y'all need to think about that. That lets you know what the fuckin' Constitution is really about, you know? A lot of my homeboys have been locked down my whole entire career, and thats some bullshit.

This album was completed on January 15th 1991. By now, the war has probably started and a whole bunch of people have probably died out there in the desert over some bullshit. Theres a war goin' on right now in my neighborhood, but I can't really determine which one is worse. I think the one that we are all fightin' is fucked up, and that's the war inside our brains, you know? But, uh, I feel bad about all the brothers and sisters gettin' pulled right out of their neighborhoods, all the cities, and small towns in America that go over there and fight for that bullshit That most of them don't really have anything to do with, so I gotta send peace out to em. Also peace out to all my homies in jail, brothers that are dead locked up right here on earth. Talkin' about the brothers in Soledad, San Quentin, all the way up to Pelicans' Bay, Tracy, Chino, and all my homeboys out there in the east coast lockdown facilities. I'm talkin' about Clinton, Rikers, Joliet, you know every prison in the whole fuckin' world man, that's like, you know, all bullshit, you know? They say slavery has been abolished except for the convicted felon; y'all need to think about that. That lets you know what the fuckin' Constitution is really about, you know? A lot of my homeboys have been locked down my whole entire career, and thats some bullshit. So for them from the Rhyme Syndicate and Ice-T, I'd like to send this special shout out: Fuck the police, fuck the FBI, fuck the DEA, fuck the CIA, fuck Tipper Gore, Bush and his cripple bitch!

Yo that shit's a joke\nHit record on my dope remote\nI heard my phone ringin, I wonder who could it be\nIt was the E, the V, yes the I-L E\nHe said, \"We got static - word, I just got out\nPunks tried to move at the club and we shot out\nBullets everywhere,\" Okay what's the prob?\n\"Ink got popped, he's dead as a doorknob.\"\nYou bullshittin! \"I ain't fuckin around\nThe posse's rollin tonight, nigga are you down?\"\nI grabbed my AK, my 16, and my baby Mac\nStrapped on my vest, and threw the 9 in the small of my back\nI said - Chill, don't let nobody move without me\nSay you know where they are?\nHe said, \"I know where they be\"\nLet's peel their caps back\nLet's peel their caps back\n\nTwelve o'clock midnight, posse was airtight\nTwenty-five cars, under the streetlights\nSome people talked, while others cried\nInk was a brother, who shouldn't have died\nThen the silence broke, Ice what's it gonna be?\n38 hard brothers stood and stared at me\nThere were only two words that I had to say\nP-A-Y, B-A-C-K\nThe car's loaded with a silence that could wake the dead\nPistols clipped as the chambers loaded full of lead\nEveryone in the crew knew what I said\nWould mean by morning, somebody else soon would be dead\nLet's peel their caps back\n\nThe cars at the corner like a long black snake\nNight prowlin' for a life to take\nYa see down in the ghetto it's an eye for an eye\nThat's the answer to the question why\nIn my throat, there's a lump, then I swallow it, I ain't no chump\nFace of Death, then I cocked my pump\nI'm a nigga on the trigger, madder than a pitbull\nJust layin for a reason to pull\nOn you, any duck motherfucker that gets in my way\nI'm insane, and my homeboy's death made me this way\nBut then we spot him, Evil E shot him\nDead in the face, made sure that he got him\nOthers ran, but no mercy to the posse's wrath\nAutomatic Uzi motherfuckin bloodbath\nLet's peel their caps back\nLet's peel their caps back\nLet's peel their caps back\n\nThen all of a sudden, a bullet came through my eye\nMy dome exploded and I felt my other brothers die\nI drank my blood as I fell like shit into the street\nMy corpse stunk like a burnt out rotten piece of meat\nTen brothers died in this stupid homicidal binge\nCause whenever someone dies, nobody wins\nBut this drama, you'll never hear a word of\nCause all the paper's gonna read is a gang murder\nGang murder", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8130dc496c2cedd8004532bb340c7c91.800x800x1.jpg", "artist": "Ice-T", "raw": {"annotation_count": 2, "api_path": "/songs/23105",

Huh, don't mean nuttin\nThey call that shit a crime? Yo that shit's a joke\nHit record on my dope remote\nI heard my phone ringin, I wonder who could it be\nIt was the E, the V, yes the I-L E\nHe said, \"We got static - word, I just got out\nPunks tried to move at the club and we shot out\nBullets everywhere,\" Okay what's the prob?\n\"Ink got popped, he's dead as a doorknob.\"\nYou bullshittin! \"I ain't fuckin around\nThe posse's rollin tonight, nigga are you down?\"\nI grabbed my AK, my 16, and my baby Mac\nStrapped on my vest, and threw the 9 in the small of my back\nI said - Chill, don't let nobody move without me\nSay you know where they are?\nHe said, \"I know where they be\"\nLet's peel their caps back\nLet's peel their caps back\n\nTwelve o'clock midnight, posse was airtight\nTwenty-five cars, under the streetlights\nSome people talked, while others cried\nInk was a brother, who shouldn't have died\nThen the silence broke, Ice what's it gonna be?\n38 hard brothers stood and stared at me\nThere were only two words that I had to say\nP-A-Y, B-A-C-K\nThe car's loaded with a silence that could wake the dead\nPistols clipped as the chambers loaded full of lead\nEveryone in the crew knew what I said\nWould mean by morning, somebody else soon would be dead\nLet's peel their caps back\n\nThe cars at the corner like a long black snake\nNight prowlin' for a life to take\nYa see down in the ghetto it's an eye for an eye\nThat's the answer to the question why\nIn my throat, there's a lump, then I swallow it, I ain't no chump\nFace of Death, then I cocked my pump\nI'm a nigga on the trigger, madder than a pitbull\nJust layin for a reason to pull\nOn you, any duck motherfucker that gets in my way\nI'm insane, and my homeboy's death made me this way\nBut then we spot him, Evil E shot him\nDead in the face, made sure that he got him\nOthers ran, but no mercy to the posse's wrath\nAutomatic Uzi motherfuckin bloodbath\nLet's peel their caps back\nLet's peel their caps back\nLet's peel their caps back\n\nThen all of a sudden, a bullet came through my eye\nMy dome exploded and I felt my other brothers die\nI drank my blood as I fell like shit into the street\nMy corpse stunk like a burnt out rotten piece of meat\nTen brothers died in this stupid homicidal binge\nCause whenever someone dies, nobody wins\nBut this drama, you'll never hear a word of\nCause all the paper's gonna read is a gang murder\nGang murder"}}, {"title": "Lifestyles of the Rich and Infamous", "album": "O.G.

"It's eight a.m. I roll out my silk sheets\nGet fly crash the limo back seats\nLookin' in the faces\nOf some ladies that I never met\nOn the interview tip, no sweat\nThey ask me questions\nI throw the words back\nThey say they write facts\nI know that's bull crap\nThey're kickin' drama\nBut then drama's my middle name\nThat's the price ya pay for big fame\nThe cellular phone rings\nDon't wanta pick it up\nBut it's my J-O-B I gotta kick it up\nAnother damn reporter\nOn the line with a word quiz\nI gotta show cause I'm livin' in showbiz\nOut the limo, to the plane\nIn the pourin' rain\nI hate flyin'\nBut there's no time for slow trains\nAnother show to do\nI gotta catch my crew\nThey left last night\nIn the bus around two\nThe plane's a small one\nNo fun at all\nBouncin' round the air\nLike a tennis ball\nWhen it touches down\nI wanna kiss the ground\nBut it's time to wreck a new town\nGet to the arena, meet up with the crew\nThey tell me all the speakers blew\nThe cordless don't work\nSound man's a jerk\nSomebody's gonna get hurt\nI'm crazy mad\nBut my fans want autographs\nI turn my angry frowns\nInto fake laughs\nI can't be rude\nCause they wouldn't understand\nI ain't human no more, I'm a superman\n\nCHORUS\nYou can try\nBut you'll never understand this\nYou can try\nBut you'll never understand this\nYou can try\nBut you'll never understand this\nThe lifestyles of the rich and infamous\n\nFour hours 'til show time oh well\nI might as well check in the hotel\nGet a little rest before it's time for us to play\nTen brothers standin' in the hallway\nAll with demo tapes\nThey need the hook up\nThey heard that I was\nThe one to look up\nI can't ditch 'em\nCause they already saw me\nI'll put my head down\nMaybe they'll ignore me\nNo chance \"Ice what's goin' on?\"\nI listened to twenty-five songs\nAnd after that the brothers still wouldn't leave\nThey started lookin' at my T.V\nI was gonna break down if they didn't jet soon\nSnuck across the hall and crashed in E's room\nBut then this freak came in, thought I was E\nStraddled her legs across me\nRipped off her blouse\nPushed her breast against my face\nStarted gyrating her waist. Sounds fly\nLike a hype sex thriller?\nBut see, she looked like Godzilla\nPushed her off me\nHome girl hit the floor\nThis is what it's like on tour\nI hit the hallway it was crawlin' thick\n\"Could weez take ya picture real quick?\"\nJumped into a pose\nThat I used a million times before\nTook pictures\nWith the whole damn floor\nI couldn't say no, not to my fans\nYou see they wouldn't understand\n\nCHORUS\n\nNow it's show time, time to flow time\nEvil lost the records\nBut we still gotta go time\nThe house is packed\nEverybody's on their feet\nSo I say, \"Throw on Rakim's beat.\"\nE hits the fader and the crowd is lit\nI start bustin' off some new shit\nThe stage is so smokey\nThat I almost fall off, I start inhalin' it\nI'm tryin' not to cough\nI'm catchin' problems from every angle\nThe mic cords are tangled\nI try to flow smooth\nBut my words are mangled\nDamn near slipped and broke my ankle\nIf that ain't enough\nThe police are hawkin'\nListenin' real close\nTo the words I'm talkin'\nThey wanna put a brother like me\nIn the back seat\nJust because I curse the beat\nThey wanna tap my phone\nWanna keep my crib bugged\nCall all my homies\nFelons and street thugs\nYou might say\nI think this lifestyle sucks?\nI wouldn't trade it for a million bucks\nAlthough it's all\nNot glamour and gleam\nIt's still my dream\n\nCHORUS"}}, {"title": "The Coldest Rap", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Ice-T]\nSome people claim that I'm born to play\nCause I'm your Ice-T on a sunny day\nI make the goers come, the leavers stay\nI make the lovers kiss and the workers play\nI make the runners walk, the quiet talk\nI bust so viciously, I make the blind man see\nI'm the ladies' cream, the virgins' wet dream\nI got that kind of movement that makes the young girls fiend\nI'm tired of these DJs going around\nTalking about how they go down to town\nCause I'm the best Rapper that you have found\nSo all you lovely ladies, let's party down\nTake all your rapping records, throw them in the trash\nIce-T is the only brother that you got to blast\nHook up the stereo, turn up the watts\nWe're gonna rock 'til the niggas call up the cops\nWe rock rock y'all with no fear, and\nIf you don't dig it turn off your ears\nWe rock rock y'all and keep on, and\nIf you don't dig it take your damn self home\nCause I'm a player, the best alive\nI prefer fast money to a Nine-to-Five\nFrom the womb to the tomb, I run my game\nCause I'm cold as ice, and I show no shame\n\n[Break: Sound of cold wind blowing]\n\n[Verse 2: Ice-T]\nWell I'm Ice-T, I'm terribly bad\nI'm here to knock out the windows and blow up the pad\nI may be small but I'm willing to say\nI jam this party in one hell of a way\nThe powers I got are hard to find\nI'll be breaking women's hearts while I'm blowing their minds\nThey be giving me money, and buying me things\nBut I spend their cash and pawn their rings\nIf they treat me right, I'm willing to show\nThe coolest young brother they'll ever know\nBut if they do me wrong, I hate to say\nI'll never teach them how to rock this way\nCause back in the thirties when times was hard\nI had a sawed-off shotgun, a marked deck of cards\nA turned up collar, a turned up hat\nA .38 hustle and I stole that\nI walked in the party, there were women for days\nAnd I started dancing one hell of a way\nI was dancing so hard, couldn't no one compete\nI turned out the party with my Ice-cold feet\nCause I'm a player, that's all I know\nOn a summer day, I play in the snow\nFrom the womb to the tomb, I run my game\nCause I'm cold as ice, and I show no shame\n\n[Break: Sound of cold wind blowing]\n\n[Verse 3: Ice-T]\nWe're born to play, and brought up that way\nWe catch the women night and day\nAnd when I want to, I'll talk to you\nAnd you'll become one of the chosen few\nCan't you see that now I'm me?\nI'm the brother known as Ice-T\nAnd umm..

The freaking has just begun\nWe hit fifty more positions before I got done\nWhen we've got finished, it was no longer dark\nWe had rocked so hard, made the Snooty Fox bark\nThen she rolled over to me, she looked me in my eye\nAnd said these words to my surprise\nShe said: I tried to catch you, cause I knew I could\nI came here with you, cause I thought I should\nI tried to freak you, cause I thought I could\nBut oohh baby, you sure are good\nShe said: baby you're one hell of a man\nAin't no better riding than Disney Land\nNow to all you ladies that think you're fly\nAnd can out freak the average guy\nDon't ever come venturing through my door\nI'll have begging to stop, while you're screaming for more\nYo, please check it out\nAll the ladies in the house come check it out\nCause I'm a player with jewels on every hand\nSo deeply in pocket I control demand\nBut we all know how I earn my pay\nCause you don't wanna work, when you got to play\n\n[Break: Sound of cold wind blowing]\n\n[Verse 6: Ice-T]\nBrothers when you wine and dine a fox\nYou don't take her to Mc Donalds or to Jack In The Box\nDon't pick her up, in a bus or a cab\nShe needs a black belt chauffeur and a cornice wrap\nYou can take her to dine at the finest spot\nOr you take her to a disco that's really hot\nYou can take her home and while you're all alone\nDon't forget to disconnect the phone\nYou can take her to the bed, you throw back the sheets\nRock her butt to the rhythm of the beat...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/612b351ffec24338e85a86aa57e094bf.600x598x1.jpg", "artist": "Ice-T",

"[Verse 1: Ice-T]\nSome people claim that I'm born to play\nCause I'm your Ice-T on a sunny day\nI make the goers come, the leavers stay\nI make the lovers kiss and the workers play\nI make the runners walk, the quiet talk\nI bust so viciously, I make the blind man see\nI'm the ladies' cream, the virgins' wet dream\nI got that kind of movement that makes the young girls fiend\nI'm tired of these DJs going around\nTalking about how they go down to town\nCause I'm the best Rapper that you have found\nSo all you lovely ladies, let's party down\nTake all your rapping records, throw them in the trash\nIce-T is the only brother that you got to blast\nHook up the stereo, turn up the watts\nWe're gonna rock 'til the niggas call up the cops\nWe rock rock y'all with no fear, and\nIf you don't dig it turn off your ears\nWe rock rock y'all and keep on, and\nIf you don't dig it take your damn self home\nCause I'm a player, the best alive\nI prefer fast money to a Nine-to-Five\nFrom the womb to the tomb, I run my game\nCause I'm cold as ice, and I show no shame\n\n[Break: Sound of cold wind blowing]\n\n[Verse 2: Ice-T]\nWell I'm Ice-T, I'm terribly bad\nI'm here to knock out the windows and blow up the pad\nI may be small but I'm willing to say\nI jam this party in one hell of a way\nThe powers I got are hard to find\nI'll be breaking women's hearts while I'm blowing their minds\nThey be giving me money, and buying me things\nBut I spend their cash and pawn their rings\nIf they treat me right, I'm willing to show\nThe coolest young brother they'll ever know\nBut if they do me wrong, I hate to say\nI'll never teach them how to rock this way\nCause back in the thirties when times was hard\nI had a sawed-off shotgun, a marked deck of cards\nA turned up collar, a turned up hat\nA .38 hustle and I stole that\nI walked in the party, there were women for days\nAnd I started dancing one hell of a way\nI was dancing so hard, couldn't no one compete\nI turned out the party with my Ice-cold feet\nCause I'm a player, that's all I know\nOn a summer day, I play in the snow\nFrom the womb to the tomb, I run my game\nCause I'm cold as ice, and I show no shame\n\n[Break: Sound of cold wind blowing]\n\n[Verse 3: Ice-T]\nWe're born to play, and brought up that way\nWe catch the women night and day\nAnd when I want to, I'll talk to you\nAnd you'll become one of the chosen few\nCan't you see that now I'm me?\nI'm the brother known as Ice-T\nAnd umm.. I'm the brother whose like no other\nWhose black in soul but not in color\nYou dig the race, and a hit to the case\nWhen you're trying to get outta my face\nI'm trying to tell you I'm a brother that's nice\nI'm sweet as honey, I'm cold as Ice\nBut if you say something to me that ain't too down\nYou'll be picking your booty up off the ground\nYou can ask your father, your sister or mother\nI got a Rolls Royce in every color\nI keep my rides tuned to perfection\nI got a Stutz for every direction\nI'm the pimp, the player, the women layer\nThe holy dueler, the whorehouse doer\nI just play young whores, slam Cadillac doors\nI'm the black Mack of the heart attack\nBut I don't smoke no whack, I don't cut no slack\nI'm here to rock y'all, so rock rock\nI'm Ice-T when I dress, I never jive\nI do all my shopping on Rodeo Drive\nWhen I leave the pad, I'm never loud\nI'm just so sharp, I cut through the crowd\nI got so many clothes in my wardrobe these days\nWhen I put some in, I got to throw some away\nCause I'm a player, some call us Macks\nWith private phones in our Cadillacs\nFrom the womb to the tomb, we run our games\nCause we're cold as ice, and we show no shame\n\n[Break: Sound of cold wind blowing]\n\n[Verse 4: Ice-T]\nThe ladies say that I'm heaven sent\nCause I got more money than the US mint\nI ride Rag-Top Rolls with rocks on my hand\nMaseratis and Mercedes Benz\nI have an ocean liner, private jets\nBel-Air bookies place my bets\nI own islands off the coast of France\nNow I wear designer shirts and pants\nWhen I was brought into this world\nMy mamma never asked if I was boy or a girl\nFirst I rolled over to her, and gave her a kiss\nShe said: Your daddy don't rock me like this!\nWhen the doctor hit me on the behind\nI broke on down with a funky rhyme\nThe nurses said, I was awfully cute\nWhen I played out a joint, in a three piece suit\nYo yo yo, please, please, please check it out\nCause I'm a player, I'm always clean\nI bought a Mercedes Benz when I was seventeen\nFrom the womb to the tomb, I run my game\nCause I'm cold as ice, and I show no shame\n\n[Break: Sound of cold wind blowing]\n\n[Verse 5: Ice-T]\nThen I met this madam named Angel Adams (?)\nShe said she liked my style\nShe said sit down T, let me rap to you, for just a little while\nShe was a gravedigger, pulled .38 triggers\nShe's a lady in love and sent from above\nShe wasn't sly, she wasn't slick\nJust made that money real quick\nShe had a way of getting it fast\nIt came from dealing in cold cash\nShe ran her game with the utmost ease\nTo break a player down to his knees\nI said lady, put freeze on that rap, and\nPrepare yourself for a heart attack\nI took her by her hand, I said come with me\nWe drove off in my vicious eighty three\nI took her to diner, I took her to the show\nI took her to the Snooty cause she begged me to go\nWe got to the room, (?) man after long snaps\nSo she shook herself and broke herself came up with a gat\nShe went through the door, I didn't cut no slack\nI had her on the floor, on her stomach, on her back\nI had her on the wall, on the hall and on her knees\nI put her in the hot tub and the water started to freeze\nI took her out the hot tub then I put her on the floor\nShe said: \"Ooh Ice-T, I can't take no more\"\nI put her in the bed then she looked up in the mirror\nScreamed so loud, I think the East Coast could hear her\nI rolled on my back, I put her on the top\nShe said: \"Ooh Ice-T, will this ever stop?\"\nI said No! The freaking has just begun\nWe hit fifty more positions before I got done\nWhen we've got finished, it was no longer dark\nWe had rocked so hard, made the Snooty Fox bark\nThen she rolled over to me, she looked me in my eye\nAnd said these words to my surprise\nShe said: I tried to catch you, cause I knew I could\nI came here with you, cause I thought I should\nI tried to freak you, cause I thought I could\nBut oohh baby, you sure are good\nShe said: baby you're one hell of a man\nAin't no better riding than Disney Land\nNow to all you ladies that think you're fly\nAnd can out freak the average guy\nDon't ever come venturing through my door\nI'll have begging to stop, while you're screaming for more\nYo, please check it out\nAll the ladies in the house come check it out\nCause I'm a player with jewels on every hand\nSo deeply in pocket I control demand\nBut we all know how I earn my pay\nCause you don't wanna work, when you got to play\n\n[Break: Sound of cold wind blowing]\n\n[Verse 6: Ice-T]\nBrothers when you wine and dine a fox\nYou don't take her to Mc Donalds or to Jack In The Box\nDon't pick her up, in a bus or a cab\nShe needs a black belt chauffeur and a cornice wrap\nYou can take her to dine at the finest spot\nOr you take her to a disco that's really hot\nYou can take her home and while you're all alone\nDon't forget to disconnect the phone\nYou can take her to the bed, you throw back the sheets\nRock her butt to the rhythm of the beat..."}}, {"title": "I Love Ladies", "album": "Rhyme Pays", "year": null, "lyrics": "Ya heard the Ice was rockin', ticket sales were high\nBought some fresh Adidas so you could look fly\nBroke out from your crib rushin' to get here\nTripped ans stumbled almost broke your neck comin' down the stairs\nJumped into your ride, pushed the speed to the limit\nJumped out of your car faster than you jumped in it\nNow you're at the jam but in for a shock\nStupid big line wrapped around the block\nThrough the walls of the hall you could hear me rhyme\nMethodically you schemed a way to cut in line\nBut when you got inside the sight straightened your curls\nCause as you look around all you could see were girls\n\nI love ladies\n\nI think it's time that I tell the truth\nI been dissin' females since my early youth\nBut you know that's a drag and there's no doubt\nCause females are the one thing that I can't do without\nFemale companionship is my one vice\nI love to buy the girls things, love to treat em real nice\nHomeboys you must admit the best part of each day\nIs when a beautiful lady comes walkin' your way\nFemales possess that one commodity that no man will ever have\nNot that hangs around me\nThey got it, we want it, they move it, and flaunt it\nThey shake it and sway it, we'll die just to lay it\nWe try to supress it until they undress it\nAnd beg 'em to use it, and cry not to lose it\nNo man can deny it so don't even try it!!!\n\nI love ladies\nLadies are you with me?

(Yeeaahh!!)\nI Love Ladies\nLadies are you with me? (Yeeaahh!!)\nThat sounds nice (You know we love you Ice!!)\n\nNo when it comes to partyin' the ladies know how\nWhen I ask for a reply they always scream owww!!\nIt's the homeboys always tryin' to act real chill\nSometimes it's jealous MC's mad cause they ain't on the bill\nMaybe they scared if they say ho!\nThey might lose their cool\nBut I got some news for you: a fool's a fool\nBut don't get me wrong, most fellas do rock\nThey put their hands in the air, they take the show to the top\nThey start rockin' with the ladies once the show begins\nThey don't stand lookin' stupid like some mannequins\nThey don't lean against the wall like they're I some trance\nThey did not come with no intention to party or dance\nYou know what? yo dead beats should just stay home\nLeave me, my homeboys, and the ladies alone\n\nWe love ladies", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4087bd0151e7fc336a1bdb7aca3ef257.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Ice-T", "raw": {"annotation_count": 0, "api_path":

shock\nStupid big line wrapped around the block\nThrough the walls of the hall you could hear me rhyme\nMethodically you schemed a way to cut in line\nBut when you got inside the sight straightened your curls\nCause as you look around all you could see were girls\n\nI love ladies\n\nI think it's time that I tell the truth\nI been dissin' females since my early youth\nBut you know that's a drag

that's the title I held but the game is real fast\nYou gotta get in and get out if you expectin to last\nNow my homeboy Evil was downstairs chillin in his brand new Benz\nI had many adversaries but very few close friends\nWe broke to the set, E parked the car on the grass\nHigh-signin was his trademark and he did it with class\nHit the door like two titans, the whole jam stopped to stare\nAnd as we walked through the crowd they threw bills in the air\nI spied my man Jazz maxin out with two stone cold freaks\n\"Yo, what's up Ice, you rich now, man, you too good to speak?\"\nNow Jazz was a player from the east coast, the Bronx\nHe was known to be hard on the women and a brother he'd stomp\nSmack a bitch in a minute, some say just for fun\nAnd he was known for his chrome-plated

set\nCause what Donald-D wanted is what Donald-D'd get\nDonald's eyes hit mine and a smile crossed his face\nThen a light hit his ring and blinded the whole goddamn place\n\"Yo Ice, you the coolest and Evil, you mean\nBut I got the fliest new shit rollin off gasoline\"\nEveryone in the party moved quickly outside\nTo see Donald-D's ultimate Superfly ride\nIt was black, it was low, cost twice that of my Porsche\nA Testarossa Ferrari - convertable of course\nIt purred like a jet, \"Yo man, I bought it with cash\"\nIt had 'Donald-D' written in gold on the dash\nThen out of nowhere came a shot across the street\nI felt pain in my chest and my knees got weak\nThere was blood on my hands and I fell to the ground\nAnd all I could hear was, \"Yo, Ice is down!\"\nSomebody had shot me that

ain't changin' mine for nobody\nThey bleeped words from Doug's 'La Di Da Di'\nI can't get a bleep?What's the deal?\nMaybe my words are just too real\nIt's not profanity, it's just the man & me\nHe doesn't want you to see what I see\nDoesn't want you to be what you can be\nWord, censorship of reality\n\n\"Radio - suckers never play me\"(x3)(sample of PE \"rebel without a pause\")\n\nSuckers don't,but some do\nThe real troopers bring the Ice to you\nAnd close friends to me, yea, Public Enemy\nThese stations have high intellect\nThey don't pretend to be,too bourgeois to rock a jam raw\nUnderstand what I'm sayin', they're down by law\nThey play the jams that are right, sometimes not polite\nThey realize you gotta get some people uptight\nSpeak the word, your voice will definitely be heard\nLie to yourself, you're destined to be to the curb\nSome stations don't care, they'll never put on the air\nNothin' but commercial junk,their brain power's impaired\nThey don't listen or try to hear what I write\nMaybe just think once, or try some school at night\nThey're makin' radio wack, people have to escape\nBut even if I'm banned, I'll sell a million tapes\n\nRadio suckers never play me (x3)\n\nI make records for music, not for the money\nTo some of you that might sound funny\nBut I ain't broke,and I don't joke\nAnd my lyrics are known to make ears smoke\nClear as a gun scope, I speak the pure dope\nCan the radio handle the truth?...Nope\nUncut, no edits, no censors\nYou can get a plastic rapper from any ol' dispenser\nA penny a yard, to make a record ain't hard\nBut to make it mean something, that's a job\nBut then we do it, they refuse it\nSo I tell them duck suckers to cold go screw it\nWe shouldn't sell out,we should just yell out\nAnd get them wack motherfuckers the hell out\n\nRadio suckers never play me (x4)\n\nCruisin' down the street what do I see?\nCrash Task Force, L.A.P.D\nGangs illin', wildin' and killin'\nHustlers on a roll, like they got a million\nGirls on the strap and you know that\nYou know the guys will stop wildin' if you stop that crap\nBut you can't, you want money so bad\nYou'll jock anything with the Gucci tag\nYou gotta have it, so the men go get it\nRobbin' and stealin', soon to regret it\nLivin' in a jail cell, feelin' like a dumbbell\nWhile you jump the next jock, well\nThat's reality, that's what I see\nNobody says that you have to agree\nCensorship, that ain't the way to be\nI thought you said this country was free?\n\nRadio suckers never play me (x2)\n\nTone it down is what they say to me\nThe FCC will not allow profanity\nYour subject matter's too hard, make a love song\nYou better get real,come on\nI ain't no lover, I'm a fighter\nHard core radical rap rhyme writer\nPushin' the button, E does the cuttin'\nEverything I say amounts to something\nMore than a single rap,I'm too deep for that\nI lay my lyrics with logic, press the wax\nPlay it on your tape deck, feel the effect\nIf you can't take the heat, eject\nBut I know you can, cause you're an Ice-T fan\nNo sell-outs here, my man\n\nRadio....(fade out)", "image":

as I commence, my lyrics intense\nYour telephoto, break out your big lens\nLook, check out the sales charts\nMy record's kickin', I'm breakin' P.D.'s hearts\nThey banned me from their shows\nBecause they said I'm too hard\nBut no sell-out,I guess I'm just barred\nI ain't changin' mine for nobody\nThey bleeped words from Doug's 'La Di Da Di'\nI can't get a bleep?What's the deal?\nMaybe my words are just too real\nIt's not profanity, it's just the man & me\nHe doesn't want you to see what I see\nDoesn't want you to be what you can be\nWord, censorship of reality\n\n\"Radio - suckers never play me\"(x3)(sample of PE \"rebel without a pause\")\n\nSuckers don't,but some do\nThe real troopers bring the Ice to you\nAnd close friends to me, yea, Public Enemy\nThese stations have high intellect\nThey don't pretend to be,too bourgeois to rock a jam raw\nUnderstand what I'm sayin', they're down by law\nThey play the jams that are right, sometimes not polite\nThey realize you gotta get some people uptight\nSpeak the word, your voice will definitely be heard\nLie to yourself, you're destined to be to the curb\nSome stations don't care, they'll never put on the air\nNothin' but commercial junk,their brain power's impaired\nThey don't listen or try to hear what I write\nMaybe just think once, or try some school at night\nThey're makin' radio wack, people have to escape\nBut even if I'm banned, I'll sell a million tapes\n\nRadio suckers never play me (x3)\n\nI make records for music, not for the money\nTo some of you that might sound funny\nBut I ain't broke,and I don't joke\nAnd my lyrics are known to make ears smoke\nClear as a gun scope, I speak the pure dope\nCan the radio handle the truth?...Nope\nUncut, no edits, no censors\nYou can get a plastic rapper from any ol' dispenser\nA penny a yard, to make a record ain't hard\nBut to make it mean something, that's a job\nBut then we do it, they refuse it\nSo I tell them duck suckers to cold go screw it\nWe shouldn't sell out,we should just yell out\nAnd get them wack motherfuckers the hell out\n\nRadio suckers never play me (x4)\n\nCruisin' down the street what do I see?\nCrash Task Force, L.A.P.D\nGangs illin', wildin' and killin'\nHustlers on a roll, like they got a million\nGirls on the strap and you know that\nYou know the guys will stop wildin' if you stop that crap\nBut you can't, you want money so bad\nYou'll jock anything with the Gucci tag\nYou gotta have it, so the men go get it\nRobbin' and stealin', soon to regret it\nLivin' in a jail cell, feelin' like a dumbbell\nWhile you jump the next jock, well\nThat's reality, that's what I see\nNobody says that you have to agree\nCensorship, that ain't the way to be\nI thought you said this country was free?\n\nRadio suckers never play me (x2)\n\nTone it down is what they say to me\nThe FCC will not allow profanity\nYour subject matter's too hard, make a love song\nYou better get real,come on\nI ain't no lover, I'm a fighter\nHard core radical rap rhyme writer\nPushin' the button, E does the cuttin'\nEverything I say amounts to something\nMore than a single rap,I'm too deep for that\nI lay my lyrics with logic, press the wax\nPlay it on your tape deck, feel the effect\nIf you can't take the heat, eject\nBut I know you can, cause you're an Ice-T fan\nNo sell-outs here, my man\n\nRadio....(fade out)"}}, {"title": "Please Believe Me", "album": "Gangsta Rap", "year": null, "lyrics": "[Intro: Ice-T conversating with his daughter]\n[Ice-T] Baby, I wanna let you know I really like how this is going down\n[Daugh] Yeah, I like how it's going down too, daddy!\n[Ice-T] Though we can make big moves, baby I know, real big moves..\n[Daugh] Ummm.. just tell me what I gotta do and I'm down for whatever!\n\n[Chorus: Corte X2]\nGirl, if you do what I tell you to\nYou can have this whole world if you wanted to\nBuddy, it ain't going to be easy\nJust listen to a player, and please believe me!\n\n[Verse One: Ice-T]\nLet's start this off with facts\nYou got on some nice shoes but you walk in it\nYou got on nice coat but you're outside it\nNow, if you're ready to accept that state you was made in upgrade\nHiding up your game in form\nI can let you come over here with me and get real real warm\nThey say: if you knew better, you'll choose better\nAnd you think wrong, you think wrong\nYou can't swing a slow batter the fast pitch\nThe problem with most of you women, y'all so used to loosing\nYou can't even figure out what you want\nNow first, we gotta let you know everything\nIf you did - you'll be living on the side of the mountains\nSomewhere in Seattle like Bill Gates\nAnd I don't know everything that's true\nBut I definitely do know more than you\nOne thing is you got style, cause you quote my eye\nTwo is you got class, that's what makes you fly\nThree is you're intelligent cause you're listening to me talk\nAnd four is you're very very sexy, you can see that in the way you walk\nBut all that ain't work nothing if you don't get it together and move something\nNow, this game is played in ones and twos, that means soloists and crews\nAnd that's exactly what I'm trying to do, is team up with you\nBut you have to learn how to take some instructions, boo\nPlease believe this, and listen to me\n\n[Chorus: Corte X2]\n\n[Verse Two: Smoothe Da Hustler]\nAlright, baby look..\nI can see you harmonious cause your rent is more than my mortgage\nSo it's obvious you ain't got enough left to pay attention\nBut I.. I'ma renew your lease for a small fee\nThen we gonna psychologically house-shop\nSo you can have some space for that brain of yours\nConsider me Real Estate\nNow, I can't front, you're fly\nAnd you're hanging around me for some reason so I must be the shelter\nThey say: conversation is like a combination\nSo I'ma open that safe, take a turn at it\nYou want-a dime, yeah, you want-a dime\nBut your nigga paint you a picture\nHow much cents do that make?\nAlright then.. now, what you should do\nIs grow some hands on that forehead of yours\nSo you can hold that thought\nI see you used to get in your way that's why you go on the wrong direction\nYou need a RUN D.M.C. and 'Walk This Way'\nDon't you need two pilots to fly the plane?\nBut only one get to hold the steering wheel, baby\nSo sit back, relax your ass, cause you're flying first class\nAnd this going to be a smooth ride, baby, and please believe me\n\n[Chorus: Corte X2]\n\n[Verse Three: Ice-T]\nNow, I'ma give you the real deal\nI'm going to need at least two more inches on them heels\nAnd that gut made up cool to you, but I'ma ask you for a stirrup or two\nAnd as for your hair.. I ain't even going to go there\nJust keep it clean and tight, and would be alright\nOverall.. I think you're fine\nAnd I'm sure I can buck out the dime\nAnd this is going to take a little time\nFirst, you got to forget everything you know\nCause right now..\nYou're on a real course to becoming a real motherfucking whore\nNow, that's cool too..\nBut at least let me show you how to be a motherfucking pro\nCause it ain't going to be all fun\nIf you're fucking with me, you better duck or run\nThis is final level of the game baby\nAnd it ain't going to be all biscuits and gravy\nYou got to have a nerve, for the motherfucking curve\nCause we can do it either way, baby\nThe street way, or the corporate sweet way\nBut no matter how me and you do it, girl\nIt would definitely.. be the elite way\n\n[Interlude: Ice-T and his daughter conversation continues]\n[Daugh] Awww! you know, I'm down, baby\n[Ice-T] That's what I'm talking about\n[Daugh] Ha ha ha ha!\n[Ice-T] Yeah, I know you like it when I see you smilling..\n[Daugh] Ha ha ha ha ha!\n[Ice-T] Yeah girl, I see you're feeling this right..\n\n[Chorus: Corte X2]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/44e03781386ef22a962df8d6b6e26c72.640x640x1.jpg", "artist": "Ice-T", "raw": {"annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/23101",

how it's going down too, daddy!\n[Ice-T] Though we can make big moves, baby I know, real big moves..\n[Daugh] Ummm.. just tell me what I gotta do and I'm down for whatever!\n\n[Chorus: Corte X2]\nGirl, if you do what I tell you to\nYou can have this whole world if you wanted to\nBuddy, it ain't going to be easy\nJust listen to a player, and please believe me!\n\n[Verse One: Ice-T]\nLet's start this off with facts\nYou got on some nice shoes but you walk in it\nYou got on nice coat but you're outside it\nNow, if you're ready to accept that state you was made in upgrade\nHiding up your game in form\nI can let you come over here with me and get real real warm\nThey say: if you knew better, you'll choose better\nAnd you think wrong, you think wrong\nYou can't swing a slow batter the fast pitch\nThe problem with most of you women, y'all so used to loosing\nYou can't even figure out what you want\nNow first, we gotta let you know everything\nIf you did - you'll be living on the side of the mountains\nSomewhere in Seattle like Bill Gates\nAnd I don't know everything that's true\nBut I definitely do know more than you\nOne thing is you got style, cause you quote my eye\nTwo is you got class, that's what makes you fly\nThree is you're intelligent cause you're listening to me talk\nAnd four is you're very very sexy, you can see that in the way you walk\nBut all that ain't work nothing if you don't get it together and move something\nNow, this game is played in ones and twos, that means soloists and crews\nAnd that's exactly what I'm trying to do, is team up with you\nBut you have to learn how to take some instructions, boo\nPlease believe this, and listen to me\n\n[Chorus: Corte X2]\n\n[Verse Two: Smoothe Da Hustler]\nAlright, baby look..\nI can see you harmonious cause your rent is more than my mortgage\nSo it's obvious you ain't got enough left to pay attention\nBut I.. I'ma renew your lease for a small fee\nThen we gonna psychologically house-shop\nSo you can have some space for that brain of yours\nConsider me Real Estate\nNow, I can't front, you're fly\nAnd you're hanging around me for some reason so I must be the shelter\nThey say: conversation is like a combination\nSo I'ma open that safe, take a turn at it\nYou want-a dime, yeah, you want-a dime\nBut your nigga paint you a picture\nHow much cents do that make?\nAlright then.. now, what you should do\nIs grow some hands on that forehead of yours\nSo you can hold that thought\nI see you used to get in your way that's why you go on the wrong direction\nYou need a RUN D.M.C. and 'Walk This Way'\nDon't you need two pilots to fly the plane?\nBut only one get to hold the steering wheel, baby\nSo sit back, relax your ass, cause you're flying first class\nAnd this going to be a smooth ride, baby, and please believe me\n\n[Chorus: Corte X2]\n\n[Verse Three: Ice-T]\nNow, I'ma give you the real deal\nI'm going to need at least two more inches on them heels\nAnd that gut made up cool to you, but I'ma ask you for a stirrup or two\nAnd as for your hair.. I ain't even going to go there\nJust keep it clean and tight, and would be alright\nOverall.. I think you're fine\nAnd I'm sure I can buck out the dime\nAnd this is going to take a little time\nFirst, you got to forget everything you know\nCause right now..\nYou're on a real course to becoming a real motherfucking whore\nNow, that's cool too..\nBut at least let me show you how to be a motherfucking pro\nCause it ain't going to be all fun\nIf you're fucking with me, you better duck or run\nThis is final level of the game baby\nAnd it ain't going to be all biscuits and gravy\nYou got to have a nerve, for the motherfucking curve\nCause we can do it either way, baby\nThe street way, or the corporate sweet way\nBut no matter how me and you do it, girl\nIt would definitely.. be the elite way\n\n[Interlude: Ice-T and his daughter conversation continues]\n[Daugh] Awww! you know, I'm down, baby\n[Ice-T] That's what I'm talking about\n[Daugh] Ha ha ha ha!\n[Ice-T] Yeah, I know you like it when I see you smilling..\n[Daugh] Ha ha ha ha ha!\n[Ice-T] Yeah girl, I see you're feeling this right..\n\n[Chorus: Corte X2]"}}, {"title": "This One's for Me", "album": "The Iceberg / Freedom of Speech...

to rip\nAll you chump MC's who sell out quick\nWhen P.E. was on the top, you rode the tip\nBut now they got problems and you suckers run\nWho's Chuck's real friends, does he really have one?\nYou yell P.E. this, P.E. that\nFist in the air, proud to be black\nNow they got static and you run like punks\nI haven't heard an MC stand up for him once\nMaybe you suckers are just hopin that they fall

Before a show in Columbus, Ga. Ice T was warned that he would be arrested if he used profanity during his performance. The controversy that broke off from the censorship issues in the late 1980s led to Ice T\u2019s release of this third album.\n\nMore specifically, Ice T\u2019s 8th track, \u201cHit the Deck,\u201d seems to be a boasting rap on the surface. Simply listening to the beats and raps, you immediately get the vibe of Ice T building himself and his raps up. What makes this rap different from any other boasting rap is Ice T\u2019s use of diction and how he presents it to his audience. The figurative language evokes powerful images into the minds of the listener. The technological terminology that Ice raps to us, is significant in numerous ways. His choice of words make the rap unique to Ice\u2019s style and allow you a sense of how he is feeling. Being caught up in all the censorship issues, Ice T uses this rap to pump up himself and his audience through his artistic and poetic ability. He uses his boasting metaphorically to challenge other competitors on the mic. The rap is not meant in a literal way; instead the lyrics connote the playful use of language itself.\n\nIce T speaks out on his continuing views of the censorship issue in the 1992 Rolling Stone interview with Alan Light. Although this interview is based off of his song \u201cCop Killer,\u201d from the album Body Count. His views on the censorship issues remain the same. Ice argues in the interview, \u201cThere\u2019s freedom of speech, but you can\u2019t speak out against the government\u2026 That\u2019s all bullshit I have the right to say how I feel\u2026\u201d\n\nAlthough, this song \u201cHit the Deck,\u201d is simply a rap about boasting, Ice T obviously has deeper feelings and issues that he masks with this specific song through his playful lyrics."}, "embed_content": "<div id='rg_embed_link_23090' class='rg_embed_link' data-song-id='23090'>Read <a href='https://genius.com/Ice-t-hit-the-deck-lyrics'>\u201cHit the Deck\u201d by Ice-T</a> on Genius</div> <script crossorigin src='//genius.com/songs/23090/embed.js'></script>", "featured_video": false, "full_title": "Hit the Deck by\u00a0Ice-T", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/8130dc496c2cedd8004532bb340c7c91.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/8130dc496c2cedd8004532bb340c7c91.800x800x1.jpg", "id": 23090, "lyrics_owner_id": 50, "lyrics_state": "complete", "path": "/Ice-t-hit-the-deck-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "recording_location": null, "release_date": "1989-10-10", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/8130dc496c2cedd8004532bb340c7c91.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/8130dc496c2cedd8004532bb340c7c91.800x800x1.jpg", "stats": {"accepted_annotations": 0, "contributors": 5, "hot": false, "iq_earners": 5, "transcribers": 0, "unreviewed_annotations": 12, "verified_annotations": 0}, "title": "Hit the Deck", "title_with_featured": "Hit the Deck", "url": "https://genius.com/Ice-t-hit-the-deck-lyrics", "current_user_metadata": {"permissions": ["view_apple_music_player", "create_comment", "view_song_story_gallery"], "excluded_permissions": ["follow", "award_transcription_iq", "remove_transcription_iq", "see_pageviews", "pyong", "edit_lyrics", "view_annotation_engagement_data", "publish", "unpublish", "edit_spotify_details", "hide", "unhide", "toggle_featured_video", "add_pinned_annotation_to", "add_community_annotation_to", "destroy", "mark_as_not_spam", "edit_spotify_annotations_for", "verify_lyrics", "unverify_lyrics", "edit_anything", "edit_any_media", "edit", "rename", "edit_tags", "watch_fact_track", "reindex", "view_lyrics_synchronization", "enable_media", "disable_media", "edit_lyrics_or_annotation_brackets", "see_editorial_indicators", "view_attribution_visualization", "edit_annotation_brackets", "preview_lyrics_for_export", "hide_apple_player", "unhide_apple_player", "trigger_apple_match", "mark_lyrics_evaluation_as_approved", "mark_lyrics_evaluation_as_staff_approved", "mark_lyrics_evaluation_as_unapproved", "mark_lyrics_evaluation_as_un_staff_approved", "view_transcriber_media_player", "override_apple_match", "edit_youtube_url", "edit_soundcloud_url", "edit_spotify_uuid", "edit_vevo_url", "moderate_annotations", "create_annotation", "see_short_id", "manage_chart_item", "create_tag", "propose_lyrics_edit", "moderate_lyrics_edit_proposals"], "interactions": {"pyong": false, "following": false}, "relationships": {}, "iq_by_action": {}}, "album": {"api_path": "/albums/3755", "cover_art_url": "https://images.genius.com/8130dc496c2cedd8004532bb340c7c91.800x800x1.jpg", "full_title": "The Iceberg / Freedom of Speech...

Being caught up in all the censorship issues, Ice T uses this rap to pump up himself and his audience through his artistic and poetic ability. He uses his boasting metaphorically to challenge other competitors on the mic. The rap is not meant in a literal way; instead the lyrics connote the playful use of language itself.\n\nIce T speaks out on his continuing views of the censorship issue in the 1992 Rolling Stone interview with Alan Light. Although this interview is based off of his song \u201cCop Killer,\u201d from the album Body Count. His views on the censorship issues remain the same. Ice argues in the interview, \u201cThere\u2019s freedom of speech, but you can\u2019t speak out against the government\u2026 That\u2019s all bullshit I have the right to say how I feel\u2026\u201d\n\nAlthough, this song \u201cHit the Deck,\u201d is simply a rap about boasting, Ice T obviously has deeper feelings and issues that he masks with this specific song through his playful lyrics."}, "comment_count": 0, "community": true, "custom_preview": null, "has_voters": false, "id": 3513477, "pinned": false, "share_url": "https://genius.com/3513477", "source": null,

got the player hater venom\nI wanna take 'em outside and lay some slugs up in em\n\n[King T]\nWhen they need work\nThey call the cali drug expert\nSmashing in a six hundred dollar bill burnt\nLooking flossy living costly\nOff the edge, out of state\nThey gots to break bread, for sho\nI needs mo' ice drops for the lexo\nBriggetts sets blow when I'm sipping the mo'\nFreelancing, trying to build a mansion\nAnd stay faded\nHave hoes walk around my crib butt naked...\n\n[Ice-T]\nTrue, pop the remy kick back and let the players represent\nHigh floss true boss game and take aim\nThese sucka wannabe's\nNigga please - you're green\nI'll bend hoes on the downlow - banks obscene\nWanna chill with these niggas, bet you wish you could\nAnd suck game out my ass like sponges\nI run this\nYou

throwing up the W\nBringing trouble to\nThose in sight\nKing T and Big Ice\n\nChorus:\n\n[Ice-T]\nBut T that's trippin' and that ain't my sport\nI'd rather lamp in my crib and flip the Robb report\nAnd set my v-dozen on the streets\nBump my beats\nCause when I'm twisting my dubs\nCan't nobody compete\nImagine this:\nA hundred G 'lex on your wrist\nImagine this:\nAbout ten karrots on your fist\nImagine this:\nAll dime hoes on your list\nHa - that shit would be nice\nBut your name ain't \"Ice\" - kid...\nI'll screw the silencer on - rock you softly\nHow you gonna step to me kid?

long time, man...\nWhy don't you drop some knowledge for these brothers who\nWant to get involved in this war...\n\nTake notes: real gangstas wear trench coats\nGrey suits, black ties and they seek votes\nAnd you're not to be misled\nThey'll kill you in your fuckin' bed\nThey don't sell dope, yo, excuse me, yes they do\nBut they don't look that much like me or you\nBut if you pull up the sheets and expose them\nThey'll crawl up like snakes and show fangs of venom\nNow I've been soldier for years\nRepresentin' the tattooed tears\nOther brothas locked up with no choice\nLeft in the bowels of the devil with no voice\nMy phones are tapped, my crib is bugged\nMy car is tailed from club to club\nAnd this ain't no fuckin' joke\nThey want to see a nigga broke\nYou can't slip, if you slip you're out\nYou gotta know what you're talkin' about\nDrop science every chance you get\nHit direct and indirect, speak in code\nCause you're never alone\nThat's why I use this low tone\nFollow this and you might grow older\nThis is a message to the soldiers...\n\nNow they killed King and they shot X\nNow they want me, you could be next\nAll you gotta do is speak too loud\nAll you gotta be is be too proud\nCause once you let'em know\nWho you are and where you're at\nYou better watch your back\nCause you might think you're just dope\nWhile you're livin' in a sniper's scope\nI'm not tryin' to scare you\nBut there's a danger if you get too deep\nSome nights I don't sleep\nAll you wanna do is tell the truth\nAll you wanna do is save the youth\nIce Cube knows, Souljah knows, P.E. knows\nThey throw death blows\nAnd if you got kids or a girl that's true\nThey'll move on them too\nBut when I'm gone I need you to carry on\nYou gotta be strong and fight for our salvation\nBut there will be retaliation, soldier...\n\nTo think that rap could be attacked\nIs ignorin' the simple fact\nThat they never ment us to speak\nThey had planned to keep the black man weak\nBut rap hit the streets\nBlack rage amplified over dope beats\nNow they want to shut us down\nAnd they don't fuck around\nCheck the history books, son\nBlack leaders die young\nThey tell us that your words are scary\nThey're revolutionary\nBecause we speak the truth\nAbout crime and drugs\nAnd expose the real thugs\nThis info is not beneficial\nTo the groups that go by three initals\nSo they try to discredit\nThey'll dog you with an edit\nPrint the words the way you never said it\nBut we gotta make'em regret it, soldiers...\n\nWord! I know a lot of brothas out there want to get in this war...\nYou know what I'm sayin'? a lot of sistas got a lot of knowledge\nTo drop on our people but right now they're movin' to shut down\nAll hip-hop! The first amendment had absolutely nothin' to do\nWith black people at the time constitution was written, we were\nConsidered nothin' but property...The expectation of havin' black\nPeople speak on records never came to mind, so we gotta move!\nBut belive me all the black leaders have been silenced and most\nOf the time it's been violent so if you choose to get in this war\nRealize what you're in for but we gotta move on...\nAnd we gotta stay strong...\n\nMessage to the soldiers, welcome to the struggle...\nMessage to the soldiers, be careful, soldiers...", "image":

"Artist: Ice-T\nAlbum: Home Invasion\nSong: Message To The Soldier\n\nYo, Ice, you been down with the struggle for a long time, man...\nWhy don't you drop some knowledge for these brothers who\nWant to get involved in this war...\n\nTake notes: real gangstas wear trench coats\nGrey suits, black ties and they seek votes\nAnd you're not to be misled\nThey'll kill you in your fuckin' bed\nThey don't sell dope, yo, excuse me, yes they do\nBut they don't look that much like me or you\nBut if you pull up the sheets and expose them\nThey'll crawl up like snakes and show fangs of venom\nNow I've been soldier for years\nRepresentin' the tattooed tears\nOther brothas locked up with no choice\nLeft in the bowels of the devil with no voice\nMy phones are tapped, my crib is bugged\nMy car is tailed from club to club\nAnd this ain't no fuckin' joke\nThey want to see a nigga broke\nYou can't slip, if you slip you're out\nYou gotta know what you're talkin' about\nDrop science every chance you get\nHit direct and indirect, speak in code\nCause you're never alone\nThat's why I use this low tone\nFollow this and you might grow older\nThis is a message to the soldiers...\n\nNow they killed King and they shot X\nNow they want me, you could be next\nAll you gotta do is speak too loud\nAll you gotta be is be too proud\nCause once you let'em know\nWho you are and where you're at\nYou better watch your back\nCause you might think you're just dope\nWhile you're livin' in a sniper's scope\nI'm not tryin' to scare you\nBut there's a danger if you get too deep\nSome nights I don't sleep\nAll you wanna do is tell the truth\nAll you wanna do is save the youth\nIce Cube knows, Souljah knows, P.E. knows\nThey throw death blows\nAnd if you got kids or a girl that's true\nThey'll move on them too\nBut when I'm gone I need you to carry on\nYou gotta be strong and fight for our salvation\nBut there will be retaliation, soldier...\n\nTo think that rap could be attacked\nIs ignorin' the simple fact\nThat they never ment us to speak\nThey had planned to keep the black man weak\nBut rap hit the streets\nBlack rage amplified over dope beats\nNow they want to shut us down\nAnd they don't fuck around\nCheck the history books, son\nBlack leaders die young\nThey tell us that your words are scary\nThey're revolutionary\nBecause we speak the truth\nAbout crime and drugs\nAnd expose the real thugs\nThis info is not beneficial\nTo the groups that go by three initals\nSo they try to discredit\nThey'll dog you with an edit\nPrint the words the way you never said it\nBut we gotta make'em regret it, soldiers...\n\nWord! I know a lot of brothas out there want to get in this war...\nYou know what I'm sayin'? a lot of sistas got a lot of knowledge\nTo drop on our people but right now they're movin' to shut down\nAll hip-hop! The first amendment had absolutely nothin' to do\nWith black people at the time constitution was written, we were\nConsidered nothin' but property...The expectation of havin' black\nPeople speak on records never came to mind, so we gotta move!\nBut belive me all the black leaders have been silenced and most\nOf the time it's been violent so if you choose to get in this war\nRealize what you're in for but we gotta move on...\nAnd we gotta stay strong...\n\nMessage to the soldiers, welcome to the struggle...\nMessage to the soldiers, be careful, soldiers..."}}, {"title": "Hit the Fan", "album": "Home Invasion", "year": "1993-03-23", "lyrics": "[ Shawnie Shawn ]\nYo, what's goin on Ice?\n[ Ice-T ]\nYo what's up Shawnie Shawn?\nMan, just trippin off this girl, man\n[ Shawnie Shawn ]\nGirls?\nYou?\nThe Iceberg?\nAw man, come on, spill it, man\n\nShe was a swinger\nTalkin 'bout high post\nShe was the most\nKnew she was fine, dope, fly\nShe didn't have to try\nShe brought a eye on my eye in a crowded club\nI tried to stare the girl down, but she didn't budge\nShe moved through the crowd in a straight line\nThe closer she got, mad thoughts ran through my mind\nYo, what would I say, yo, how would I chill?\nMy mind drew a blank, the whole scene was ill\nShe stepped in the light, she was dynamite\nHer eyes said, \"I wanna be with you all night\nI wanna rub you down, I wanna kiss, caress your soul\nMake your body warm and cold\nDo everything sexually you ever heard\"\nAnd she hadn't said a single word..\nI said, \"Damn, what the hell am I gonna do?\"\nBut my eyes said the same things too\nI tried to speak, she put a finger across my lips\nFollowed it with a kiss\nShe said, \"I want you bad,\" and she moved in next to me\nThis woman spelled out ecstacy\nSaid, \"I've seen on the movies and TV\nI love your records, but I ain't no groupie\nJust wanna love ya, cause you're a real man\nAnd you deserve this lovin like only I can\"\nI wanted her bad, and I am a man\nThat night the shit hit the fan\n\n[ Shawnie Shawn ]\nDamn, man\nKeep on with it, man\nCome on now kick it, man\nYou gotta kick it right, though\nLet me know what's up\n\nShe had a 500 S-E-L airtight\nCellular phone, brand-new, it was white on white\nAs we walked to the car, I couldn't help but recognize\nHer small waist and sexy thighs\nShe had a beach house she owned and a restaurant\nTook me in her crib and put Sade on\nAs the waves hit the rocks in the moonlight\nShe came up behind me and squeezed me real tight\nMy mind started to trip, flip, roll, and roam\nWhat about my girl who's at sleep at home?\nBut before I could lock in on that thought\nShe broke out with a new men's watch that she had bought\nShe put it round my wrist, it was a perfect fit\nAnd said in my ear, \"Want you to have it\"\nThen she unzipped her dress, dropped it to the ground\nMy mind was totally blown by now\nShe gazed at me nude in the moonlight\nPumps still on, her body was firm and tight\nI looked at her breasts as they glistened and rised\nRight before my eyes\nAnd all I could say to myself was, \"Damn..\"\nThe night the shit hit the fan\n\n[ Shawnie Shawn ]\nMan, man, man\nI understand...\n(The night the shit hit the fan)\nCome on now\nI feel it\nCome on\n(The night the shit hit the fan)\nDamn, man\nIt's all that\nShit\nCome on, Ice\nKick that shit\n\nNow I'm a player, I been all around the world\nMade love to many girls\nBut tonight this was the big league\nAnd I was worryin about fatigue\nI wanna do this girl, so she won't forget me\nAnd I knew that she'd let me\nShe moved close and took my shirt off\nShe said my skin was soft\nThen slipped her hand\nBetween my stomach and my waist band\nMan, I couldn't take it no more\nFuck the bedroom, we use the kitchen floor\nWe hit skins all weekend\nWe didn't even eat, we just hit em again\nI love to think about how it went down\nBut she's no longer around\nLeft town with some fly guy\nShe's on some island drinkin D'Acqueray's and Mai Thai's\nBut she gave me the keys to the beach house\nShe knows what I'm about, at least now she figured out\nI ain't nothin but a straight up man\nAnd I might need those keys the next time the shit hits the fan\n\nYeah\n\nUh!\n\nYeah\n\nUh..\n\nYeah\n\nUh\n\nI want her\n\n[ Shawnie Shawn ]\nDamn\nAll that, all that\nAnd after all that\nYou know?\nYou always know, man\nIn the long run\nYou meet another one like the other one", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e31ea71297e7a9f7b5274df3c469e7d9.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Ice-T", "raw": {"annotation_count": 1,

Shawnie Shawn ]\nYo, what's goin on Ice?\n[ Ice-T ]\nYo what's up Shawnie Shawn?\nMan, just trippin off this girl, man\n[ Shawnie Shawn ]\nGirls?\nYou?\nThe Iceberg?\nAw man, come on, spill it, man\n\nShe was a swinger\nTalkin 'bout high post\nShe was the most\nKnew she was fine, dope, fly\nShe didn't have to try\nShe brought a eye on my eye in a crowded club\nI tried to stare the girl down, but she didn't budge\nShe moved through the crowd in a straight line\nThe closer she got, mad thoughts ran through my mind\nYo, what would I say, yo, how would I chill?\nMy mind drew a blank, the whole scene was ill\nShe stepped in the light, she was dynamite\nHer eyes said, \"I wanna be with you all night\nI wanna rub you down, I wanna kiss, caress your soul\nMake your body warm and cold\nDo everything sexually you ever heard\"\nAnd she hadn't said a single word..\nI said, \"Damn, what the hell am I gonna do?\"\nBut my eyes said the same things too\nI tried to speak, she put a finger across my lips\nFollowed it with a kiss\nShe said, \"I want you bad,\" and she moved in next to me\nThis woman spelled out ecstacy\nSaid, \"I've seen on the movies and TV\nI love your records, but I ain't no groupie\nJust wanna love ya, cause you're a real man\nAnd you deserve this lovin like only I can\"\nI wanted her bad, and I am a man\nThat night the shit hit the fan\n\n[ Shawnie Shawn ]\nDamn, man\nKeep on with it, man\nCome on now kick it, man\nYou gotta kick it right, though\nLet me know what's up\n\nShe had a 500 S-E-L airtight\nCellular phone, brand-new, it was white on white\nAs we walked to the car, I couldn't help but recognize\nHer small waist and sexy thighs\nShe had a beach house she owned and a restaurant\nTook me in her crib and put Sade on\nAs the waves hit the rocks in the moonlight\nShe came up behind me and squeezed me real tight\nMy mind started to trip, flip, roll, and roam\nWhat about my girl who's at sleep at home?\nBut before I could lock in on that thought\nShe broke out with a new men's watch that she had bought\nShe put it round my wrist, it was a perfect fit\nAnd said in my ear, \"Want you to have it\"\nThen she unzipped her dress, dropped it to the ground\nMy mind was totally blown by now\nShe gazed at me nude in the moonlight\nPumps still on, her body was firm and tight\nI looked at her breasts as they glistened and rised\nRight before my eyes\nAnd all I could say to myself was, \"Damn..\"\nThe night the shit hit the fan\n\n[ Shawnie Shawn ]\nMan, man, man\nI understand...\n(The night the shit hit the fan)\nCome on now\nI feel it\nCome on\n(The night the shit hit the fan)\nDamn, man\nIt's all that\nShit\nCome on, Ice\nKick that shit\n\nNow I'm a player, I been all around the world\nMade love to many girls\nBut tonight this was the big league\nAnd I was worryin about fatigue\nI wanna do this girl, so she won't forget me\nAnd I knew that she'd let me\nShe moved close and took my shirt off\nShe said my skin was soft\nThen slipped her hand\nBetween my stomach and my waist band\nMan, I couldn't take it no more\nFuck the bedroom, we use the kitchen floor\nWe hit skins all weekend\nWe didn't even eat, we just hit em again\nI love to think about how it went down\nBut she's no longer around\nLeft town with some fly guy\nShe's on some island drinkin D'Acqueray's and Mai Thai's\nBut she gave me the keys to the beach house\nShe knows what I'm about, at least now she figured out\nI ain't nothin but a straight up man\nAnd I might need those keys the next time the shit hits the fan\n\nYeah\n\nUh!\n\nYeah\n\nUh..\n\nYeah\n\nUh\n\nI want her\n\n[ Shawnie Shawn ]\nDamn\nAll that, all that\nAnd after all that\nYou know?\nYou always know, man\nIn the long run\nYou meet another one like the other one"}}, {"title": "Pimp Anthem", "album": "VI - Return of the Real", "year": null, "lyrics": "'96\nAh shit\nIce-T back\nRepresentin, nigga, once again\nThat real shit, nigga\nI

type of pimpin happens every day\n\n[ VERSE 1 ]\nNiggas wanna know my steelo\nBitches wanna get with the baddest\nHustlin apparatus\nIt's the LA cash flow master-roller\nNo one gets colder, I used to flip boulders\nOf caine, on my brain, it's outta control, crime plot\nA dead-ass cop and muthafuckas get got\nIn the game it ain't safe for the weak or the timid\nKnown to break a bitch but barely rarely slide up in it\nSo you see me in a club, grab your woman like you wanna\nBlink your eyes and the freak is out there freezin on the corner\nShe got caught by the curls and the jewels\nLookin for a nigga that is quick to pull tools\nNow she's breakin herself, makin herself\nRespect my technique of pimpin, minus all simpin\nCheck it bitches, it ain't nothin nice\nYou're gonna seal or sell pussy if you roll with the Ice\n\n[ Hook ]\n\n[ VERSE 2 ]\nOh my God, the nigga rolls hard..\nEvery player mentions me\nThe hustler of the century\n(Ice, that nigga ain't nothin nice!)\nI got more freaks

don't smoke endo, I count cash on my patio\nSo much love on the streets, don't need no bodyguard\nBig up to my homies with the pimp type nod\nI'm off the hook, checkin traps in Vegas [Name]\nFull link mink with the matchin borsalino\nI change cars like you change drawers, bitch\nI got a stable full of thoroughbreds that make me rich\nNiggas hate me, cause they can't control they roll\nThey see that fat old ass and start givin me cash\n\n[ Hook ]\n\n[ VERSE 3 ]\nMy mind's blown off fine champagne\nSo bent on currency, got green in my vein\nSo damn smooth that every woman wanna touch me\nSo much sexuality that nuns wanna fuck me\nI kick back with my pimpin ballin brothers\nStand over the bed, dump the cash on the covers\nThe game's got me, I'm a slave to the roll\nHoes belong on the track and I belong in gold\nSilk and satin, I deserve a pimpin pattin\nBeen in the life so long cause I stomp bitches who start rattin\nMostly friendly, but do got that gorilla in me\nSave it for the player-hater niggas with the envy\nLot of niggas talk it, but they can't hold a hooker\nIce took her, she was too long a looker\nIt's strictly straight-lace hustlin on mine\nI been pimpin all my life

Gunshot wound to\nThe head. Street violence is at an all-time high)\n\nNo jokin', I'm sleepin' with my eyes open\nWanted for a homicide ride, the gun's still smokin'\nDidn't know what I was doin' but did it anyway\nNow the posse's on my trail, they say I'm gonna pay (Run!)\nI had a gun, it's mine and I packed it\nOut with my crew, the boys caught some static\nMe and this sucker punk went at it\nBang! Nine automatic\n\nHunted Child\nI'm the Hunted Child\n\nVerse 2\n\n(Sources say the assailant was 17-years old and lives in South-Central\nLos Angeles)\n\nNow I'm on a hideout tip cos they're after me\nLAPD says they're gonna capture me\nWas I crazy?

I felt chill, man\nBut once I pulled the trigger, boy, then things got ill, man\nMy homeboys dipped out the back fast\nLeft me alone in the echo of the gun blast\nEverybody saw my face, I didn't wear a mask\nYou wanna know my name?

York's hip hop movement broke loose\nDJ's cut records, raps had the juice\nSince busting rhymes was his natural thing\nHe was crowned the west coast MC king\nBut after his inauguration there was a rush\nOf wack rappers with one intention to crush\nThis master rapper and take his throne\nA simple job,he had no crew, he stood all alone\nAssassins came in groups of one through five\nWith raps no mortal MC could survive\nBut he showed no mercy, he rapped blood thirsty\nBattling from Friday on through to Thursday\nNever losin a bout, never ending in doubt\nEvery confrontation K.O. knock out\nOn

microphone bake it\nRaise the heatin' level, break out your coal shovel\nPump the temp, I'm sweatin' like a devil\nListen to my heartbeat, it's beatin' like a wild man\nBut that's natural, cause you know that I am\nNo punk, no chump, no fool, no toy\nTry to get ill and serve you, boy\n\nI'm on a hype tip, this ain't no ego trip\nJust rollin' thick as hell, champagne I sip as well\nListen and you'll envision, this rap's metabolism\nI think the beat is dope, but it's still your decision\nWhether to turn it on, turn it off\nTurn it up, make it loud, make it soft\nEQ me with new frequencies or\nJust rewind me till the tape bleeds\nMy heartbeat's kickin' like a saturday movie\nSome say it's def, some say it's groovy\nI say it's fly, you know why?\nBecause it's spoken by the brother, whose name is spent with the \"I\"\nThe C-E-T., Cold Chillin' rhyme villain on the M-I-C\nWith raps roarin', I'm never borin', I keep tourin'\nMy record sales keep soarin' and soarin'\nI'll make a million, maybe two\nBuy some rides, gold blow the dough on my crew\nWake up the next morning broke as hell\nBut not for long cause my records sell\n\nMy heartbeat's kickin' like a gun shot\nWhy not?That's who I made it for, the hardrocks\nBetter watch your gold when the posse breaks\nBecause what they want is what they take\nBut I'm coolin', I'm never foolin', too busy rulin'\nSucker emcees who need microphone schoolin'\nLeave'em dazed, dogged, served and droolin'\nBy the playin' punk slayin' mac of microphone duelin'\n\nHeartbeat (scratch freestyle)\n\nThis conglomeration is just a demonstration\nOf rap's penetration to the core of our nation\nSome rappers get down with toy commercial sounds\nI had my choice, I chose the underground\nLike me or hate me, now if you want you can rate me\nMy beat is by ISLAM, the cut's by the great E.\nMy heartbeat is kickin', it's kickin' louder and louder\nIt's gettin' deffer and deffer, I'm feelin' prouder and prouder\nNot robbin' or killin', just mic illin'\nThe phone rings, \"WE MADE ANOTHER MILLION\"\nBreak out the Dom and pop the corks\nCatch a flight to New York\nHit the L.Q. watch RED spin, \"IT'S CLOSED\"\nBrooklyn strikes again\n\nHeartbeat (scratch)\n\nOnce again, my friends, it's time to rock it till the party ends\nRhymin' with timin', while EVIL E lets the record spin\nKickin' it, hittin', rockin', just so dope

like a devil\nListen to my heartbeat, it's beatin' like a wild man\nBut that's natural, cause you know that I am\nNo punk, no chump, no fool, no toy\nTry to get ill and serve you, boy\n\nI'm on a hype tip, this ain't no ego trip\nJust rollin' thick as hell, champagne I sip as well\nListen and you'll envision, this rap's metabolism\nI think the beat is dope, but it's still your decision\nWhether to turn it on, turn it off\nTurn it up, make it loud, make it soft\nEQ me with new frequencies or\nJust rewind me till the tape bleeds\nMy heartbeat's kickin' like a saturday movie\nSome say it's def, some say it's groovy\nI say it's fly, you know why?\nBecause it's spoken by the brother, whose name is spent with the \"I\"\nThe C-E-T., Cold Chillin' rhyme villain on the M-I-C\nWith raps roarin', I'm never borin', I keep tourin'\nMy record sales keep soarin' and soarin'\nI'll make a million, maybe two\nBuy some rides, gold blow the dough on my crew\nWake up the next morning broke as hell\nBut not for long cause my records sell\n\nMy heartbeat's kickin' like a gun shot\nWhy not?That's who I made it for, the hardrocks\nBetter watch your gold when the posse breaks\nBecause what they want is what they take\nBut I'm coolin', I'm never foolin', too busy rulin'\nSucker emcees who need microphone schoolin'\nLeave'em dazed, dogged, served and droolin'\nBy the playin' punk slayin' mac of microphone duelin'\n\nHeartbeat (scratch freestyle)\n\nThis conglomeration is just a demonstration\nOf rap's penetration to the core of our nation\nSome rappers get down with toy commercial sounds\nI had my choice, I chose the underground\nLike me or hate me, now if you want you can rate me\nMy beat is by ISLAM, the cut's by the great E.\nMy heartbeat is kickin', it's kickin' louder and louder\nIt's gettin' deffer and deffer, I'm feelin' prouder and prouder\nNot robbin' or killin', just mic illin'\nThe phone rings, \"WE MADE ANOTHER MILLION\"\nBreak out the Dom and pop the corks\nCatch a flight to New York\nHit the L.Q. watch RED spin, \"IT'S CLOSED\"\nBrooklyn strikes again\n\nHeartbeat (scratch)\n\nOnce again, my friends, it's time to rock it till the party ends\nRhymin' with timin', while EVIL E lets the record spin\nKickin' it, hittin', rockin', just so dope it's shockin'\nBecause I be layin' rhymes super sly, cause this is do or die\nMake it or break it, although most emcees do fake it\nI'll say the ICE can't take it, time to microphone bake it\nRaise the heatin' level, break out your coal shovel\nPump the temp, I'm sweatin' like a devil\nListen

plottin, I'm ill-norm\nTake life forms like light storms I laugh at the wrath\nOf the guys comin on, visions of the antichrist is risen\nThe question is now, am I unforgiven?\n\n\"Legends tells that the creator of this poison's name was Ice\nAlthough, others have told different stories, no matter\nWho or what invented the monster, their souls would be forever\nDamned to Hell\"\n\n(Ice T)\nEnter the death chambre, cash richer, leave ya nutless\nCutless with the raw scope, double ya dope\nFeel my back lash, body cash your whole fam and media\nGreedy shit, tag ya out the rag Jag, speedy shit\nLook in the sky, the four horsemen bustin no discussion\nNo stoppin its apocalypse, lock and load ya clips\nGonna be rich and dead, copa said don't matter cats scatter\nSuckas get touched, niggas get rushed\nWatch em transform into animal form, wicked Hell-born\nLord of the Flies, cry and ya die\nMechanama come masses soul snatcher, fallen angel\nAll angles covered for you fuckin God lovers\nPossession, good suggestion run cuddle your funds\nDouble your guns, watch your kids grow, stay out my flow\nBe wise, the magnificence, evidence, decadence mind\nSeven sins, the abomination, I'm\nThat nigga, last nigga, street mack\nHot is my strap, wet is your back\nUnderstand I never forgive, leavin bodies like seive\nClap gats til my fuckin shit's clipless\nNiggas bear witness\n\n\"Like any deadly disease, it has infected many men\nFrom the east, west, north, and south, gangsta rap is now\nAlive, God forgive me, God forgive me\"", "image":

The ICE will\nAnd once I'm in effect it's overkill\nKinda like a hold-up.all the tickets sold up\nAnd then the black stretch limo cold rolls up\nAnd then the posse breaks,high off the Cold Duck\nAnd

Larceny\n\nPromoters on my tail now\nCause they billed me low\nHere I am 'bout to steal another show\nSo they turn my mic down\nFuck up my audio sound\nBut too late,we just dogged another

Captain\nI would never steal a rap\nBut I'll steal a show in a minute\nIt's as simple as that\nAn interstate crook,my pistol's my rhyme book\nAny show that I'm on is a show that's took\nBetter watch

WORD!!\n\n[Verse One: Ice-T]\nAll punks go for your mothers, today's today\nI'm here to say Warriors come out and play\nRhine for your lives, weak run and hide\nMy name is Ice-T, L.A. is where I reside\nFly as a bird, also awesome unheard\nIf you bite I will take your life, best believe that's word\nFBI's most wanted, but them suckers can't stop\nMean rapping mother, terrorizing Khadafi\nFew tried to match the deaf raps I wrote\nDis my rhyme that's the time, razor meets your throat\nBorn in New Jersey but raised in L.A\nStreets such as hard and the player still play\nFar from a fag, getting paid for my brag\nSo if you wanna come and battle bring a bodybag\nDefinitely deadly and that ain't no Todd -- (LL Cool J)\nAnd if you don't like what I'm saying, we can take it outside\nCause ain't nothing like a squabble cause you know that's fine\nAnd if knife be your reason, then Uzi be mine\nSo all punks get ill cause you know I'm goner\nRhymes that ignite by like a piranha\nIce-T is just rocking the tracks\nAnd Evil E is in the place, just dogging the WAX!!\n\n[Chorus: DJ Flash scratches quotes below]\n\n[Verse Two: Ice-T]\nI love the ladies who were down with the Tee\nBut what I hate and I state is a fool MC\nYou wanna battle the Ice, you gotta be insane\nOne step toward my repping, I inflict the pain\nGot so many raps, I got no place to store them\nGot so many damn pages, I can wallpaper the forum\nAssassination, is my solution\nNo light operation, just massive contusions\nDeaf dealing rhymer with a lust for blood\nConflict with the Master and your name is mud\nI kick it up, no mercy for the fact you're brave\nI'll just bury your butt, then I'll spit on your grave\nLaugh at your family as they stand and cry\nCold smack your mother all in the eye\nCause I'll never get to heaven but you know damn well\nI'll wear Bermuda Shorts while I'm maxing in hell\nSo all suckers step back, reacting the death's attack\nDon't try to ripe me off, just talking like way smack\nBecause I'll leave a shamble, I hustle don't gamble\nAnd I'll rock your butt blind like HBO scramble\nDogging the WAX!!\n\n[Chorus: Dave Storrs]\nWord! this certain general, ?? Tomio, had determined\nThat this sounds you about to hear, will be devastating in your ear\n\n[Verse Three: Ice-T]\nSharp as a razor, down as dirt\nRhyme is my life, party is my work\nL.A. is my place, More Righteous is my base\nSo my lyrics make sense, no words I waste\nChill with the brothers who built the Old School\nRhyme like a rocket, smooths in the pocket\nProgram the 8OA and just lock it\nCrash the Studio with my crew, twenty four tracks mixed down to two\nJam hits the stores, packed kinds of floors\nFreaks in my hotel room by the scores\nThis MC Ice-T, I rock the freaks to ecstasy\nTake them to the T-O-P and bust them out officially\nNever off, always on, rocking to the break of dawn\nLike this, like that, an emcee that's not the whack\nAll the rappers in the game, recognize my name\nThey write off as been lame, or get me credit for my fame\nI'm here to make it clear, eighty six is my year\nI'm the rapper you should fear and I'll have to peer\nSupreme MC Chief, and when I die in my belief\nBattle from L.A. to Rome, rock beyond the thunderdome\nSound hard, know why? it is, don't try\nOnly the top MCs will master this ability\nIf you do, you'll find out what that misword biddly\nOr run that other A to me, for high speed poetry\nTake advice from Ice-T, leave the cuts to Evil E\nGet a girl, feel the bass, write correct for this funky pasta\n\n[Break: DJ Flash displaying Old School turntablizm skills]\n\n[Verse Four: Ice-T]\nI'm dialing M, for murdering fine emcees' heads\nShowing no remorse, reanimating the dead\nKicking dirt in the wombs, turning a wheel in the rap\nI'll make you run for the hills with a streak up your back\nMy rhymes are pigeons, stock cooler than Cold\nBoys always convincing, jewelry solid gold\nMagnified finesse at Hollywood address\nThe perpetrator, cream maker, representing the West\nAvenge is my best friend, homicide is my life\nI write my rhymes in my book with blood on the knife\nNever been beaten in life, never planned to beat\nEither rocked two days straight before I take a breath\nThe rhymes; memorize them like inside my head\nAnd any one who dared bite somehow ends up dead\nGot a license to kill, dogs refusing to chill\nUncut violence is my true thrill\nI'm a hitman kinda sort of, suckers talk in manure\nWith co-cold man known tactics, no man can endure\nNot to be mistaken, when Emcees faking\nAll contracts issued, to Ice-T are taken, with the multitude routes\nYou have no chance to shout\nWith the silencer of a ninja, your lights are out\nGirls cry to sight, some in Latin fight\nFor the posal positions at my jam each night\nThe player from L.A. cooler than any Jay -- (LL Cool J)\nMy name is Ice-T, I make the Mafia Pay\nDogging the wax!!\n\n[Outro: DJ Flash]\nNot bad y'all!!\nNot bad at all!!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e3a7b5ac9c57bd99fd7ec21e1381bdbf.600x600x1.jpg", "artist": "Ice-T", "raw": {"annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/2224612", "apple_music_id": null,

WORD!!\n\n[Verse One: Ice-T]\nAll punks go for your mothers, today's today\nI'm here to say Warriors come out and play\nRhine for your lives, weak run and hide\nMy name is Ice-T, L.A. is where I reside\nFly as a bird, also awesome unheard\nIf you bite I will take your life, best believe that's word\nFBI's most wanted, but them suckers can't stop\nMean rapping mother, terrorizing Khadafi\nFew tried to match the deaf raps I wrote\nDis my rhyme that's the time, razor meets your throat\nBorn in New Jersey but raised in L.A\nStreets such as hard and the player still play\nFar from a fag, getting paid for my brag\nSo if you wanna come and battle bring a bodybag\nDefinitely deadly and that ain't no Todd -- (LL Cool J)\nAnd if you don't like what I'm saying, we can take it outside\nCause ain't nothing like a squabble cause you know that's fine\nAnd if knife be your reason, then Uzi be mine\nSo all punks get ill cause you know I'm goner\nRhymes that ignite by like a piranha\nIce-T is just rocking the tracks\nAnd Evil E is in the place, just dogging the WAX!!\n\n[Chorus: DJ Flash scratches quotes below]\n\n[Verse Two: Ice-T]\nI love the ladies who were down with the Tee\nBut what I hate and I state is a fool MC\nYou wanna battle the Ice, you gotta be insane\nOne step toward my repping, I inflict the pain\nGot so many raps, I got no place to store them\nGot so many damn pages, I can wallpaper the forum\nAssassination, is my solution\nNo light operation, just massive contusions\nDeaf dealing rhymer with a lust for blood\nConflict with the Master and your name is mud\nI kick it up, no mercy for the fact you're brave\nI'll just bury your butt, then I'll spit on your grave\nLaugh at your family as they stand and cry\nCold smack your mother all in the eye\nCause I'll never get to heaven but you know damn well\nI'll wear Bermuda Shorts while I'm maxing in hell\nSo all suckers step back, reacting the death's attack\nDon't try to ripe me off, just talking like way smack\nBecause I'll leave a shamble, I hustle don't gamble\nAnd I'll rock your butt blind like HBO scramble\nDogging the WAX!!\n\n[Chorus: Dave Storrs]\nWord! this certain general, ?? Tomio, had determined\nThat this sounds you about to hear, will be devastating in your ear\n\n[Verse Three: Ice-T]\nSharp as a razor, down as dirt\nRhyme is my life, party is my work\nL.A. is my place, More Righteous is my base\nSo my lyrics make sense, no words I waste\nChill with the brothers who built the Old School\nRhyme like a rocket, smooths in the pocket\nProgram the 8OA and just lock it\nCrash the Studio with my crew, twenty four tracks mixed down to two\nJam hits the stores, packed kinds of floors\nFreaks in my hotel room by the scores\nThis MC Ice-T, I rock the freaks to ecstasy\nTake them to the T-O-P and bust them out officially\nNever off, always on, rocking to the break of dawn\nLike this, like that, an emcee that's not the whack\nAll the rappers in the game, recognize my name\nThey write off as been lame, or get me credit for my fame\nI'm here to make it clear, eighty six is my year\nI'm the rapper you should fear and I'll have to peer\nSupreme MC Chief, and when I die in my belief\nBattle from L.A. to Rome, rock beyond the thunderdome\nSound hard, know why? it is, don't try\nOnly the top MCs will master this ability\nIf you do, you'll find out what that misword biddly\nOr run that other A to me, for high speed poetry\nTake advice from Ice-T, leave the cuts to Evil E\nGet a girl, feel the bass, write correct for this funky pasta\n\n[Break: DJ Flash displaying Old School turntablizm skills]\n\n[Verse Four: Ice-T]\nI'm dialing M, for murdering fine emcees' heads\nShowing no remorse, reanimating the dead\nKicking dirt in the wombs, turning a wheel in the rap\nI'll make you run for the hills with a streak up your back\nMy rhymes are pigeons, stock cooler than Cold\nBoys always convincing, jewelry solid gold\nMagnified finesse at Hollywood address\nThe perpetrator, cream maker, representing the West\nAvenge is my best friend, homicide is my life\nI write my rhymes in my book with blood on the knife\nNever been beaten in life, never planned to beat\nEither rocked two days straight before I take a breath\nThe rhymes; memorize them like inside my head\nAnd any one who dared bite somehow ends up dead\nGot a license to kill, dogs refusing to chill\nUncut violence is my true thrill\nI'm a hitman kinda sort of, suckers talk in manure\nWith co-cold man known tactics, no man can endure\nNot to be mistaken, when Emcees faking\nAll contracts issued, to Ice-T are taken, with the multitude routes\nYou have no chance to shout\nWith the silencer of a ninja, your lights are out\nGirls cry to sight, some in Latin fight\nFor the posal positions at my jam each night\nThe player from L.A. cooler than any Jay -- (LL Cool J)\nMy name is Ice-T, I make the Mafia Pay\nDogging the wax!!\n\n[Outro: DJ Flash]\nNot bad y'all!!\nNot bad at all!!"}}, {"title": "Valuable Game", "album": "The Seventh Deadly Sin", "year": null, "lyrics": "(Intro: Ice-T)\nThis song is dedicated to my man 2Pac Shakur, rest in peace!!\nNotorious B.I.G., rest in peace!!\nAnd all my other homies that have died\nIn the madness called street life\nRest in peace!!\n\n(Chorus)\nI'mma straight up G, let's not pretend\nDedicated to, all of my friends\nOn the East and the West Coast\nGotta let this drama go\n\n(Ice-T)\nNineteen eighty six, deep in the mix\nMe and my team out for cream and jewel-liks\nThe faster, the better, blood, leather, the baby sledge\nCase hitters - me, I'm the point man\nGive less than a damn about anything, just let my hammer swing\nCome up, give me my cut - what?\nGirls don't mean nothin' to me, don't push the button on me\nOut for the twist, ya nastically nasty G\nBasically makin' me anti-social individual, too hype\nRecognize the type?\nThen a music called hip-hop came along and saved my life\nI had a story to tell about my knowledge of hell\n$2.50 for a book, listen and look, now let's do some Math\nA gun and a hand, plus an angry man, minus love\nEquals and me, the sky's blue and they rags\nToe-tags and body bags - y'all feel me?\nIs it too real G?

power in effect\nWhile you two rednecks waitin' to see which one of us\nKills the next brother next\nThink about it too long'll make you sick\nBelieve me the last thing they wanna see is us risin'\nEconomically, astronomically it could happen homie - follow me\nHip-hop's the black goal - mind and soul\nRefined as we roll, another ghetto story is told\nI stopped flippin' ki's in eighty

steak\nI'm tryin' to eat from the players elite\nEast, West, North, South, Moon, Star\nI'm gonna ball wherever the chips are\nI hope y'all players listen, ain't out there hatin' and dissin'\nY'all

this\n\n(Chorus)\nI'mma straight up G, let's not pretend\nDedicated to, all of my friends\nOn the East and the West Coast\nGotta let this drama go\n\n(Ice-T)\nSome nights I lay awake tryin' to analyse\nAnd anticipate the moves of the fakes\nWonder if the cancers' in too deep - can't sleep\nTryin' to diagnose the poison that's increased\nInjected into a pure hustle born on city streak\nMigranes fill my brain as I reach toward the realm of the insane\nWishin' and prayin' that another brother gets\nTo live the life that I got to play in\nTryin' to represent to the fullest\nI gotta come hard y'all, no time to pull it\nY'all fools think illin' and tearin' up\nHip-hop is the thing to do G?\nI'm paid I don't need rap no more fool I make a movie\nY'all tryin' to lose me\nAnd to y'all suckers with your afrobatic, player hatin' tatics\nTryin' to jump over the bree and plannin' and hustlin'\nI've been corporatin' to this music over these years\nY'all will fall victim to your own lies and the P.I\nWill continue to rise, over your eyes kid\nThis games' immaculate, dramas' irrelevant - stay sucker reppellin'\nInvent, incoporate, parlay, play\nAnd I got no reason to lie to you\n\n(Chorus)\nI'mma straight up G, let's not pretend\nDedicated to, all of my friends\nOn the East and the West Coast\nGotta let this drama go\nI'mma straight up G, let's not pretend\nDedicated to,

to, all of my friends\nOn the East and the West Coast\nGotta let this drama go\n\n(Ice-T)\nNineteen eighty six, deep in the mix\nMe and my team out for cream and jewel-liks\nThe faster, the better, blood, leather, the baby sledge\nCase hitters - me, I'm the point man\nGive less than a damn about anything, just let my hammer swing\nCome up, give me my cut - what?\nGirls don't mean nothin' to me, don't push the button on me\nOut for the twist, ya nastically nasty G\nBasically makin' me anti-social individual, too hype\nRecognize the type?\nThen a music called hip-hop came along and saved my life\nI had a story to tell about my knowledge of hell\n$2.50 for a book, listen and look, now let's do some Math\nA gun and a hand, plus an angry man, minus love\nEquals and me, the sky's blue and they rags\nToe-tags and body bags - y'all feel me?\nIs it too real G? Brothers say drop some heat T\nAbsoultely, everything's goochie since we realized\nThis games' the only one we got left\nHip-hop's become the game of death\nSome of y'all busters out there tryin' to waste up\nIt would've took some of us hustlers all this time to lace up\n\n(Chorus)\nI'mma straight up G, let's not pretend\nDedicated to, all of my friends\nOn the East and the West Coast\nGotta let this drama go\n\n(Ice-T)\nOk, let me break it down, they got the one strike law\nYou go in, you reach the other two before you know\nWhat happen to you - game's over dude\nOn the next page, they got power in effect\nWhile you two rednecks waitin' to see which one of us\nKills the next brother next\nThink about it too long'll make you sick\nBelieve me the last thing they wanna see is us risin'\nEconomically, astronomically it could happen homie - follow me\nHip-hop's the black goal - mind and soul\nRefined as we roll, another ghetto story is told\nI stopped flippin' ki's in eighty three\nThey need a time machine to carcerate me\nI'm square as a pool table, twice as green, know what I mean?\nFlippin' from heat, the legal green, the hip-hop scene\nBeef, the only beef I got is the steak\nI'm tryin' to eat from the players elite\nEast, West, North, South, Moon, Star\nI'm gonna ball wherever the chips are\nI hope y'all players listen, ain't out there hatin' and dissin'\nY'all know the game is to be sold and not told\nI should be takin' a collection, this time I'll make an exception\nI've just been here for the start of this\nI gotta come from the heart for this\n\n(Chorus)\nI'mma straight up G, let's not pretend\nDedicated to, all of my friends\nOn the East and the West Coast\nGotta let this drama go\n\n(Ice-T)\nSome nights I lay awake tryin' to analyse\nAnd anticipate the moves of the fakes\nWonder if the cancers' in too deep - can't sleep\nTryin' to diagnose the poison that's increased\nInjected into a pure hustle born on city streak\nMigranes fill my brain as I reach toward the realm of the insane\nWishin' and prayin' that another brother gets\nTo live the life that I got to play in\nTryin' to represent to the fullest\nI gotta come hard y'all, no time to pull it\nY'all fools think illin' and tearin' up\nHip-hop is the thing to do G?\nI'm paid I don't need rap no more fool I make a movie\nY'all tryin' to lose me\nAnd to y'all suckers with your afrobatic, player hatin' tatics\nTryin' to jump over the bree and plannin' and hustlin'\nI've been corporatin' to this music over these years\nY'all will fall victim to your own lies and the P.I\nWill continue to rise, over your eyes kid\nThis games' immaculate, dramas' irrelevant - stay sucker reppellin'\nInvent, incoporate, parlay, play\nAnd I got no reason to lie to you\n\n(Chorus)\nI'mma straight up G, let's not pretend\nDedicated to, all of my friends\nOn the East and the West Coast\nGotta let this drama go\nI'mma straight up G, let's not pretend\nDedicated to, all of my friends\nOn the East and the West Coast\nGotta let this drama go\n\n------------------------------------------------------------"}}], "artist": "Ice-T"}
