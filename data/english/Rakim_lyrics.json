this, and cash in this\nMastered this, flash this and make 'em clap to this\nDJ's throw on cuts and obey the crowd\nJust pump the volume up, and play it loud\nHip-hop's embedded, before I said I wouldn't let it\nBut me and the microphone is still magnetic\nStraight off the top, I knew I'd be forced to rock\nDancefloors just stop, the spot's scorchin' hot\nHopin' I open Rakim Allah seminars\nMassage at the bar smokin' ten dollar cigars\nWhile I admire midas, with more vision than TV's\nI find it easy catchin' diabetes from fly sweeties\nSit back and wait to hear a slammin' track\nRockin' jams by popular demand, I'm back\n\n[Hook]\nI control the crowd, you know I hold it down\nWhen it drop, you know it's jiggy\nWhen you hear the sound\nFrom town to town, until it's world-renowned\nAnd I rock New York City all year around\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt's on, so you can swerve when it's heard in clubs\nThought patterns displayed on Persian rugs\nEquations are drawn up in paisley form\nMic, it stay warm, my flow is Evian\nDeep as a Nautilus, you stay dipped in Ra's style\nFrom the shores of Long Island to Panama Canal\nIntellect pitches, new trends, like a clothes designer\nI'm in effect, quicker than medicines in China\nSplit the mic open, fill it with somethin' potent to go in\nAnd take a toke then, mental planes start floatin'\nHot science is smokin', altitudes cause chokin'\nProduct is hypnotic, you're soakin' and still smokin'\nShowin' better scenes than grams of amphetamines\nPlans to scheme, means I'll forever fiend\nLong as the mic is loud and the volume's pumpin'\nI'ma move crowds to two-thousand and somethin'\n\n[Hook]\nI control the crowd, you know I hold it down\nWhen it drop, you know it's jiggy\nWhen you hear the sound\nFrom town to town, until it's world-renowned\nAnd I rock New York City all year around\n\n[Verse 3]\nYo, my rhymes and lyrics find spirits like a seance\nSince fat crayons, I write and display chaos\nMy plan is damage, the diagram to where the jam is\nI take advantage until the crowd go bananas\nWhat a rush! I hear cuts, then I lust to touch\nMicrophones get clutched by the illustrious\nWord spread I inherited, many ways to say the unsaid\nBorn with three 7's in my head\nIn time no one can seem to blow your mind as far as this\nTo find you'll need philosophers and anthropologists\nAstrologists, professors from your smartest colleges\nWith knowledge of scholarships, when Ra be droppin' this\nSome of the things that I know will be in your next bible\nWhen I die, go bury me and my notebook in Cairo\nWith the great God from Egypt, manifest was write rhymes\nAlign with the stars, I come back to bless the mic\n\n[Hook]\nI control the crowd, you know I hold it down\nWhen it drop, you know it's jiggy\nWhen you hear the sound\nFrom town to town, until it's world-renowned\nAnd I rock New York City all year around\n\nI control the crowd, you know I hold it down\nWhen it drop, you know it's jiggy\nWhen you hear the sound\nFrom town to town, until it's world-renowned\nAnd I rock New York City all year around\n\n[Outro]\nOnce again, back is the incredible\nWord up, Rakim Allah the Microphone Fiend is back\nYaknahmean? (Rakim Allah!)\nTil' death do us part, it's on\nOnce again, back is the incredible (Rakim Allah!)\nOnce again, back is the incredible (Rakim Allah!)\nOnce again, back is the incredible (Rakim Allah!)\nOnce again, back is the incredible (Rakim Allah!)\nOnce again, back is the incredible (Rakim Allah!)\nOnce again, back is the incredible (Rakim Allah!)\nOnce again, back is the incredible (Rakim Allah!)\nOnce again, back is the incredible (Rakim Allah!)\nOnce again, back is the incredible (Rakim Allah!)\nOnce again, back is the incredible (Rakim Allah!)\nOnce again back is the incredible\nThe incredible, the incredible, the incredible\nOnce again, back is the incredible\nRhyme animal, the incredible"}}, {"title": "Mystery (Who Is God)", "album": "The 18th Letter", "year":

God?)\n\n[Verse 1]\nIn eternal blackness, in the midst of the darkest night\nProteins and minerals, exist within specks of light\nSolids liquids and gases, and sparks of light within\nInfinite lengths and widths and depths and heights\nNo beginning or ending, the seven dimensions\nEnough space for more than a million words and inventions\nTo travel through time within enough room to be the womb\nOf the most high's great mind which he will soon make shine\nWith intelligent elements in sight that he will gather\nIn the realms of relativity electricity struck matter\nEnergies explode he reload to keep releasing\nAtoms by the millions, til the numbers increasing\n'Til it was burning he kept returning itself to the source\nThe hotter his thoughts it gave the center more force\nHe gave birth to the sun which would follow his laws\nAll caused by his mental intercourse, who is God?\n\n[Hook]\nIf you can see if you can solve the mystery\nThe answer revolves around your history\nSo carefully, I drop this degree\nScientifically, and realistically (Who is God?)\n\n[Verse 2]\nHe began to explain his craft, the master in the attic\nHe dealt with measurements his language, was mathematics\nHis theoretical wisdom of the numerical system\nThe complete number nine which means born or existed\nHe gave birth to all planets, inorganic, and organic\nSo you wouldn't take it for granted\nThey rotated they own distance around the sun\nAnd fully submit to the existance of one\nAnd each one was promised everlasting perfection\nIf each one keeps spinnin in the same direction\nTo the East, and each speak the motion of peace\nAnd harmony, and each show devotion to teach\nThe universe is to come, the whole world must go according\nKnow your galaxies and mirages stars start fallin\nSo stay in your orbit maintain safe and sound\nLike the planets each cipher remains perfectly round\n\n[Hook]\nIf you can see if you can solve the mystery\nThe answer revolves around your history\nSo carefully, I drop this degree\nScientifically, and realistically (Who is God?)\n\n[Verse 3]\nFrom unconciousness, to conciousness\nBy knowledging his wisdom his response is this\nA understanding, which is the best part\nHe picked the third planet where new forms of life would start\nHe pursued show and prove every move in order\nBack to the source he let off his resources in the water\nClimb his climax, where the climate is at, high degrees\nSee he start to breathe deep in the darkest seas\nAnd the plan is, to lay in the clays to form land\nAnd expand, usin the same clays to born man\nIn his own image our origin begins in the East\nCulture rise to breed, with the powers of peace\nDeal in equality nature's policy is to be God\nBuild or destroy positively born life like Allah\nAnd each one was given everlasting perfection\nIf each one keep living in the same direction\nAnd life was life, and love was love\nWe went according by the laws of the world above\nThey showed us physically, we could reach infinity\nBut mentally, through the century we lost our identity\nLife start and ending, we got trife and started sinning\nLost touch with the beginning now ciphers stop spinnin\nAnd what was once easy became confused and hard\nWhich brings us back, to the mystic question, who is God?\nSixty-six trillion years since his face was shown\nWhen the seventh angel appears, the mystery will be known\nCheck Revelations and Genesis, St. Luke and John\nIt even tells us we are Gods in the Holy Qu'ran\nWisdom Strength and Beauty, one of the meanings of God\nG.O.D. you and me Gomar Oz Dubar\nKnowledge Wisdom Understanding Sun Moon and Star\nMan Woman and Child, and so is Allah\n\n[Hook]\nIf you can see if you can solve the mystery\nThe answer revolves around your history\nSo carefully, I drop this degree\nScientifically, and realistically (Who is God?)\n\n[Outro]\nBear witness to Allah, gave birth to all\nFor Allah was all, and therefore, life itself\nAnd the universe gave birth to man\nThe universe was man, and man was the universe\nAnd the universe was always existed\nAnd existance was life\nAnd life is Allah\nAnd Allah had no beginning because he is, what always was\nRakim Allah, peace\nNow who is God?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/623e8b053d42f096f389fcd0d63e9f2c.950x950x1.jpg", "artist": "Rakim", "raw": {"annotation_count": 48, "api_path":

specks of light\nSolids liquids and gases, and sparks of light within\nInfinite lengths and widths and depths and heights\nNo beginning or ending, the seven dimensions\nEnough space for more than a million words and inventions\nTo travel through time within enough room to be the womb\nOf the most high's great mind which he will soon make shine\nWith intelligent elements in sight that he will gather\nIn the realms of relativity electricity struck matter\nEnergies explode he reload to keep releasing\nAtoms by the millions, til the numbers increasing\n'Til it was burning he kept returning itself to the source\nThe hotter his thoughts it gave the center more force\nHe gave birth to the sun which would follow his laws\nAll caused by his mental intercourse, who is God?\n\n[Hook]\nIf you can see if you can solve the mystery\nThe answer revolves around your history\nSo carefully, I drop this degree\nScientifically, and realistically (Who is God?)\n\n[Verse 2]\nHe began to explain his craft, the master in the attic\nHe dealt with measurements his language, was mathematics\nHis theoretical wisdom of the numerical system\nThe complete number nine which means born or existed\nHe gave birth to all planets, inorganic, and organic\nSo you wouldn't take it for granted\nThey rotated they own distance around the sun\nAnd fully submit to the existance of one\nAnd each one was promised everlasting perfection\nIf each one keeps spinnin in the same direction\nTo the East, and each speak the motion of peace\nAnd harmony, and each show devotion to teach\nThe universe is to come, the whole world must go according\nKnow your galaxies and mirages stars start fallin\nSo stay in your orbit maintain safe and sound\nLike the planets each cipher remains perfectly round\n\n[Hook]\nIf you can see if you can solve the mystery\nThe answer revolves around your history\nSo carefully, I drop this degree\nScientifically, and realistically (Who is God?)\n\n[Verse 3]\nFrom unconciousness, to conciousness\nBy knowledging his wisdom his response is this\nA understanding, which is the best part\nHe picked the third planet where new forms of life would start\nHe pursued show and prove every move in order\nBack to the source he let off his resources in the water\nClimb his climax, where the climate is at, high degrees\nSee he start to breathe deep in the darkest seas\nAnd the plan is, to lay in the clays to form land\nAnd expand, usin the same clays to born man\nIn his own image our origin begins in the East\nCulture rise to breed, with the powers of peace\nDeal in equality nature's policy is to be God\nBuild or destroy positively born life like Allah\nAnd each one was given everlasting perfection\nIf each one keep living in the same direction\nAnd life was life, and love was love\nWe went according by the laws of the world above\nThey showed us physically, we could reach infinity\nBut mentally, through the century we lost our identity\nLife start and ending, we got trife and started sinning\nLost touch with the beginning now ciphers stop spinnin\nAnd what was once easy became confused and hard\nWhich brings us back, to the mystic question, who is God?\nSixty-six trillion years since his face was shown\nWhen the seventh angel appears, the mystery will be known\nCheck Revelations and Genesis, St. Luke and John\nIt even tells us we are Gods in the Holy Qu'ran\nWisdom Strength and Beauty, one of the meanings of God\nG.O.D. you and me Gomar Oz Dubar\nKnowledge Wisdom Understanding Sun Moon and Star\nMan Woman and Child, and so is Allah\n\n[Hook]\nIf you can see if you can solve the mystery\nThe answer revolves around your history\nSo carefully, I drop this degree\nScientifically, and realistically (Who is God?)\n\n[Outro]\nBear witness to Allah, gave birth to all\nFor Allah was all, and therefore, life itself\nAnd the universe gave birth to man\nThe universe was man, and man was the universe\nAnd the universe was always existed\nAnd existance was life\nAnd life is Allah\nAnd Allah had no beginning because he is, what always was\nRakim Allah, peace\nNow who is God?"}}, {"title": "R.A.K.I.M.", "album": "8 Mile: Music from and Inspired by the

unexplained for the brains 'til things change\nThey strain to sling slang, I'm trained to bring game\nHistory that I arranged been regained by King James\nGo to practice, with tactics, when the track hits, theatrics\nWomen that look like actress the status of Cleopatra's\nStacks of mathematics to feed yo-asiatics\nAs I find out, what the facts is, for geographic\nNo time to sip Mo's with hostess, never mind what the total gross is\nI rip shows, stay focused, and split cheese, with soldiers\nWhile you hit trees and coast I spit flows that be ferocious\nAnd with these explosives, I split seas for Moses\nShine permanently only my mind's concernin me\nFire burns in me eternally time's eternity\nFollowers turn on me they'll be in a mental infirmary\nDeterminedly advance technology better than Germany\nSince the first days you know of, till the last days is over\nI was always the flow-er, I made waves for Noah\nFrom a compound, to the anatomy, to the breakdown of a atom\nSome of my rap patterns, still surround Saturn\nFrom the ancient hieroglyphics, to graffiti painted pictures\nI study I know the scriptures but nowaday ain't it vicious\nDate back I go beyond, check the holy Qu'ran\nTo speeches at the Audobon, now we get our party on\nSo being benificent, I bless em with dialogue\nThey expectin the next testament, by the God\nI roam through battlezones with chrome for chaperone\nBlast beat with saxophones one of the baddest rappers known\nEvery country city and borough, sidestreet and ghetto\nIsle and alley and meadow, theories thorough enough to echo\nWhen it was one mass of land, with one nash' of man\nAnd the whole mass was ran under one master plan\nSince the world's metamorphis, and the plan is kept in orbit\nTurntables we spin awkward but needles never skip off it\nRhythms we expressin similar to our ancestors\nIt'll answer your questions if you understand the message\nFrom the days of the slave choppers, to the new age of prophets\nAs heavy as

I'm trained to bring game\nHistory that I arranged been regained by King James\nGo to practice, with tactics, when the track hits, theatrics\nWomen that look like actress the status of Cleopatra's\nStacks of mathematics to feed yo-asiatics\nAs I find out, what the facts is, for geographic\nNo time to sip Mo's with hostess, never mind what the total gross is\nI rip shows, stay focused, and split cheese, with soldiers\nWhile you hit trees and coast I spit flows that be ferocious\nAnd with these explosives, I split seas for Moses\nShine permanently only my mind's concernin me\nFire burns in me eternally time's eternity\nFollowers turn on me they'll be in a mental infirmary\nDeterminedly advance technology better than Germany\nSince the first days you know of, till the last days is over\nI was always the flow-er, I made waves for Noah\nFrom a compound, to the anatomy, to the breakdown of a atom\nSome of my rap patterns, still surround Saturn\nFrom the ancient hieroglyphics, to graffiti painted pictures\nI study I know the scriptures but nowaday ain't it vicious\nDate back I go beyond, check the holy Qu'ran\nTo speeches at the Audobon, now we get our party on\nSo being benificent, I bless em with dialogue\nThey expectin the next testament, by the God\nI roam through battlezones with chrome for chaperone\nBlast beat with saxophones one of the baddest rappers known\nEvery country city and borough, sidestreet and ghetto\nIsle and alley and meadow, theories thorough enough to echo\nWhen it was one mass of land, with one nash' of man\nAnd the whole mass was ran under one master plan\nSince the world's metamorphis, and the plan is kept in orbit\nTurntables we spin awkward but needles never skip off it\nRhythms we expressin similar to our ancestors\nIt'll answer your questions if you understand the message\nFrom the days of the slave choppers, to the new age of prophets\nAs heavy as hip-hop is I'm always ready to drop it\nFrom the mind which is one of Allah's best designs\nAnd mines'll stand the test of time, when I rhyme\n\n[Hook]\nThe 18th Letter, the prophecy professor\nI stay clever, long as the planet stay together\nBring up praise from Mecca, make a phrase for the better\nIn new days to remember, always and forever\n\n[Outro]\nThe R baby"}}, {"title": "Holy Are You", "album": "The Seventh Seal", "year": "2009-11-17",

the God MC the lyricist\nTrace this down to the roots from Genesis\nThe world wonder, I'm still standing like pyramids\nDesign so vivid, every brick it got a story to tell\nMy rhyme flow different like a hieroglyphic\nMind prolific, infinite, like mathematic\nThe first language, now add that and add graphics\nThen go let the blocks know it's the gospel\nLife's new manual so watch close\nThe new Michelangelo and Pablo Picasso\nPrepared to show you the cosmos and rock flows\nEven my lyrical metaphysical\nWhat this'll do is help you get to your spiritual pinnacle\nYou find your mind too far-fetched for it to fathom\nI bring the darkness to the light, split the atom\nIt's like watching the big bang theory emerge\nI take titles, bond them to reveal new words\nThey want a clear view\nFrom the farthest and the darkest corners of the universe\nTo a corner near you\nA pharaoh in ghetto apparel, stay blinged up\nFort Knox display, a modern day King Tut\nWrapped tight, rap like I've been preserved in time\nSpit the holy water, then touch it and turn it to wine\nIt's the God\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe were children of the most high, so we fell\nFrom paradise to holy hell\nProbably descendants of the Holy Grail\nAnother part of history they won't reveal\nTimes'll only tell\nYou waiting for Judgment? It came\nIn the form of a thug in the game\nTo create a strong position, there's blood in my vein\nThe chemical is identical, we one and the same\nWith seven letters in all three of my government names\nWalk on water?

the God MC the lyricist\nTrace this down to the roots from Genesis\nThe world wonder, I'm still standing like pyramids\nDesign so vivid, every brick it got a story to tell\nMy rhyme flow different like a hieroglyphic\nMind prolific, infinite, like mathematic\nThe first language, now add that and add graphics\nThen go let the blocks know it's the gospel\nLife's new manual so watch close\nThe new Michelangelo and Pablo Picasso\nPrepared to show you the cosmos and rock flows\nEven my lyrical metaphysical\nWhat this'll do is help you get to your spiritual pinnacle\nYou find your mind too far-fetched for it to fathom\nI bring the darkness to the light, split the atom\nIt's like watching the big bang theory emerge\nI take titles, bond them to reveal new words\nThey want a clear view\nFrom the farthest and the darkest corners of the universe\nTo a corner near you\nA pharaoh in ghetto apparel, stay blinged up\nFort Knox display, a modern day King Tut\nWrapped tight, rap like I've been preserved in time\nSpit the holy water, then touch it and turn it to wine\nIt's the God\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe were children of the most high, so we fell\nFrom paradise to holy hell\nProbably descendants of the Holy Grail\nAnother part of history they won't reveal\nTimes'll only tell\nYou waiting for Judgment?

From the slums of New York, to the gutters all over the world\nThis is for y'all....\n\n[Verse 1]\nThrough my travels I try to take righteous steps\nBecause right or left could mean life or death\nNo matter how trife it get, my sights is set\nBut it's twice the threat when the nights is death\nMy mental windows refuse to close, they get exposed\nTo the neighborhood info where the poison wind blows\nA deadly plague spreadin' negativity, viciously\nUnto every city be in ghetto misery\nDon't let it get to me, the writer be left to die\nBut it get mesmerize if it catch your eye\nShines enormous, from pure revered Kool's and garments\nBut it's torment, jealousy drug wars or warring\nTallying, slowly turnin' into barbarians\nMore scary when the whole boulevard's carryin'\nLivin' in the world of sin, my ghetto girls and men\nWaiting for the world to end\n\n[Hook]\n\"Tryin to paint a perfect picture and excel\"\n\"In case you didn't know\"\n\"Never movin' backwards\"\n\"Complicated\"\n\"Know what I mean?\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nI see destruction, even little kids trust none\nThey bust guns, that's what they get a rush from\nWhen I see 'em, we build and have a real discussion\n\"Yo Ra, what's the jewel of the day?\" \"What up, son\"\n\"You got ambition?\" Shorty said, \"Man listen\n\"I got demands for livin, can't stand division\n\"Make grands on my

me by\"\nSo I asked him why, with a fast reply\nHe said \"I'm livin just to die without any feelings\nSo I wait here for my maker till it's time to go\nWith this dime I know, with all of her girls and

beginning to end, in it to win\nEvil rebels, doin' what we doin' in the ghetto\nThinkin' if we was thorough we can deceive the devil\nYou can't win, your life be end, try again\nShorty said, \"Why we born again to die again?\"\nThat's what I said when I realized I had a gift\nTo uplift and be one of Allah's advocates\nTeach the youth and speak the truth\nShow 'em what peace can do when they'll reach for you\nAnd my reward won't be jewels or cheese, it's even better\nI can be one of the greatest MC's ever\nIf I tell 'em they intelligent women and great men\nAnd live, stop waitin' for the world to end\n\n[Hook]\n\"Tryin to paint a perfect picture and excel\"\n\"In case you didn't know\"\n\"Never movin' backwards\"\n\"Complicated\"\n\"Know what I mean?\"\n\"I'm ragin, rippin up the

From the slums of New York, to the gutters all over the world\nThis is for y'all....\n\n[Verse 1]\nThrough my travels I try to take righteous steps\nBecause right or left could mean life or death\nNo matter how trife it get, my sights is set\nBut it's twice the threat when the nights is death\nMy mental windows refuse to close, they get exposed\nTo the neighborhood info where the poison wind blows\nA deadly plague spreadin' negativity, viciously\nUnto every city be in ghetto misery\nDon't let it get to me, the writer be left to die\nBut it get mesmerize if it catch your eye\nShines enormous, from pure revered Kool's and garments\nBut it's torment, jealousy drug wars or warring\nTallying, slowly turnin' into barbarians\nMore scary when the whole boulevard's carryin'\nLivin' in the world of sin, my ghetto girls and men\nWaiting for the world to end\n\n[Hook]\n\"Tryin to paint a perfect picture and excel\"\n\"In case you didn't know\"\n\"Never movin' backwards\"\n\"Complicated\"\n\"Know what I mean?\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nI see destruction, even little kids trust none\nThey bust guns, that's what they get a rush from\nWhen I see 'em, we build and have a real discussion\n\"Yo Ra, what's the jewel of the day?\" \"What up, son\"\n\"You got ambition?\" Shorty said, \"Man listen\n\"I got demands for livin, can't stand division\n\"Make grands on my mission, 'til everything glisten\n\"Women in the Expedition, no plans for prison\n\"In a vision the city get, 2 milleni G\n\"Sittin' in my embassy, sippin' Hennesy\n\"Gettin' high, and watch life pass me by\"\nSo I asked him why, with a fast reply\nHe said \"I'm livin just to die without any feelings\nSo I wait here for my maker till it's time to go\nWith this dime I know, with all of her girls and all of my men\nWaiting for the world to end\"\n\n[Hook]\n\"Tryin to paint a perfect picture and excel\"\n\"In case you didn't know\"\n\"Never movin' backwards\"\n\"Complicated\"\n\"Know what I mean?\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nShorty was taught to keep his head to the sky, and never cry\nBut the streets left him to die, now it's death in his eye\nLivin' a sin of hitmen, a sinister grin\nFrom the beginning to end, in it to win\nEvil rebels, doin' what we doin' in the ghetto\nThinkin' if we was thorough we can deceive the devil\nYou can't win, your life be end, try again\nShorty said, \"Why we born again to die again?\"\nThat's what I said when I realized I had a gift\nTo uplift and be one of Allah's advocates\nTeach the youth and speak the truth\nShow 'em what peace can do when they'll reach for you\nAnd my reward won't be jewels or cheese, it's even better\nI can be one of the greatest MC's ever\nIf I tell 'em they intelligent women and great men\nAnd live, stop waitin' for the world to end\n\n[Hook]\n\"Tryin to paint a perfect picture and excel\"\n\"In case you didn't know\"\n\"Never movin' backwards\"\n\"Complicated\"\n\"Know what I mean?\"\n\"I'm ragin, rippin up the stage an'\nDon't it sound amazin, know what I mean?\"\n\"Don't it sound amazin, know what I mean?\"\n\"Rakim\""}}, {"title": "Don't Call Me", "album": "Don't Call Me", "year": "2013-09-24", "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Rakim]\nI idolized my father\nHe taught me to survive the horror\nCause times is harder, the skies is darker\nLook through the eyes of a snake, see inside the monster\nTo rise need divide and conquer\nIf it's all about money I don't respect your power, that's weak\nThey deprive and devour, they cowards if you ask me\nPowers that be mistreat us, mislead us\nThinking eventually we gone bite the hand that feed us\nWe son 'em and try to keep all other from 'em\nNovus ordo seclorum, E pluribus unum\nNew order of the ages, out of many: one\nWhile the rest of us is conned out of pennies: none\nI'm starving, it's problems if we ain't fed quickly\nMy breads use to be the ones taking heads with me\nJealousy, hate, lust and greed is spread quickly\nDon't call me brother if you ain't breaking bread with me\n\n[Hook: Shontelle]\nDon't call me mother\nDon't call me sister\nDon't call me brother\nDon't call me father\n\n[Verse 2: DMX]\nDon't call me brother, we ain't got the same mother\nOr the same father you get down like the other\nDon't speak on wisdom when you know you don't love her\nDon't shake my hand when you wanna see me under\nDon't talk slick behind my back\nDon't walk like this when you act like that\nWhat you trying to bark for when you let you a cat\nCome to your hood like ''brrap, brrap, brrap''\nMess with the kid if you want to\nCause your mans and them to tell you\nIt'll be the last thing that you going through\nYou built like a scooter, I'm built like a Hummer\nI was built like a tank; you don't want it, baby, nuh-uh\nStop playing with things that'll get you hurt\nYou a girl, you can't play in the dirt, you got a skirt\nYou don't know a damn thing about putting in the work\nWith your whole effing block something murked like irk\n\n[Hook]",

is harder, the skies is darker\nLook through the eyes of a snake, see inside the monster\nTo rise need divide and conquer\nIf it's all about money I don't respect your power, that's weak\nThey deprive and devour, they cowards if you ask me\nPowers that be mistreat us, mislead us\nThinking eventually we gone bite the hand that feed us\nWe son 'em and try to keep all other from 'em\nNovus ordo seclorum, E pluribus unum\nNew order of the ages, out of many: one\nWhile the rest of us is conned out of pennies: none\nI'm starving, it's problems if we ain't fed quickly\nMy breads use to be the ones taking heads with me\nJealousy, hate, lust and greed is spread quickly\nDon't call me brother if you ain't breaking bread with me\n\n[Hook: Shontelle]\nDon't call me mother\nDon't call me sister\nDon't call me brother\nDon't call me father\n\n[Verse 2: DMX]\nDon't call me brother, we ain't got the same mother\nOr the same father you get down like the other\nDon't speak on wisdom when you know you don't love her\nDon't shake my hand when you wanna see me under\nDon't talk slick behind my back\nDon't walk like this when you act like that\nWhat you trying to bark for when you let you a cat\nCome to your hood like ''brrap, brrap, brrap''\nMess with the kid if you want to\nCause your mans and them to tell you\nIt'll be the last thing that you going through\nYou built like a scooter, I'm built like a Hummer\nI was built like a tank; you don't want it, baby, nuh-uh\nStop playing with things that'll get you hurt\nYou a girl, you can't play in the dirt, you got a skirt\nYou don't know a damn thing about putting in the work\nWith your whole effing block something murked like irk\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "The Saga Begins", "album": "The 18th Letter", "year": "1997-11-04", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYo, the saga begins, my eyes is the photography lens\nProperly pushed pens, to show quality gems\nThe horrors be grim, but yo maybe tomorrow we win\nIf we follow the trends and keep count of the dollars we spend\nI want a mahogany Benz, I want lottery ends\nI want property, friends, plus my hobby is skins\nIf I get sloppy and sin, then my prophecy ends\nBut the God'll begin, watchin my odyssey spin\nIn the place where war be, based on a true story\nTerritory was made for me to pursue glory\nBlast alone masses in zones have to be sewn\nEvery capacity blown, I'm internationally known, yo\nSo all hail the honorable, microphone phenomenal\nPersona is unbombable, trust me son\nI continue like a saga do, bringin you the drama to\nAllow you that the chronicle has just begun\n\n[Hook]\n\"The saga begins\"\n\"The soul controller, Rakim\"\n\"Set it off''\n''Yo, the saga begins\"\n\"Still say a rhyme after the next one\"\n\"The saga begins\"\n\"The soul controller, Rakim\"\n\"Set it off''\n''Yo, the saga begins\"\n''You know that I'm the soloist''\n\n[Verse 2]\nYo, my never-ending epic, got the world spinning hectic\nI quickly spread it, till the whole city's infected\nSuspense that I supply intensify\nThen commence as my daily events go by\nYou get involved in this, paragraphologist\nNarratin novelist, market this, sound marvelous\nI'm the star in this, which means the author's authentic\nMost definite, every episode's a epidemic\nSo when you research, check it, here go the evidence\nThey represent with lyrical negligence for presidents\nMy science existed, without the fiction\nEvery inscription is a special edition\nSo all hail the honorable, microphone phenomenal\nPersona is unbombable, trust me son\nI continue like a saga do, bringing you the drama to\nAllow you that the chronicle has just begun\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nYo, the legacy lives, let em see what the pedigree is\nMega-thesis, blessin these kids with extra features\nThe depth's deep as, the deepest sea is\nTelepathy increases melody gets speakers, telekinesis\nIdeas appear as clear as, pictures in movie theaters\nLyrics you hear it, devestating the way you ear it\nSo stay tuned for sequels, part two's and more\nSo soon you and your peoples can bumrush the store\nThe names have changed the game remain the same\nHow one came to reign on his claim to fame\nNo stoppin this I'm droppin this with hip-hop in this\nAnd when the topic is topicless, then I'm writing the apocalypse\nSo all hail the honorable, microphone phenominal\nPersona is unbombable, trust me son\nI continue like a saga do, bringing you the drama to\nAllow you that the chronicle has just begun\n\n[Hook]", "image":

to show quality gems\nThe horrors be grim, but yo maybe tomorrow we win\nIf we follow the trends and keep count of the dollars we spend\nI want a mahogany Benz, I want lottery ends\nI want property, friends, plus my hobby is skins\nIf I get sloppy and sin, then my prophecy ends\nBut the God'll begin, watchin my odyssey spin\nIn the place where war be, based on a true story\nTerritory was made for me to pursue glory\nBlast alone masses in zones have to be sewn\nEvery capacity blown, I'm internationally known, yo\nSo all hail the honorable, microphone phenomenal\nPersona is unbombable, trust me son\nI continue like a saga do, bringin you the drama to\nAllow you that the chronicle has just begun\n\n[Hook]\n\"The saga begins\"\n\"The soul controller, Rakim\"\n\"Set it off''\n''Yo, the saga begins\"\n\"Still say a rhyme after the next one\"\n\"The saga begins\"\n\"The soul controller, Rakim\"\n\"Set it off''\n''Yo, the saga begins\"\n''You know that I'm the soloist''\n\n[Verse 2]\nYo, my never-ending epic, got the world spinning hectic\nI quickly spread it, till the whole city's infected\nSuspense that I supply intensify\nThen commence as my daily events go by\nYou get involved in this, paragraphologist\nNarratin novelist, market this, sound marvelous\nI'm the star in this, which means the author's authentic\nMost definite, every episode's a epidemic\nSo when you research, check it, here go the evidence\nThey represent with lyrical negligence for presidents\nMy science existed, without the fiction\nEvery inscription is a special edition\nSo all hail the honorable, microphone phenomenal\nPersona is unbombable, trust me son\nI continue like a saga do, bringing you the drama to\nAllow you that the chronicle has just begun\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nYo, the legacy lives, let em see what the pedigree is\nMega-thesis, blessin these kids with extra features\nThe depth's deep as, the deepest sea is\nTelepathy increases melody gets speakers, telekinesis\nIdeas appear as clear as, pictures in movie theaters\nLyrics you hear it, devestating the way you ear it\nSo stay tuned for sequels, part two's and more\nSo soon you and your peoples can bumrush the store\nThe names have changed the game remain the same\nHow one came to reign on his claim to fame\nNo stoppin this I'm droppin this with hip-hop in this\nAnd when the topic is topicless, then I'm writing the apocalypse\nSo all hail the honorable, microphone phenominal\nPersona is unbombable, trust me son\nI continue like a saga do, bringing you the drama to\nAllow you that the chronicle has just begun\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "Flow Forever", "album": "The Master", "year": "1999-11-30", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nHa, what's goin on?

and ballers, new game\nStreet talk straight off the corners, new slang\nI got heat for crowds for those that pursue it\nSpitters, I show you flow till your vocals are through it\nFrom social to

predicates last for pages\nEvery letter fit, trendsetter like fashion statements\nRecruits get a shine and they hope forever\nI wrote some of the illest rhymes ever put together\nSoon as I make 'em rappers take 'em\nAnalyze 'em for days and paraphrase 'em\nI'm back, hip-hoppers'll back my scripts and documents\nRaps hit the block, it's a wrap, it's the apocalypse\nThe hood give my rap flow names\nLike 9/11 and crack cocaine\nI hit the building, it get hotter in 'em\nIt's like birds, most rappers don't know how to flip 'em\nI gotta hip 'em, get hop and show 'em how to spit 'em\nI bust a

it far different\nPart lyricist, part instrument\nStart spittin it the more articulate y'all rhythms get\nTill every syllable you drop it pivotal\nIf it's not original it's not as memorable\nIll

was born in New york City let me hear say \"You know that\"!\nYOU KNOW THAT\n\n[Rakim]\nAiyyo, once upon a rhyme where the scenery sets, you see stress\nStreets a matter of life and death, no regrets\nLife's a test, strife, wit special effects\nNeighbourhood's full of reps, cities are projects\nWhere the young cadets get stripes from the vets\nAnd comrades quest to be the next, to finess\nCollect debts and select bets with death threats\nObject - Chedder, better your total net\nWhere trends are set from ways to express the outfits\nFriends get wet tryin' to make ends connect\nAvenues to check, boulevards to sweat\nThe smell of gunsmoke more common than cigarettes\nWE GOT clicks for wreck\nWE LIKE Pits for pets\nWE GOT Giants and Jets, the Knicks, Yanks and Mets\nWE LIKE much respect and sex extra wet\nAnd High-Tech dialect you ain't catch yet\n\n(The Bronx\nYa out there?\nNo doubt\nBrooklyn\nYa out there)\n\n[Rakim]\nAiyyo, we got blocks and Glocks with\nBig shots with big knots and big props\nYo this is where the bullshit stops\nWhere herbs get got, if you snitch you get shot\nWe get down and leave the town in a state of shock\nWE GOT dangerous hang out spots and slick cops\nPlace called Rikers Island where kids get locked\nA lotta gear to rock with blocks of clothes shops\nStyles are top notch, this is the place to watch\nSo bust the box the radio station is hot\nEase your mind staring at skylines from rooftops\nFlip scripts for chips, and new whips off the lot\nQuick to call a shot, pollitic with thick plots\nAnd the Garden of Eden against the sea that we got\nTo make sure the core of the Big Apple don't rot\nWhere seeings believing we be achieving a lot\nWhere disc jocks created hip hop, check it out!\n\n(Queens - ya out there? no doubt\nManhattan - no doubt\nNew York city, Staten Island\nNew York, New York, Long Island\nNew York - ya out there?)\n\n[Rakim]\nAiyyo, we got five bouroughs of ghettos\nWith many places to meet, you get lost in busy streets\nThe city that never sleeps\nMecca, Pelan, Medina the population increase\nThe desert and the oasis, New York, the far east\nWith Gods and sheiks, pretty Amazons for weeks\nPlayer dons that fleece the family's black sheep\nIcons that teach that we all act unique\nWe got stats to reach so we all have to eat\nA mass of peeps, with they own masterpiece\nThe crafts elite, we be going past the peak\nThe latest technique no other place get as deep\nWho parks release some of the worlds greatest athletes\nDJ's and MC's and graffiti artistes\nWho use walls and subway trains for marquees\nWe go back to b-boys, breakdancing, breakbeats\nAnd it'll never cease and on that note, we say peace", "image":

know that\"!\nYOU KNOW THAT\n\n[Rakim]\nAiyyo, once upon a rhyme where the scenery sets, you see stress\nStreets a matter of life and death, no regrets\nLife's a test, strife, wit special effects\nNeighbourhood's full of reps, cities are projects\nWhere the young cadets get stripes from the vets\nAnd comrades quest to be the next, to finess\nCollect debts and select bets with death threats\nObject - Chedder, better your total net\nWhere trends are set from ways to express the outfits\nFriends get wet tryin' to make ends connect\nAvenues to check, boulevards to sweat\nThe smell of gunsmoke more common than cigarettes\nWE GOT clicks for wreck\nWE LIKE Pits for pets\nWE GOT Giants and Jets, the Knicks, Yanks and Mets\nWE LIKE much respect and sex extra wet\nAnd High-Tech dialect you ain't catch yet\n\n(The Bronx\nYa out there?\nNo doubt\nBrooklyn\nYa out there)\n\n[Rakim]\nAiyyo, we got blocks and Glocks with\nBig shots with big knots and big props\nYo this is where the bullshit stops\nWhere herbs get got, if you snitch you get shot\nWe get down and leave the town in a state of shock\nWE GOT dangerous hang out spots and slick cops\nPlace called Rikers Island where kids get locked\nA lotta gear to rock with blocks of clothes shops\nStyles are top notch, this is the place to watch\nSo bust the box the radio station is hot\nEase your mind staring at skylines from rooftops\nFlip scripts for chips, and new whips off the lot\nQuick to call a shot, pollitic with thick plots\nAnd the Garden of Eden against the sea that we got\nTo make sure the core of the Big Apple don't rot\nWhere seeings believing we be achieving a lot\nWhere disc jocks created hip hop, check it out!\n\n(Queens - ya out there? no doubt\nManhattan - no doubt\nNew York city, Staten Island\nNew York, New York, Long Island\nNew York - ya out there?)\n\n[Rakim]\nAiyyo, we got five bouroughs of ghettos\nWith many places to meet, you get lost in busy streets\nThe city that never sleeps\nMecca, Pelan, Medina the population increase\nThe desert and the oasis, New York, the far east\nWith Gods and sheiks, pretty Amazons for weeks\nPlayer dons that fleece the family's black sheep\nIcons that teach that we all act unique\nWe got stats to reach so we all have to eat\nA mass of peeps, with they own masterpiece\nThe crafts elite, we be going past the peak\nThe latest technique no other place get as deep\nWho parks release some of the worlds greatest athletes\nDJ's and MC's and graffiti artistes\nWho use walls and subway trains for marquees\nWe go back to b-boys, breakdancing, breakbeats\nAnd it'll never cease and on that note, we say peace"}}, {"title": "When I'm Flowin", "album": "The 18th Letter", "year": "1997-11-04", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nYes, yes y'all, check it out y'all\nYes, yes y'all, check it out y'all\n\n[Hook]\nYo,I find a show, rhyme til it's time to go\nI'm designed to blow, my mind's inclined to flow\nYo, my M.O., makin all kind of dough\nFrom the info that Rakim show, y'know?\n\n[Verse 1]\nYes yes y'all, I still fiend by any means\nTo flow, and I go through extremes don't intervene\nMy adventures show like a three dimensional screen\nCause I mention many things and I'm presentin many scenes\nGuess I'm telegraphic, motions energentic\nBetter tell em forget it, cause I'm telekinetic\nCrowds is screamin, I choke the mic and keep squeezin\nStyles seemin like I used a thousand words without breathin\nBustin techs like Russian Roulette I doubt you win\nFreestyles like hand grenades without the pin\nComposin, then leave the mic full of corrosion\nDon\u2019t test this, or catch the asbestos exposure\nAt shows I spit flows with seven deadly venoms\nKillin syllables with poisonous synonyms in em\nIdeas is blowin, mics is blowin\nFrom what I'm showin, see it, I keep it goin when I'm flowin\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen I'm flowin, theoretically speakin like a drummer\nI take you through the streets to the parks in the summer\nOr illustrate, a time and place you never been in\nAnd make you focus on the future after seein the beginning\nAnd my style wilds, like Miles on the trumpet\nVolume dial was kind of low, need to pump it\nUp another notch turn the dial til it stops\nMore watts you got, more things to watch\nThird eye's wide open, you're focused on the theory\nKeep scopin til you hear me, words is spoken clearly\nIt's no smokescreens on the scenes that I'm showin\nMan I keep it goin, damn I keep it flowin\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nTwo pages cause panic, freestyles is frantic\nThoughts is organic, flow is aerodynamic\nMic is volcanic, rhymes spread across the planet\nI send out the scribe now the vibes gigantic\nNow, I'm internationally known, mental capacities blown\nI hope your microphone's accident prone\nRaw footage is shown, but only showin scenes of my own\nLeavin your periphereal vision in a zone\nBut not the twilight, from the insight that I write\nAnd recite, in my mic'll be bright, cause I like\nThe night glowin, it's out of sight when I'm showin\nMan I keep it goin, damn I keep it flowin\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 4]\nYo, accurate tactics make 'em clap to this\nWhen I move the crowd, my rhythm still don't miss\nBreeze through melodies cause it's been a long time\nMy lyrics is fury and rappers hate to hear me rhyme\nEvery antidote that I quote, is no joke\nNobody's smilin in the ghetto from the notes I wrote\nMy high techniques wreck and disrespect beats\nHave you follow-in the leader up and down the streets\nSo kick along as I rip a song with pull\nAs the rhyme goes on I get paid in full\nIt's Rakim, I'm indicating rhymes for the showing\nCheck it out y'all, I keep it goin when I'm flowing\n\n[Hook]", "image":

my M.O., makin all kind of dough\nFrom the info that Rakim show, y'know?\n\n[Verse 1]\nYes yes y'all, I still fiend by any means\nTo flow, and I go through extremes don't intervene\nMy adventures show like a three dimensional screen\nCause I mention many things and I'm presentin many scenes\nGuess I'm telegraphic, motions energentic\nBetter tell em forget it, cause I'm telekinetic\nCrowds is screamin, I choke the mic and keep squeezin\nStyles seemin like I used a thousand words without breathin\nBustin techs like Russian Roulette I doubt you win\nFreestyles like hand grenades without the pin\nComposin, then leave the mic full of corrosion\nDon\u2019t test this, or catch the asbestos exposure\nAt shows I spit flows with seven deadly venoms\nKillin syllables with poisonous synonyms in em\nIdeas is blowin, mics is blowin\nFrom what I'm showin, see it, I keep it goin when I'm flowin\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen I'm flowin, theoretically speakin like a drummer\nI take you through the streets to the parks in the summer\nOr illustrate, a time and place you never been in\nAnd make you focus on the future after seein the beginning\nAnd my style wilds, like Miles on the trumpet\nVolume dial was kind of low, need to pump it\nUp another notch turn the dial til it stops\nMore watts you got, more things to watch\nThird eye's wide open, you're focused on the theory\nKeep scopin til you hear me, words is spoken clearly\nIt's no smokescreens on the scenes that I'm showin\nMan I keep it goin, damn I keep it flowin\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nTwo pages cause panic, freestyles is frantic\nThoughts is organic, flow is aerodynamic\nMic is volcanic, rhymes spread across the planet\nI send out the scribe now the vibes gigantic\nNow, I'm internationally known, mental capacities blown\nI hope your microphone's accident prone\nRaw footage is shown, but only showin scenes of my own\nLeavin your periphereal vision in a zone\nBut not the twilight, from the insight that I write\nAnd recite, in my mic'll be bright, cause I like\nThe night glowin, it's out of sight when I'm showin\nMan I keep it goin, damn I keep it flowin\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 4]\nYo, accurate tactics make 'em clap to this\nWhen I move the crowd, my rhythm still don't miss\nBreeze through melodies cause it's been a long time\nMy lyrics is fury and rappers hate to hear me rhyme\nEvery antidote that I quote, is no joke\nNobody's smilin in the ghetto from the notes I wrote\nMy high techniques wreck and disrespect beats\nHave you follow-in the leader up and down the streets\nSo kick along as I rip a song with pull\nAs the rhyme goes on I get paid in full\nIt's Rakim, I'm indicating rhymes for the showing\nCheck it out y'all, I keep it goin when I'm flowing\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "After You Die", "album": "Dretox", "year": null, "lyrics": "[Hook: Truth Hurts]\nDo you ever think\nWhat life would be\nWhere you will go\nAfter you die?\n\n[Verse 1: Rakim]\nDo you ever sit back and get a little too high\nStart thinking what happens to you when you die?\nDoes your soul rest where your coffin is\nOr is death just a metamorphosis?\nDoes life go on in the mental form\nIf we live a good life will we get reborn?\nIs it a heaven or we trapped in hell?\nWhere do we go from here, nobody came back to tell\nIf we reincarnated or perish in time\nCould you shine when darkness inherits your mind?\nAnd your eyes closed for good, you out the galaxy now\nIs this subconscious dream my reality now?\nListen to brain, with no physical frame\nCould we return to the hood on a spiritual plane?\nAsk yourself, If I pass tonight\nAm I prepared for what's after life? (After you die)\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Rakim]\nCould we come back, do we get left in the past?\nFuck that, I'mma kick death in the ass\nTo come walk with the creator, 'til my mind is greater\nGet insight so I could design and find data\n'Til my third eye gives me a bird's eye view\nFocus 'til my ghost is on a curb by you\nWatchin you mourn my death, like im lost in time\nBut im with you even if I don't cross your mind\nWhen you pour out liquor, im catchin the Cognac\nWhen you pull out a spliff im catchin the contact\nTry to look after my people, that's trapped in evil\nPlayin craps and c-low, to get gats and kilos\nAnd still do some of the things that I love to do\nHang on the streets, throw it up in a club or two\nSee women and catch'em in their wildest dreams\nPossess 'em, make'em do the wildest things\nAnd my peeps, what I'mma do, is pray that you blessed\nAnd my kids, keep'em away from the angel of death\nSo just in case if I pass tonight\nYo, im prepared for what's after life.

die?\n\n[Verse 1: Rakim]\nDo you ever sit back and get a little too high\nStart thinking what happens to you when you die?\nDoes your soul rest where your coffin is\nOr is death just a metamorphosis?\nDoes life go on in the mental form\nIf we live a good life will we get reborn?\nIs it a heaven or we trapped in hell?\nWhere do we go from here, nobody came back to tell\nIf we reincarnated or perish in time\nCould you shine when darkness inherits your mind?\nAnd your eyes closed for good, you out the galaxy now\nIs this subconscious dream my reality now?\nListen to brain, with no physical frame\nCould we return to the hood on a spiritual plane?\nAsk yourself, If I pass tonight\nAm I prepared for what's after life? (After you die)\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Rakim]\nCould we come back, do we get left in the past?\nFuck that, I'mma kick death in the ass\nTo come walk with the creator, 'til my mind is greater\nGet insight so I could design and find data\n'Til my third eye gives me a bird's eye view\nFocus 'til my ghost is on a curb by you\nWatchin you mourn my death, like im lost in time\nBut im with you even if I don't cross your mind\nWhen you pour out liquor, im catchin the Cognac\nWhen you pull out a spliff im catchin the contact\nTry to look after my people, that's trapped in evil\nPlayin craps and c-low, to get gats and kilos\nAnd still do some of the things that I love to do\nHang on the streets, throw it up in a club or two\nSee women and catch'em in their wildest dreams\nPossess 'em, make'em do the wildest things\nAnd my peeps, what I'mma do, is pray that you blessed\nAnd my kids, keep'em away from the angel of death\nSo just in case if I pass tonight\nYo, im prepared for what's after life.

fresh out the crib sauteein\nAround the way-in, swerve on surveyin\nThat's when I saw her, the kind you wanna see more of\nThe sexy aura, it made it hard to ignore her\nExpression her posession of property skyrocket\nI'm investin in her presence and in time the profits\nI take a acre for you, fertilize the soil\nAnd make it boil, til it produce black oil\nThe Shorty sweet as, the flavor of forty divas\nPhotos and features, worth more than Mona Lisa's\nIt's lady luscious, tender touches my blood rushes\nSmiles and blushes, on billboards and buses\nAnd me, I'm just a bronze skinned calm gentleman\nSlim fit and open arms mellow wit a Don's grin\nGhetto disciplined, could be your confidant beyond friend\nIt's one of Allah's men, Rakim, show me love\n\n[Hook]\nPromise you won't do me wrong (uh)\nIf I turn you on (go ahead, uh)\nPromise you'll stay all night long (uh, yeah)\nMakin love til dawn (turn me on love)\nPromise you won't do me wrong (mmm)\nIf I turn you on (mmm, mmm, yeah)\nPromise you'll stay all night long\nSo we can get it on (check it out)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm in effect mode, I keep the ep sewed\nWhen you express your finesse to your dress code\nEvery step's a pose, you've been blessed and it shows\nMy interest grows, the effervesce explodes\nBecause this chick's, characteristics, mystic\nHips are thick, just a little bit of lipstick\nCan't resist it, description Egyptian smile\nQueen of the Nile, that means she dipped in style\nShe re-mind of Nefretiti, yes indeed-y\nBut it's hard to get it like hieroglyphic graffiti\nStudied her exhibits and checked her colorful curves\nIntellect with swerves I coulda wrecked my nerves\nThat's my word, diggin her enigma that exist\nIn a sister, carefully wrapped in her figure\nWe connect like a collision and hug, just to knowledge\nHer wisdom, speed up my metabolism, show me love\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nYour M.O. is hard not to notice, so my motives\nIs to stay focused, body moves like aerobics\nAttractions, vibes I caught came from your ways\nAnd actions but mindframe hard to explain\nNo actin or mindgames, but thinkin of what can happen\nIs migraines, the x-rated though remains\nWe relaxin, and you naggin me for the agony\nTo your anatomy, by the fractions\nYour measurements, the pleasure's in every inch of your temple\nI travel twenty-three million miles of your mental\nChemistry, between you and me, in harmony\nCausin angles to meet, like trigonometry\nOr pyramids, that's where your deepest, treasures are hid\nThen it gets, odiferous, cause I know where it is\nI mastered that, cause it's easy when you react\nThe all-natural aphrodisiac, show me love\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "Remember That", "album": "The 18th Letter", "year": "1997-11-04", "lyrics": "[Intro]\n(Rakim remembers)\nRemember that?\n\n[Verse 1]\nTurn the beat up, I get lost in the mind come across\nThe rhyme kick my feet up, then I find myself in time\nI was on a train, destination Marley Marl's domain\nI entertained things'll never be the same\nDJ's are conveyed if the label OK it\nTeddy Ted and Special K was the first ones to play it\nOn the radio, with the crazy flow\nI pay dues until it pays me dough to do a show\nWhen I'm at the helm I cover the whole realm\nIn control and leave your soul overwhelmed\nUnder the influence of beats and instruments\nLyrics make it intricate and elements are tense\nWhen you was playin Pac Man it was the jams I packed\nPeeps would swarm when I was performing black, I'm all that\nBack before they turned hip-hop to rap\nIt always a place to party at, remember that?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI remember the spots that used to be hot\nJust like the roof top, a place that only few can rock\nOn a wild ass block, yeah you find me there a lot\nUntil you hear gunshots, that's when the fun stops\nHere come the cops, time to go home, get in order\nCause I'll be back in Manhattan if somethings happenin at the Latin Quarter\nHouse of Havoc when it came to fourteen carat\nAnd if you had it, yeah, kids'd try to grab it\nIt's cool at the Red Parrot, we was doin' it there\nI was the first one to rip it at the Union Square\nMe and DJ Red Alert did work\nA crazy concert, a lot of kids got hurt\nI did encores at the Encore, they wanted more\nI kicked a freestyle til I heard the crowd roar\nLike the Funhouse, Bronx Center never endin black\nPlace to be was the Brooklyn Armory, remember that?\n\n[Verse 3]\nOpen the door, let the crowds in, over twenty thousand\nWildin' music's loud and microphone's growlin'\nTickets are sold out, parties is packed and on tour\nRippin' basketball arenas back then\nEven after-parties, posses of players and hotties\nEverybody was Gotti, spreadin' bucks like shotties\nSpendin' cash, to make a good time last\nThoughts that I had give me a blast of the past\nMemories of unforgettable times on my mind\nDollar signs and melodies and incredible rhymes\nThe people I met, and the sets that got wrecked\nAll the mics I checked, most of all life's effects\nAnd peace to all the people I grew up around\nIn the streets back when beats had a rougher sound\nI used to be wild me and my crew sit back and we smile\nKeep piles of pictures filed in case I go senile\nCause some things are just too good to be forgot\nLike your neighborhood block or your favorite spot\nCertain records always seem to make me reminisce\nAnd when it hits, and then it clicks, remember this\nMy life flashed before me I'm there from the sounds\nI hear pinpoint the year, it's perfectly clear\nI like the way it went down and alla that, in fact\nIt mean a lot, cause you can't bring it back, remember that", "image": "https://images.genius.com/623e8b053d42f096f389fcd0d63e9f2c.950x950x1.jpg", "artist": "Rakim", "raw":

a train, destination Marley Marl's domain\nI entertained things'll never be the same\nDJ's are conveyed if the label OK it\nTeddy Ted and Special K was the first ones to play it\nOn the radio, with the crazy flow\nI pay dues until it pays me dough to do a show\nWhen I'm at the helm I cover the whole realm\nIn control and leave your soul overwhelmed\nUnder the influence of beats and instruments\nLyrics make it intricate and elements are tense\nWhen you was playin Pac Man it was the jams I packed\nPeeps would swarm when I was performing black, I'm all that\nBack before they turned hip-hop to rap\nIt always a place to party at, remember that?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI remember the spots that used to be hot\nJust like the roof top, a place that only few can rock\nOn a wild ass block, yeah you find me there a lot\nUntil you hear gunshots, that's when the fun stops\nHere come the cops, time to go home, get in order\nCause I'll be back in Manhattan if somethings happenin at the Latin Quarter\nHouse of Havoc when it came to fourteen carat\nAnd if you had it, yeah, kids'd try to grab it\nIt's cool at the Red Parrot, we was doin' it there\nI was the first one to rip it at the Union Square\nMe and DJ Red Alert did work\nA crazy concert, a lot of kids got hurt\nI did encores at the Encore, they wanted more\nI kicked a freestyle til I heard the crowd roar\nLike the Funhouse, Bronx Center never endin black\nPlace to be was the Brooklyn Armory, remember that?\n\n[Verse 3]\nOpen the door, let the crowds in, over twenty thousand\nWildin' music's loud and microphone's growlin'\nTickets are sold out, parties is packed and on tour\nRippin' basketball arenas back then\nEven after-parties, posses of players and hotties\nEverybody was Gotti, spreadin' bucks like shotties\nSpendin' cash, to make a good time last\nThoughts that I had give me a blast of the past\nMemories of unforgettable times on my mind\nDollar signs and melodies and incredible rhymes\nThe people I met, and the sets that got wrecked\nAll the mics I checked, most of all life's effects\nAnd peace to all the people I grew up around\nIn the streets back when beats had a rougher sound\nI used to be wild me and my crew sit back and we smile\nKeep piles of pictures filed in case I go senile\nCause some things are just too good to be forgot\nLike your neighborhood block or your favorite spot\nCertain records always seem to make me reminisce\nAnd when it hits, and then it clicks, remember this\nMy life flashed before me I'm there from the sounds\nI hear pinpoint the year, it's perfectly clear\nI like the way it went down and alla that, in fact\nIt mean a lot, cause you can't bring it back, remember that"}}, {"title": "King's Paradise", "album": " Luke Cage: Season 2

for the cause, all the way to the top Rivalry wars, life can be lost\nNo time for remorse\nForward, always for Pop, until the crown is rightfully yours\nBut success brings sacrifice\nAnd knowing what's at stake\nThe pressure could crack a pipe\nBut everything has a price\nBut you pay with your life in the King's Paradise\n\n[Chrous]\nThe king (king)\nThe king (king)\nThe king (king)\nThe

incarcerated\nLocked up, his alter ego builds\nExperimented on, left him with superhero skills\nNow everyday he gets twice as strong\nBulletproof skin, but his life is torn\nThe only lady he ever loved in his life is gone\nEscaped prison, got to fight to right his wrong\nNo question\nHe gon' take on the whole hood in a hoodie\nNo weapons and no cape on\nOne by one and knock 'em out\nUntil Cottonmouth is forgot about\nBut success brings sacrifice\nAnd if you thinking it's a piece of cake, you can have a slice\nIt's like gambling with a pair of dice\nBut you pay with your life in the

Philip Payton\nThe renaissance in the making\nEllington, Garvey, Joe Louis, Lena Horne\nMalcolm, Maya, Louis Armstrong\nBut now crime is the new crave, so it's a new crusade\nSo salute to Luke Cage\nFight for the cause, all the way to the top Rivalry wars, life can be lost\nNo time for remorse\nForward, always for Pop, until the crown is rightfully yours\nBut success brings sacrifice\nAnd knowing what's at stake\nThe pressure could crack a pipe\nBut everything has a price\nBut you pay with your life in the King's Paradise\n\n[Chrous]\nThe king (king)\nThe king (king)\nThe king (king)\nThe king's Luke Cage (king)\nParadise\nThe king (king)\nThe king (king)\nThe king (king)\nThe king (king)\nThe king\n\n[Verse 2]\nThis story gets complicated\nHe got framed for a crime and incarcerated\nLocked up, his alter ego builds\nExperimented on, left him with superhero skills\nNow everyday he gets twice as strong\nBulletproof skin, but his life is torn\nThe only lady he ever loved in his life is gone\nEscaped prison, got to fight to right his wrong\nNo question\nHe gon' take on the whole hood in a hoodie\nNo weapons and no cape on\nOne by one and knock 'em out\nUntil Cottonmouth is forgot about\nBut success brings sacrifice\nAnd if you thinking it's a piece of cake, you can have a slice\nIt's like gambling with a pair of dice\nBut you pay with your life in the King's Paradise\n\n[Chorus]\nThe king (king)\nThe king (king)\nThe king (king)\nThe king's Luke Cage (king)\nSuperhero skills\nThe king"}}, {"title": "Dedicated", "album": "The Seventh Seal", "year":

go train, they so lame, playin with no game\nPut em on the low flame til they can't claim no fame\nI got, the range, better, stay in the slow lane\nI make the flow change from hurricanes to a slow rain\nYour thoughts are so plane, I rearrange your whole frame\nUntil my whole name grow out your brain like Rogaine\nLetter by letter, I put words together\nOnce merged, apart never, they be heard forever\nAnd then I grab a pen and stab him in his abdomen\nAnd smash him in, throw his mic like a javelin\nThen I explain verses, that remain on the surface\nAt times it get deep, but I never defeat the purpose\nNever go out, to go the dough route, forever hold out\nI never sold out, for any amount, no doubt\n\n[Hook]\nThat's how I get down, so tell me how you like that\nI hit the town, hold it down on a tight track\nI start a party now - everybody like rap\nHaters are mad cause they gave the R the mic back\n\n[Verse 2]\nI like to hang where e'rythang seem to happen at (y'know?)\nIt's Ra's habitat, I'm like Yasser Arafat\nAnd yes I have a gat, snap like a Israeli\nA terrorist I never miss blowin up kids daily\nI step to writers, and let my virus hurt the closest\nI'm sick as hepatitis and worse than tuberculosis\nPull out a pen, like a grenade, and drop it quick\nI strike again and I'mma get paid, exotic shit\nYou know the God ra be, hot as the Mojave\nSwing like King Usabi, my posse be kamikaze\nOn the corners like I'm homeless and I, don't know where home is\nThe bonus, is where the next open microphone is\nMe and my team, vision like a radar screen\nIntervene and yo, cut the mic off, cause Ra fiend\nTo show the whole world some of the things I seen\nThen blow it up, like Idi Amin, yaknahmean?\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI do a thang thang, I write the songs they sing\nMake sure that they swing, from New York to Beijing\nPut your thoughts in the sling and your brain is gangrene\nPull in the ring, repeatin and sayin the same thing\nXerox, zero, no match, you ditto\nCopy machine, couldn't reprint my litto\nMy new style, that I produce now's beyond two-thou'\nI knew how, since a juvenile, to make a ka-pow\nWhen the night's fallin, I can hear the mic callin\nI like ballin, I cut back like Mike Jordan\nThis is for y'all while I'm spittin literatures\nLyrics'll ball like Allen Iverson dribble the ball\nThey hopeless - whoever approaches my high explosives\nMy vision sadicious, and freestyle's ferocious\nI wrote this, words flew over my head like a locust\nI turned the beat up, sat back, and stayed focused\n\n[Hook]", "image":

blows us away\nWe stand talk while they fall together\nNone left, I formation like the letter\nModel and the shelter it's built for whatever\nTil the wind blows us away\n\nFrom the beginning it felt like we been in love\nWe took a chance knowing how slim it was\nThe world is ours now let's split it up\nAnd you know how short life is let's big it up\nLet's get fitted up, get it in and live it up\nDinner plus the cinema then lets hit the club\nPosting up like both of us is spending ones\nCause we ain't get it if it didn't come in him and hers\nChemistry together just like a recipe\nOr destiny we was meant to be together\nDon't worry about me going left or doing you wrong\nWe right for each other it's a beautiful bond\nWe hug and touch, we love and lust\nWe last through the bashes, we cuss and fuss\nUntil we trust the love it's just for us\nUntil its ashes to ashes and dust to dust\n\nChorus\n\nIn each others arms it's like heroin love\nThat dope fiend forever in love\nBut it's better than drugs\nIt's heavy on the heart it's still a risk\nBut we never fall apart we was built for this\nNothing that we can't sort out, it's brought up\nAnd thought out, erase all doubt go hard and all out\nYou and my fam fall out most of your family can't stand me\nWe can't let that cross out our family plans, can we?\nWe won't get no love from it\nLet's just keep it one hunnid 'til we one hunnid\nStack grands 'til we grand-parents\nWhatever work but let's hope for the best and expect the worst\nCause we'll have good and bad times together\nBut the bad will make the good times that much better\nSo let's absolve it 'til we sprawled out in coffins\nAnd 2012 if the world fall out the orbit\n\nChorus\n\nWe go together like criminals and crime\nInstrumentals and rhymes\nClothes and trends, like real G's and dimes\nStone gems and shine, real cream and pies\nChrome rims and rides, like ill teams and grinds\nLike identical designs the pinnacle to rise\nLike flows and ants, like skill dreams and drive\nHome in France like a little trees and vibes\nClose as kin or like heels, jeans and thighs\nSince I was rocking Giseles you was hotter than hell\nNow it's me and you like Barack and Michelle\nDenzel and Pauletta prevail when all weather\nStand tall while they fail and fall together\nThe pleasure and the pain, the pressure and the hate\nThrough whatever we together like forever and a day\nChecks and dollar signs the love for paper\nBetter yet like father time and mother nature\n\nChorus\n\nI told you from the rip\nWe gone do what we do, you know what I mean?\nIt's me

"lyrics": "Chorus (Samuel Christian):\n\nYou and I will always be together\nPeace or war, no matter the weather\nMe and you like birds of a feather\nTil the wind blows us away\nWe stand talk while they fall together\nNone left, I formation like the letter\nModel and the shelter it's built for whatever\nTil the wind blows us away\n\nFrom the beginning it felt like we been in love\nWe took a chance knowing how slim it was\nThe world is ours now let's split it up\nAnd you know how short life is let's big it up\nLet's get fitted up, get it in and live it up\nDinner plus the cinema then lets hit the club\nPosting up like both of us is spending ones\nCause we ain't get it if it didn't come in him and hers\nChemistry together just like a recipe\nOr destiny we was meant to be together\nDon't worry about me going left or doing you wrong\nWe right for each other it's a beautiful bond\nWe hug and touch, we love and lust\nWe last through the bashes, we cuss and fuss\nUntil we trust the love it's just for us\nUntil its ashes to ashes and dust to dust\n\nChorus\n\nIn each others arms it's like heroin love\nThat dope fiend forever in love\nBut it's better than drugs\nIt's heavy on the heart it's still a risk\nBut we never fall apart we was built for this\nNothing that we can't sort out, it's brought up\nAnd thought out, erase all doubt go hard and all out\nYou and my fam fall out most of your family can't stand me\nWe can't let that cross out our family plans, can we?\nWe won't get no love from it\nLet's just keep it one hunnid 'til we one hunnid\nStack grands 'til we grand-parents\nWhatever work but let's hope for the best and expect the worst\nCause we'll have good and bad times together\nBut the bad will make the good times that much better\nSo let's absolve it 'til we sprawled out in coffins\nAnd 2012 if the world fall out the orbit\n\nChorus\n\nWe go together like criminals and crime\nInstrumentals and rhymes\nClothes and trends, like real G's and dimes\nStone gems and shine, real cream and pies\nChrome rims and rides, like ill teams and grinds\nLike identical designs the pinnacle to rise\nLike flows and ants, like skill dreams and drive\nHome in France like a little trees and vibes\nClose as kin or like heels, jeans and thighs\nSince I was rocking Giseles you was hotter than hell\nNow it's me and you like Barack and Michelle\nDenzel and Pauletta prevail when all weather\nStand tall while they fail and fall together\nThe pleasure and the pain, the pressure and the hate\nThrough whatever we together like forever and a day\nChecks and dollar signs the love for paper\nBetter yet like father time and mother nature\n\nChorus\n\nI told you from the rip\nWe gone do what we do, you know what I mean?\nIt's me and you, you and I\nIt's the G-O-D"}}, {"title": "Stay Awhile", "album": "The 18th Letter", "year": "1997-11-04", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nWhat you wanna say to make me stay awhile\nWhat you wanna say to make me wanna stay\n\n[Verse 1]\nJust me and my peeps we gettin buzzed, lookin for clubs\nMisses with kisses and hugs, lookin for love\nShe gotta be nice with hers, even with cookin some grub\nOnce I'm in I meet her friends, then I'm hookin my thugs\nWe'll be blowin hundreds, always knowin where the fun is\nRoadrunners findin more spots than Columbus\nPocket full of phone numbers from some of the world wonders\nI take my time, and find where the right one is\nSmooth as jazz but more than a half, ready for math\nAnd on a steady path, like Betty Shabazz\nAnd when I see the wiz I'mma step to my biz\nAnd there she is, let's see if she pass the quiz\nIt's appropriate we go get soakin wet\nToast, we met, become close associates\nThe place is ours by now I can embrace your style\nSo much flavor I can taste your smile, stay awhile\n\n[Hook]\nWhy don't you, stay a little while\nStay, stay a little while, child\nBaby, why don't you, stay a little while\nStay, ayyyayyy, stay a little while, child\nBaby, why don't you\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe on the low mating, infiltrating, negotiating\nWe both be makin moves and dough, M.O.'s relating\nShe ain't takin I want it but yo I know she waiting\nI throw the bait in, and before you know we dating\nI want the format, to the doormat\nContacts, fast callbacks and all that\nYour deepest ecstasy see your accessories\nYour secret recipes to your bear necessities\nShe real exotic body feel like Lucile Roberts\nName brand closets, culturized products\nClaws like a scorpion caught me in deeper\nBut juice sweeter, enough to buy a two seater\nEvery mile I plan to have your mind beguiled\nTil it informs me more than you would normally allow\nRaised more than an eyebrow with a flagrant style\nBy now I can taste your smile, stay awhile\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nSometimes it's hard to fight it and not let her see me get excited\nBut she know I like it, she know the deal like a psychic\nMind is haunted, because I always find her on it\nShe know what I want, where I want, when I want it\nBlowin up my Motorola, daddy you comin over?\nShe on the sofa, holdin a remote controller\nCandles burnin lower, favorite dish gettin colder\nShe hot as solar, cause I told her I wanna hold her\nBut her mission she sittin in one position like Yoga\nA TV show is on to top it off she dead sober\nThen I open the door up, and kiss her on the shoulder\nShe say I'm rollin, like Mr. Lover Lover\nWe had a hard day, ready to parlay\nMy thirsts they obey everything that God say\nOkay let's play awhile and I'll embrace your style\nSo much flavor I can taste your smile, stay awhile\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/623e8b053d42f096f389fcd0d63e9f2c.950x950x1.jpg", "artist": "Rakim", "raw": {"annotation_count": 15, "api_path": "/songs/38573", "apple_music_id":

stay\n\n[Verse 1]\nJust me and my peeps we gettin buzzed, lookin for clubs\nMisses with kisses and hugs, lookin for love\nShe gotta be nice with hers, even with cookin some grub\nOnce I'm in I meet her friends, then I'm hookin my thugs\nWe'll be blowin hundreds, always knowin where the fun is\nRoadrunners findin more spots than Columbus\nPocket full of phone numbers from some of the world wonders\nI take my time, and find where the right one is\nSmooth as jazz but more than a half, ready for math\nAnd on a steady path, like Betty Shabazz\nAnd when I see the wiz I'mma step to my biz\nAnd there she is, let's see if she pass the quiz\nIt's appropriate we go get soakin wet\nToast, we met, become close associates\nThe place is ours by now I can embrace your style\nSo much flavor I can taste your smile, stay awhile\n\n[Hook]\nWhy don't you, stay a little while\nStay, stay a little while, child\nBaby, why don't you, stay a little while\nStay, ayyyayyy, stay a little while, child\nBaby, why don't you\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe on the low mating, infiltrating, negotiating\nWe both be makin moves and dough, M.O.'s relating\nShe ain't takin I want it but yo I know she waiting\nI throw the bait in, and before you know we dating\nI want the format, to the doormat\nContacts, fast callbacks and all that\nYour deepest ecstasy see your accessories\nYour secret recipes to your bear necessities\nShe real exotic body feel like Lucile Roberts\nName brand closets, culturized products\nClaws like a scorpion caught me in deeper\nBut juice sweeter, enough to buy a two seater\nEvery mile I plan to have your mind beguiled\nTil it informs me more than you would normally allow\nRaised more than an eyebrow with a flagrant style\nBy now I can taste your smile, stay awhile\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nSometimes it's hard to fight it and not let her see me get excited\nBut she know I like it, she know the deal like a psychic\nMind is haunted, because I always find her on it\nShe know what I want, where I want, when I want it\nBlowin up my Motorola, daddy you comin over?\nShe on the sofa, holdin a remote controller\nCandles burnin lower, favorite dish gettin colder\nShe hot as solar, cause I told her I wanna hold her\nBut her mission she sittin in one position like Yoga\nA TV show is on to top it off she dead sober\nThen I open the door up, and kiss her on the shoulder\nShe say I'm rollin, like Mr. Lover Lover\nWe had a hard day, ready to parlay\nMy thirsts they obey everything that God say\nOkay let's play awhile and I'll embrace your style\nSo much flavor I can taste your smile, stay awhile\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "Documentary of a Gangsta", "album": "The Seventh Seal", "year": "2009-11-17", "lyrics": "Hey yo, this right here man\nIs like a

her up\nIf I must explain with words, I smooth as a fuck!\nThe world's most greatest hip-hop's elite\nYou obsolete, you cannot compete, drop the beat\nKeep ya ear to the ground when I rock the street\nCock the heat, we deep papi got to eat\nSo cut on the mic and spit, I much rougher\nPlenty of ice and a whip, plus a crusher\nBecause I don't like to stick, or bust a brother\nLong as they never forget I'm a ill muther fucker\n\n[Hook]\nSo if you love to get your party on\nAnd you feel that your game is strong\nAnd you get mad when the broads is gone\nYou like it all-night-long\nAnd

player, so why hate it\nMy rhyme through out of control, when I say it\nSpit back with a rap or a gat, can I spray it\nHow can I say it? I leave it de-hydrated\nI take aim, and he keep the place flamin'\nTill the place cave in, aye yo this ain't a safe haven\nSave the playin, stay blazin with bass bangin\nThe best is yet to come, so they stay in\nThey keep the music loud, the lights is low\nThe kid with a different style, I like to flow\nIt's time to move the crowd, tonight's the show\nSee what it's all about, they like to go\nGet henny and mo and cris\nThe clothes, the platinum, gold, the wrist\nPlenty of doe, and chicks who pose for flicks\nWomen who love roll their hips, when I'm holding this\n\n[Verse 3]\nMy mic's a equipped with a microchip, with a million Megs\nBite this I might flip, spread a billion plagues\nPut medicine in it before I kill ya dead\nYou can get away, if you can feel your legs\nCould you walk? No, at least you fought though\nAuto fours blow a hole in your torso\nDamage his brain with more flow until he talk slow\nTry to say something now? I thought so!\nI leave emcee's bleeding, while I'm fleeing across sea-in\nStart breeding, double my Swiss cheese in Sweden\nFree on the weekend, come back see if he breathing\nThey breathing, somebody left his brains beat in\nA deadly attack is rare, style will be raw\nBe ready to rap you'll hear, as wild as before\nIf I bust a gat in the air, watch the galaxy fall\nAnd the world will be splat on

again\nIn a club or the streets I swerve, cool in the cut\nLooking to see what occurs, crusin' the truck\nShorty got deadly curves, soothin' her up\nIf I must explain with words, I smooth as a fuck!\nThe world's most greatest hip-hop's elite\nYou obsolete, you cannot compete, drop the beat\nKeep ya ear to the ground when I rock the street\nCock the heat, we deep papi got to eat\nSo cut on the mic and spit, I much rougher\nPlenty of ice and a whip, plus a crusher\nBecause I don't like to stick, or bust a brother\nLong as they never forget I'm a ill muther fucker\n\n[Hook]\nSo if you love to get your party on\nAnd you feel that your game is strong\nAnd you get mad when the broads is gone\nYou like it all-night-long\nAnd when they love it when the place is warm\nAnd they go out for their favorite song\nThey hate when the player game is wrong\nThey like it all-night-long\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy caliber's high rated\nYeah player, so why hate it\nMy rhyme through out of control, when I say it\nSpit back with a rap or a gat, can I spray it\nHow can I say it? I leave it de-hydrated\nI take aim, and he keep the place flamin'\nTill the place cave in, aye yo this ain't a safe haven\nSave the playin, stay blazin with bass bangin\nThe best is yet to come, so they stay in\nThey keep the music loud, the lights is low\nThe kid with a different style, I like to flow\nIt's time to move the crowd, tonight's the show\nSee what it's all about, they like to go\nGet henny and mo and cris\nThe clothes, the platinum, gold, the wrist\nPlenty of doe, and chicks who pose for flicks\nWomen who love roll their hips, when I'm holding this\n\n[Verse 3]\nMy mic's a equipped with a microchip, with a million Megs\nBite this I might flip, spread a billion plagues\nPut medicine in it before I kill ya dead\nYou can get away, if you can feel your legs\nCould you walk? No, at least you fought though\nAuto fours blow a hole in your torso\nDamage his brain with more flow until he talk slow\nTry to say something now? I thought so!\nI leave emcee's bleeding, while I'm fleeing across sea-in\nStart breeding, double my Swiss cheese in Sweden\nFree on the weekend, come back see if he breathing\nThey breathing, somebody left his brains beat in\nA deadly attack is rare, style will be raw\nBe ready to rap you'll hear, as wild as before\nIf I bust a gat in the air, watch the galaxy fall\nAnd the world will be splat on the floor, that'll be all"}}, {"title": "It's the R", "album": "The Master", "year": "1999-11-30", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIt's Mr. Lowkey you need to go see\nThe host by far a mostly O.T\nWith a brand new show but you know how the flow be\nCause when I swerve, you observe it closely\nIf you smoke trees, smoke more than an OZ\nMix any kind of dope with me, you OD\nYou get the CD, LP, C-O-D\nPoetry cause you to fully load the V\nDrop place to place be crazy over me\nEven different nationalities, overseas\nHowever do a don't emcee, you know me\n(My name is Rakim Allah) G-O-D\nShe know she D-O-E, so show me\nEven with no jewelry she call me Goldie\nLike a Jacuzzi she overheat an OG\nLike sushi swimmin' in a open sea (I'm comin')\n\n[Instrumental Scratches]\n\"The R\"\n\"Rakim is on the mic\"\n\"I'm the R, the A, to the K-I-M\"\n\"The most popular demand and rap classic\"\n\"If I wasn't then why would I say I am?\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe said it's the same since I came and rained, it's still hard\nYou can stimulate the brain, feel the God\nIt's hard to go against the grain, it's real large\nDrive'em insane leave dames in silk bras\nPlus real cups spill, spill that bars\nWhat's the deal?

heaters\nBorn entertainer, armed with the flamer\nIf they bust shots, when they come on, its a banger\nThe place will lose it, boos shaking to it\nTrue gangster music, screw face included\nMacho lingo, the beat will remind you\nOf the quatro cinco, or Cinco de Mayo\nPut it in your car, turn the sound sky high\nDrive down the block, sound like a drive-by\nKeep chicks moving, heat keep them open\nPut them in the mood, and they leave something broken\nDJ set the scene true it in the club, soundtrack for the hood\nTheme music from a thug\n\nI told you, I'm still in love baby\n\n[Verse 2]\nBeat drop heavy every rhyme one ton\nStreets not ready hurry, nine one one\nSpot get frantic, too late to panic\nThe meteor, they can't stop from hitting the planet\nInside a nigga moral, Saddam

an artist trying to rep the hardest\nAnd make history, so not even death could part us, it's love\nI'm still in love baby, still in love\n\nIt's the god Rakim, they know I get it in\nThey pull me back in, I'm going back in\nSpitting fire, ghetto music\nGetting higher like the drug therapeutic\nHooked like an addict, strung like sex\nLook I gotta have it, it alleviates stress\nQuick as marijuana,

guns that clap outside\nTrue warrior raps my euphoria\nOnly my mind can bring me this many stories up\nNo elevators, no escalators spit hard 'til death or respirators\nThis is alpha omega nigga get

it's knocking it's disgusting\nI rather just pull it out, cock it then bust 'em\nFeels like he plugged into a socket when you touch 'em\nAin't a thang for me, pain then glory\nTemporary thug exchange the same story\nThat's why I'm still militant, still killing it\nSoon as it enters the blood stream start feeling it\nThen it's all good long as you know what you dealing with\nKnowledge of the game that I got I'm concealing it\nI'm talking to all of ya'll put the four four to ya\nKiss is a warrior, this is euphoria\n\n[Hook]\nEuphoria, Euphoria natural high\nFeeling good off this hip hop I

and the dosage when I bring the new flame\nNiggas all feeling the same effect, this shit is lethal\nLike they was shooting the same shit, using the same needle\nWhen I'm steady busting hollows I'm always ready to start this\nYou niggas is like guns busting when I'm touching the cartridge\nYou can see how the drug impacted the street from the responses\nIt saturate the planet was all apart of the process\nThe shit we get we take it to another place you can't ignore it\nTo a higher stimulation, nigga shit is so euphoric\n\n[Hook]\nEuphoria, Euphoria natural high\nFeeling good off this hip

dreams that we pursue\nWe don't think that we could lose\n\n[Verse 1]\nYa'll know what my purpose is\nI spit verses, to lift curses off my dead president worshippers\nBack where the surface is, gangsters and murderers\nMaking money made us merciless\nIt's the birth of the streets, it's over they said\nRappers crossover they dead\nI spit my verse with technique, 'til they knowing their ledge\nFirst it's too deep, then I'm over their head\nHe too lyrical, and too subliminal\nEverything from spiritual to criminal\nIt's a message in the bottle, open it\nIt's a lesson in survival, cope with it\nIt don't make sense to die, for the root of evil\nIt get too cerebral, when that loot seem legal\nEither way it's hell, I can't save the world\nBut I can show them how to save themselves from the\n\n[Hook]\nEvil things that people do\nThe illegal dreams that we pursue\nWe don't think that we could lose\nCall it cheese or cream or green or blue\nIt's the root of evil we done proved\nIt's supreme, from me to you\n\n[Verse 2]\nI see through the eyes of the prophets, King Tutankhamuns\nAnd Martin's and Malcolm's, Elijah Muhammad's\nWise and with knowledge\nPaid in full ain't just the size of the pockets\nIt's rise where the top is, rise economics\nI'll show you that time\nIs more valuable then them diamonds in your watches\nYou grind where the block is, you die for them dollars\nWhat's worth more to you? Your life or your gwop is\nThugs is pitching, chicks is in the club stripping\nFlipping drugs or pimping hood is blood or cripping\nLatin Kings and Black Guerrillas\nGovernment sits back hoping either that or crack will kill us\nIt sound like a setup and we the victims\nOne out of a million will beat the system\nGetting rich from flipping bricks is over with\nTake your chips and go legit from the\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nTo my G's on the block that do what they gotta do\nDon't get me wrong, I don't judge, I'm not knocking you\nGuess that's what not having a job will do\nPeople starving gotta get they dollars too\nGet that gwop at night, it's a lot of strife\nMy advice, is don't get blinded by the light\nDrug money and blood money got a price\nSix feet under or 25 to life\nDo a crime and you might do the time you serving\nWhat's it worth when you do a crime and get murdered\nTime is precious, time we earned it\nTime to question your grind, is it worth it\nIt's time that we change the game\nWe been waiting for change, and it came (big up Obama)\nWhy play with death, play it safe\nDo your best to stay away from the\n\n[Hook x2]"}}, {"title": "Working For You", "album": "The Seventh Seal", "year": null, "lyrics": "Yeah, let's get it cracking\n\nI've been working for you (it's for my ladies) doing all I can (all I can)\nAll the time (all the time)\nI've been working for you (it's for my hustlers) doing all I can (all I can)\nAll the time (all the time)\nI've been working for you (worldwide baby) doing all I can (all I can)\nAll the time (all the time)\nI've been working for you (yo TNT turn the mic up) doing all I can (all I can)\nAll the time\n\nListen, hey yo, what's good boo?

Cause when it come to flipping ones\nAnd getting bundles in the jungle I've got tunnel vision\nJust stay focused there's a lot of road\nI bridge the gap to get a lot of dough\nJust help me with this

ain't there something happened to me, the block is heated\nJust go in the ceilings and the boxes and the closets keep it\nI hid the yearly profits we get in the Sealy posturepedic\nI got to leave it drugs squeezing guns and the ghetto\nLast thing I wanna do is leave you a young widow\nBut the scent of papi's easy Miyagi still on the pillow\nSo I'mma find a way to survive and stay alive\nDon't let the Lexus scare you just let it just prepare you\nI spraying nine's some thorough plus I'm extra careful\nGot something good waiting for me you know I'll be there boo\nIncredible head to toe plus the

doing all I can (all I can)\nAll the time (all the time)\nI've been working for you (worldwide baby) doing all I can (all I can)\nAll the time (all the time)\nI've been working for you (yo TNT turn the mic up) doing all I can (all I can)\nAll the time\n\nListen, hey yo, what's good boo? I know I've got explaining to do\nI've got some problems but none of them pertaining to you\nIt's mostly money, bills, warrants that's just naming a few\nI ain't complaining just let me win the game and I'm through\nI get my shit together stop living off the corner\nGet the majority of my priorities in order\nAnd in my goal is find a way to get you out the slums\nSo we can roll through the neighborhood without the guns\nAnd the grind my days is limited, sinning and crime\nTime is money but you wonder how I'm spending my time\nAm I really stacking paper or I'm bending a dime\nThat's propaganda try not to let that enter your mind\nYo hon, you listening? Cause when it come to flipping ones\nAnd getting bundles in the jungle I've got tunnel vision\nJust stay focused there's a lot of road\nI bridge the gap to get a lot of dough\nJust help me with this pot of gold\nCause you was there when the feds hit me\nWe took our vows in the penals\nSo you could do my bid with me\nPrivate, visits to jail you had a kid with me\nNow it's time to get the crib with me, live with me, come on\n\nI've been working for you doing all I can (all I can)\nAll the time (all the time) (X4)\n\nIf you don't hear from me, call the priest and don't think papi cheating\nIf I ain't there something happened to me, the block is heated\nJust go in the ceilings and the boxes and the closets keep it\nI hid the yearly profits we get in the Sealy posturepedic\nI got to leave it drugs squeezing guns and the ghetto\nLast thing I wanna do is leave you a young widow\nBut the scent of papi's easy Miyagi still on the pillow\nSo I'mma find a way to survive and stay alive\nDon't let the Lexus scare you just let it just prepare you\nI spraying nine's some thorough plus I'm extra careful\nGot something good waiting for me you know I'll be there boo\nIncredible head to toe plus the sex is rare too\nGot you the cranberry benz you say yeah I'm happy\nBut you don't want nothing if you can't have me\nSo I'mma switch the gig when I get rich from this\nThen go legit and handle businesses, kiss the kids\n\nI've been working for you doing all I can (all I can)\nAll the time (all the time) (X4)\n\nI ball for you, score for you, mall for you\nI say I'm sorry, but at times I was wrong for you\nGet into your beef for you, plus, I be loyal\nI go gutter free for you, even flush a key for you\nRight now, I'm ready to change my lifestyle\nPipe down for you, lay the pipe down for you\nEven call free for you, all week for you\nLay off the heat for you, stay off the street for you\nI'll take you out for lunch, anything you want\nWithout the front for you, put out the blunt for you\nMake sure you safe and sound, stay around for you\nYou gonna love the way your man lay it down for you\nHey, yo, hey, ma, everything is\u2014uh huh, you got to know it\n\n[Outro]"}}, {"title": "I Know", "album": "The Master", "year": "1999-11-03", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nA-yo, who's the most explosive one yet?\nThe a roundest one left\nWho flows express to them rhythm drum set ain't done yet?\nFlow like a trumpet to your eardrum are deaf\nWho pose a threat?\nYo- who's more ferocious- none yet\nTo the night damn set mic trends and life ends\nIn sight, I see the whole world through a tight lens\nRhymes I write wins and kept a white Benz\nSpend G's like hundreds and hundreds like tens\nI get paid, Black, but laid back with mild manners\nWhen I flip it's the opposite of dark Bruce Banner\nOut the lab with soul and melodies in your ear\nAnd just when it all seem clear I disappear\nAll you gotta do is holler\nReappear like vol-la the street scholar\nI'm 40 deep like Ali Baba\nGive the mamas something to talk about in the beauty parlor\nKeep it hot like lava, yeah\nIt's Rakim Allah\n\n[Hook]\nI know you find it hard to believe that\nI am the genie of the mic an\nI can do anything you wish but\nRight now I'm commanding you to dance\n\n[Verse 2]\nReady to dance y'all, my magic carpet's the dance floor\nLast chance y'all even if you can't ball\nWhat part don't you understand? Your wish is my command\nAnd I'm a rock a jam by popular demand\nYou gone love this, it's marvelous, baby\nIt gotta thug's twist-it start to get crazy\nIt's off the meat rack- can't keep my peeps

little brothers and sisters\nAnd still get vicious for the thugs and the Misses\nWhat I don't do is talk about the same old thing\nWhen I come through, I drop it, and they gone swing\nI bring the ladies joy until they make crazy noise\nCuz the beat's bangin'- I'm born to blaze, baby boy\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe editor, forevermore the predator\nI set it off, spread a war like never before\nSpit literatures like a ghetto braud raw to cause ?\n'till menopause\nWith raw metaphors, I set it off\nBut I just begun the best is yet to come\nBlessed with a majestic tongue since I was young\nBut I was stressed for funds and obsessed with guns\nTest the one, let Allah protect your son\nCause I'm the musical magician, the Asiatic author\nThe microphone magician when I have a magic marker, a mentor\nYou can explore, every sentence is a tour\nThe inventor is more than adventure\nYou'll be blown away, in the zone when it play\nIt's so ill, I still grab the microphone and say\nOne of my own displays like I'm known to blaze\nAnd I bet rhyme pays until I'm old and gray\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ed0fa8170b1ec37192ad4e270a004891.500x500x1.jpg", "artist":

phone tapped, it's nothing (Yo', this what they want)\nBecause the God is back, that's something (New York City)\nThis is what it is, it's nothing, (It's what they need)\nYou thought it was a wrap, it's nothing (East Coast to West coast)\nThey got my phone tapped, it's nothing (It's what it is)\nBecause the God is back, that's something (Across sea's, world-wide, baby)\n\n[Verse 1]\nAyo, we..\nStuck in a time of drought, nothing to rhyme about\nGhetto and crime, on the grind, pulling iron out\nIndustry crying out, major labels buying out\nWho put the fire out? Real Hip-Hop is dying out\nSounds like the perfect time for Ra, set off\nA new beginning, let me finish where Nas left off\nI went to LA to get with Dre, we tried to bridge the gap in\nTake night, mix it with day, I guess it wasn't meant to happen\nI move, lotta dudes hope I lose but its cool, baby\nI'm like Ray, I make it do what it do, baby\nBounce like medallions 'til it's off the chain\nAnd I remain up in the lab 'til it's engulfed in flames\nJust call me too hot, same ol' hood look like a new spot\nA new block, like Time Square 'fore the doo-wop\nWithout the gun on my Hip I bring the new Hop\nFor Scott La Rock, Freaky Tah, L, Biggie Smalls and 2Pac, I'm back\n\n[Hook]\nThis is what it is, it's nothing\nYou thought it was a wrap, it's nothing\nThey got my phone tapped, it's

letters fill with warriors\nDeadly weapons fell before us, the Seventh Seal's upon us\nRakim won't fear, begin to fear, the end is here, you goners\nStiff as rigormortis, now let 'em feel the chorus\nWhen the God spit, I'm still a yards stick of real performance\nRecord deals and touring, my repp is still enormous\nI hit the block or party and mami's be watching papi\nA show be smashed, photographed by the paparazzi\nMy army's armed and highly, don't bring no drama by me\nIt's deadly, fill your boy with blanks, slash, kamikaze\nThe alpha and omega, no doubted innovator\nIn front of your bodega, it's the style-originator\nYou doubters and you haters, Ra 'bout to end your data\nWith Writer's Block, I'm off the top, without the pen, no paper\nThe archeologist that y'all acknowledging\nThen I start the apocalypse then watch the God demolish it\nI heard the news, this the dude they wanna hear from\nTake it from square one, lace up them Air One's\nThen bring the new commandments to the planets\nFor living life in the hood and for the music fanatics\nIt's for the time's beyond and my love for writing songs\nWhen the club mic is on, I'm on my just to cipher, bomb, I'm back\n\n[Hook]\nThis is what it is, it's nothing\nYou thought it was a wrap, it's nothing\nThey got my phone tapped, it's nothing\nBecause the God is back, that's something\nThis is what it is,

the busy Ave where we clash\nTrying to see how much gritty cash this city has\nMeantime harass every bitty that pass\nAnd then here you come with your pretty ass\nAll petite like you make ends meet on Wall Street\nYour for keeps couldn't find a woman more complete\nYou got your head on tight and when you talk I like\nFor me and you two different walks of life\nI'm in the streets too much I pack the heat too much\nPut too much trees in the Dutch and don't keep in touch\nYou try to get in contact I don't respond back\nWhere the god at come back smellin' like cognac\nBaby beware I'm tryin' my best to be fair\nAye yo-the key here is repair this love we share\nCause if we care we would prepare to see clear\nEye to eye we here as long as you be there\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nYo, I'm startin' to understand it you like your evenings enchanted\nLove is bond, organic- restaurants romantic\nWant me to take your hand and take you around the planet\nBut I take advantage and take you for granted\nCall collect explainin' why I ain't came yet\nI ain't winnin' the game yet can I get a rain check\nBlow me a kiss in the wind, I'm missin' again\nDon't let your sisters and your friends tell you this is the end\nTalk a hole in your head puttin' bugs in your ear\nMake you role in your bed when your thug ain't there\nSomewhere around ladies know I get lonely and proud\nOpen my file baby you should know me by now\nTryin' to get paid and stay away from old sites\nFind my place in life plus I like to hold mics\nIt might be seven whole days and seven whole nights\nBut yo it's gonna be alright just hold tight\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nWho said something good won't last forever\nI know too much of any thing is bad \u00ecwhatever\u00ee\nLong as we have good and bad times together\nBad times make the good times that much better\nPeaches and cream, diamonds and ice\nYou like pieces of dreams you shinin' in the night\nFeatures of a Queen and your mind frame is tight\nTimin' is right get ready for the time of your life\nYou speak about stackin' gees and havin' seeds\nApparently we know it's no guarantee\nBut losin' you boo who smooth as you\nYou unusual this is for the cool in you\nAnd for the chill I will forever come real\nYour appeal makes it hard to keep my love concealed\nAll it took was one look, one kiss, one meal\nNow come feel, let's make this a done deal\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ed0fa8170b1ec37192ad4e270a004891.500x500x1.jpg", "artist": "Rakim", "raw": {"annotation_count": 5, "api_path": "/songs/96857", "apple_music_id":

for you\nI will always be there\nI'll be there\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm bout to meet my comrade on the busy Ave where we clash\nTrying to see how much gritty cash this city has\nMeantime harass every bitty that pass\nAnd then here you come with your pretty ass\nAll petite like you make ends meet on Wall Street\nYour for keeps couldn't find a woman more complete\nYou got your head on tight and when you talk I like\nFor me and you two different walks of life\nI'm in the streets too much I pack the heat too much\nPut too much trees in the Dutch and don't keep in touch\nYou try to get in contact I don't respond back\nWhere the god at come back smellin' like cognac\nBaby beware I'm tryin' my best to be fair\nAye yo-the key here is repair this love we share\nCause if we care we would prepare to see clear\nEye to eye we here as long as you be there\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nYo, I'm startin' to understand it you like your evenings enchanted\nLove is bond, organic- restaurants romantic\nWant me to take your hand and take you around the planet\nBut I take advantage and take you for granted\nCall collect explainin' why I ain't came yet\nI ain't winnin' the game yet can I get a rain check\nBlow me a kiss in the wind, I'm missin' again\nDon't let your sisters and your friends tell you this is the end\nTalk a hole in your head puttin' bugs in your ear\nMake you role in your bed when your thug ain't there\nSomewhere around ladies know I get lonely and proud\nOpen my file baby you should know me by now\nTryin' to get paid and stay away from old sites\nFind my place in life plus I like to hold mics\nIt might be seven whole days and seven whole nights\nBut yo it's gonna be alright just hold tight\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nWho said something good won't last forever\nI know too much of any thing is bad \u00ecwhatever\u00ee\nLong as we have good and bad times together\nBad times make the good times that much better\nPeaches and cream, diamonds and ice\nYou like pieces of dreams you shinin' in the night\nFeatures of a Queen and your mind frame is tight\nTimin' is right get ready for the time of your life\nYou speak about stackin' gees and havin' seeds\nApparently we know it's no guarantee\nBut losin' you boo who smooth as you\nYou unusual this is for the cool in you\nAnd for the chill I will forever come real\nYour appeal makes it hard to keep my love concealed\nAll it took was one look, one kiss, one meal\nNow come feel, let's make this a done deal\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "Strong Island", "album": "The Master", "year": "1999-11-30", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nAnd the streets

been talking to me\nHe said he understands my view\nHe's always walking with me\nCuz he sees what I've been through\nWhen the world starts kicking me around\nAll in my face, make me want to put 'em down\nTrying to earn, trying to learn, trying to love like a man\nSometimes it feels like it's out of my hands--\n\nI'm from the hood that's forever sinning\nWhere life is took for granted here so death is winning\nNothing but blues around, feels like we're losing out\nTimes that spent in this environment confuse a child\nAs a juvenile I ran wild I ran out of blessings\nBeen in and out of prison as an adolescent\nMy goal was getting it, til something said to turn my life around\nRedirect my hustle, and go legitimate\nTil I get corporate and invest fortunes\nWith exec bosses sitting behind a desk at the office\nI'm left jobless, nobody hiring ex-convicts\nThat don't mean I'm less conscious\nIt's so hard when they close doors\nAnd when you looking like a so-called hip hoppa you get nada\nStereotyped, scarred for life stigmata\nBut still a kid's gotta get a dolla\n\n[Hook]\n\nI tackle choices every day that's hopeless\nI hear a voice saying \"stay focused\"\nFast money, cars, and broads will mislead you\nLove backwards here is evol but it's legal\nMulti-task I make a fortune faster\nKeep rhymin til I'm climbing up the corporate ladder\nIn my community, you've gotta go out of your way if you're out to get paid\nThan back up and wait for opportunity\nI try not to blame society\nI eat my pride cuz I know deep inside it's me\nBut not entirely, when a man try to live righteously\nAnd propriety turn to anxiety\nI thought I paid back the system when I stayed in prison\nLeft the stripes, see what success is like\nBut the way they set the price\nYou spent your childhood in the wild hood\nYou're in debt for life\n\n[Hook]\n\nI figured out what was talking with me\nWhen I do right I feel him walking with me\nSo I'm adamant, some call it arrogance\nI can cope it cuz I know I'm broke for having sense\nBut my back's against the wall, it's getting rough to get a buck\nIn a job with a minimum wage won't get enough\nFaced with giving up, and my lady friend's beefing\nEnds ain't meeting, we just an argument away from splitting up\nIt gets lonely, my fam disowned me\nCalled me the black sheep cuz I act street\nYea it's that deep, I tried to change clicks\nHomies flipped on me cuz I don't hang; we have beef\nBut I'm at peace so that cease, at least\nI ain't got no ties on my Porsche ride\nAnd no time for no crime, knowing that the most high\nIs

harmonizing \"da da da\" etc.*}\nUhh, like the way it's goin doin ma\nYo\n\n[Rakim]\nShe got the, type of love that entice a thug\nA tender mami, but sometimes she like it rough\nSee shorty way of thinkin is we might split up\nSo when she think it's gettin cool then she spice it up\nShe give me fever; give her chill bumps when I caress her\nAll night she never lets up, love it when she gets up\nMornin turn to night again, multiple, pleasure\nShe love playin new games and love playin dress up\nRole playin rendezvous in secluded spots\nSex in the city with views from the rooftop\nFind a cool spot stop, christenin the new drop\nIce can't keep your temperature down; you too hot\nWe do the craziest thangs and lay in the Range\nSex drive's out of control she can't stay in her lane\nShe said it turn her on when I'm sayin her name\nSo don't stop ma I'm playin your game - should I tell her?\n\n[Chorus: repeat 2X]\nI like it love, you know just what I want\nYou know just what to flaunt you got the psychic love\nType of love make a thug wanna wife it up\nWhen papi play it cool she seek to spice it up\n\n[Rakim]\nWe havin fun now; feelin and diggin hon's style\nShe creative - let her imaginations run wild\nPut me on, make sure I come back for more\nShe like \"Damn boo, I never done that before\"\nShe wearin outfits and lingerie and appear sweeter\nThe stewardess suit, the NBA cheerleader\nPersonal secretary night workin type skirts\nThe live-in maid or my favorite, the night nurse (I like that)\nShe take me out to public spots and get smoochy\nSex in the restaurant that sound gooshy\nSneak me in the cinema she said she wanna do me\nAs they play the Saturday matinee movie\nThe broad play right, quiet spot in the park\nBroad daylight, sex is what she call play fight\nAnd I'll be ready, whenever she put it on me again\nThe object is she want me to win - should I tell her?\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Outro]\nYeah\nAiyyo Nick Wiz just\nJust let it ride out\nY'knahmean?\nJust let it go from there man\nWhile my mami sit back\nLet your hair down, let's go\nUhh, uhh, yeah", "image":

superstars\nBoys on the block\nThugs in the hood we don't never stop\nNever stop\n\n[Verse 1]\nI go where the masses go\nWe all act natural\nThink rational\nThose with a passion blow\nCats have to know\nMaster your craft\nStash your dough\nStay on the low\nBut never be the last to know\nThe next level or plateau be international\nThe grass'll grow\nYou know\nCash'll flow\nAsk a pro\nDo the math\nGet it fast or slow\nYour girl's passin gold like a fashion show\nThe sun'll shine\nMake it feel like the summertime\nShorty's runnin' blind\nLookin like they just done a crime\nClick's want they pockets thick\nCop a whip\nProper chick\nStreet scholarships\nPolitic your dollars quick\nSince birth we __\nCuz we was the first in the pack\nThey say \"herb's a trap\"\nNow it's worse than that\nSo I observe the haps'\nLet my words attack\nUntil it hurts to rap\nUntil the earth collapsed\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou know it seem like life's just begun\nMy lust is young\nI wanna find me a lovely hon\nCrush me one\nBust a lung\nGive her mouth to mouth resuscitation\nLet her hug\nAnd when I'm done\nTongue touch me 'til I'm numb\nBut first the outcome is income and then some\nGet enough to run and spend some for fun\nThen me and my thugs\nWe come in the club\nWe swung lovely\nWatch how big the buzz be\nTrust me son\nEvery ghetto got game in it\nFame in it\nWe remain in it\nWaitin for the main event\nLike the days on the corner\nWe watch the world go by\nOn the nights that wasn't right\nLike when a good friend died\nYo the street's got a deadly hum\nLike a drug\nWe gotta find a way to fill the neighborhood with love\nFrom the park to the block\nTo your favorite spot\nIt don't stop\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI spend the prowl(?)\nI been on since a child\nIt don't make sense to browse\nIt's intensive now\nWomen in crowds\nI search for the gem in the Nile\nWho stay original\nEven when the friends around\nSince her style\nAlways commands a smile\nAnd her femme fatale\nCause men to growl\nI take percent of the principals\nThen arouse\nStill the treasure is Rakim\nThe smooth criminal\nDamn, it's on\nKeep my hands on\nThis amazon\nLegs for marathons\nVoice like Sarah Vaughan\nPrecise, alright\nI like when her sights entice\nWith a spice of life\nFlow times twice as nice\nAnd when she go shop\nThe show stop\nShock the whole block\nShe so hot\nI clothes shop\nPut it on lock\nBody that won't drop\nBounce like hip-hop\nIt don't stop\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "Freestyle", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "Lyrics make me a menace\nWhen it's in a sentence then

the Earth spun\nHe said it's cursed; so he went and got his first gun\nHe turned savage, took matters in his own hands\nHe said \"I'm grown, nothing matters; I'm my own man;\nBecause we don't know how to live but we know how to die\nThe game of life and no one'll make it out alive\"\nSo I'mma stay in heavy arm and I'mma keep a gun\nAnd I'mma beg for dear life when the reaper come\nYo, he's a beast, everybody in the streets fear him\nThugs won't cross him, cops won't go near him\nNothing could scare him,  it's time to try and get rich\nHe robbed his suppliers plus he gets hired for hits\nNow the mice want his bread, it's the price on his head\nAnd everybody that he didn't like want him dead\nI guess he knew the same streets you rep on\nWill be the same streets you meet your death on\n\n[Hook]\nI used to be a stick-up kid\nSo I think of all the devious things I did\n\nVerse two is how a little dude flipped, and grew too quick\nHe did some rude shit and got his hands on two bricks\nBought the new fifth, with the extra two clips\nPut together two cliques and took over two strips\nDude glued chips, new kicks and new whips\nKnew tricks, got two kids by two chicks\nBut he blew too quick, they said he shoot too quick\nToo slick, but the cops are deep, but he got beef\nHe said \"I gotta hit the block for my needs\"\nBut I'mma leave the block 'cuz this hot cop is watching the streets\nMade a couple stops at the spot and bought trees\nHe copped a new uptown patent leather Dashik\nToo sick, now let me hit the hood\nTo stop by and make sure the kids are good\nThat's when the man ran up on him put the gat in his face\nSaid \"Remember me from back in the day?\"\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/12274a01e283e588c2db4b6ae684d1bd.300x300x1.jpg", "artist":

nothing matters; I'm my own man;\nBecause we don't know how to live but we know how to die\nThe game of life and no one'll make it out alive\"\nSo I'mma stay in heavy arm and I'mma keep a gun\nAnd I'mma beg for dear life when the reaper come\nYo, he's a beast, everybody in the streets fear him\nThugs won't cross him, cops won't go near him\nNothing could scare him,  it's time to try and get rich\nHe robbed his suppliers plus he gets hired for hits\nNow the mice want his bread, it's the price on his head\nAnd everybody that he didn't like want him dead\nI guess he knew the same streets you rep on\nWill be the same streets you meet your death on\n\n[Hook]\nI used to be a stick-up kid\nSo I think of all the devious things I did\n\nVerse two is how a little dude flipped, and grew too quick\nHe did some rude shit and got his hands on two bricks\nBought the new fifth, with the extra two clips\nPut together two cliques and took over two strips\nDude glued chips, new kicks and new whips\nKnew tricks, got two kids by two chicks\nBut he blew too quick, they said he shoot too quick\nToo slick, but the cops are deep, but he got beef\nHe said \"I gotta hit the block for my needs\"\nBut I'mma leave the block 'cuz this hot cop is watching the streets\nMade a couple stops at the spot and bought trees\nHe copped a new uptown patent leather Dashik\nToo sick, now let me hit the hood\nTo stop by and make sure the kids are good\nThat's when the man ran up on him put the gat in his face\nSaid \"Remember me from back in the day?\"\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "Intro", "album":

like\nPut it all to music\nMakes you feel exactly like\nPut it all to music\nMakes you feel exactly like\nPut it all to music\nDon't it drive you crazy\n\n[Verse 1]\nI usually fall asleep on it and wake up to it\nIn the morning draw plans in the day up to it\nAnd make it easy to cope and say just do it\nLike all I hear is c-notes it's cake up music\nGet your weight up work out and shape up to it\nIt make me hype for ladies like to shake butt to it\nWe crank up music just to make us lose it\n(Don't it drive you crazy)\nAnd nothing can match the brain rush you get\nAnd save plush you flip when playing something too sick\nYou can bug to it or make love to it\nSometimes we break up to it just to make up to it\nA safe drug, no one knows what makes us use it\nAnd make us love music though the hate run through it\nIt's the soundtrack of life turn the bass up to it\n(Don't it drive you crazy)\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt goes good with the hoods and parks and on the block\nPerfect for parties and get-togethers if you want it hot\nFix your swag if it's on or not\nGet your game right when your plan is you don't want to stop\nFeel like life is lost and then you found it\nIt make you feel a certain way there's nothing you can do about it\nIt feel like you fiending and you can't do without it\n(Don't it drive you crazy)\nIt put you in the zone when you listen to it\nIt's like a gang you can't get out when you get into it\nMemories blend and vision to it\nIt's like a throw back you can go back reminiscing to it\nYou taking it out of your mind it's stuck in your mug\nYou under an influence of an infinite buzz\nIt's like a hippy from the sixties when you mix it with drugs\n(Don't it drive you crazy)\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nEverything go better with music it's tailored for life it's better suited\nWhatever your personal preference is, rock or all the ghetto music\nYour personal therapist music it's therapeutic\nSit back in a chair and vibe out\nAnd just relax and clear your mind out\nAnd the beat will make you put it in gear and ride out\n(Don't it drive you crazy)\nIt make the scenery more vivid for me I can see\nEverything is more appealing to the eye to me\nIt even help a movie tell a story properly\nStep by step so a move I choreography\nYou can unwind to it, wine and dine to it\nPass time to it, shine or grind to it\nLike when I put my mind to it, put a rhyme to it\n(Don't it drive you crazy)\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0a5928958bdda95a9493e76a22eeb4be.588x540x1.jpg", "artist": "Rakim", "raw": {"annotation_count": 14, "api_path":

it all to music\nDon't it drive you crazy\n\n[Verse 1]\nI usually fall asleep on it and wake up to it\nIn the morning draw plans in the day up to it\nAnd make it easy to cope and say just do it\nLike all I hear is c-notes it's cake up music\nGet your weight up work out and shape up to it\nIt make me hype for ladies like to shake butt to it\nWe crank up music just to make us lose it\n(Don't it drive you crazy)\nAnd nothing can match the brain rush you get\nAnd save plush you flip when playing something too sick\nYou can bug to it or make love to it\nSometimes we break up to it just to make up to it\nA safe drug, no one knows what makes us use it\nAnd make us love music though the hate run through it\nIt's the soundtrack of life turn the bass up to it\n(Don't it drive you crazy)\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt goes good with the hoods and parks and on the block\nPerfect for parties and get-togethers if you want it hot\nFix your swag if it's on or not\nGet your game right when your plan is you don't want to stop\nFeel like life is lost and then you found it\nIt make you feel a certain way there's nothing you can do about it\nIt feel like you fiending and you can't do without it\n(Don't it drive you crazy)\nIt put you in the zone when you listen to it\nIt's like a gang you can't get out when you get into it\nMemories blend and vision to it\nIt's like a throw back you can go back reminiscing to it\nYou taking it out of your mind it's stuck in your mug\nYou under an influence of an infinite buzz\nIt's like a hippy from the sixties when you mix it with drugs\n(Don't it drive you crazy)\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nEverything go better with music it's tailored for life it's better suited\nWhatever your personal preference is, rock or all the ghetto music\nYour personal therapist music it's therapeutic\nSit back in a chair and vibe out\nAnd just relax and clear your mind out\nAnd the beat will make you put it in gear and ride out\n(Don't it drive you crazy)\nIt make the scenery more vivid for me I can see\nEverything is more appealing to the eye to me\nIt even help a movie tell a story properly\nStep by step so a move I choreography\nYou can unwind to it, wine and dine to it\nPass time to it, shine or grind to it\nLike when I put my mind to it, put a rhyme to it\n(Don't it drive you crazy)\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "New York To Cali",

provide a worldwide request and manifest\nAnd this is from the East to the West\n\n[Hook]\nFrom New York to Cali (to Cali, to Cali)\nCoast to coast, I been rippin' coliseums and clubs\nFrom New York to Cali (to Cali, to Cali)\nRhymin' over dubs for thugs, girls blow me kisses and throw me hugs\nFrom New York to Cali (to Cali, to Cali)\nCoast to coast, I been rippin' coliseums and clubs\nFrom New York to Cali (to Cali, to Cali)\nRhymin' over dubs for thugs, girls blow me kisses and throw me hugs\n\n[Outro]\nBack in the Nine to Five, you know what I'm sayin'?\nComin' with the butters, you know what I'm sayin'?\nIt's Rakim Allah, nothin' sayin' but the year\nCoast to coast, I been rippin' coliseums and clubs\nRhymin' over dubs for thugs, girls blow me kisses and throw me hugs\nCoast to coast, I been rippin' coliseums and clubs"}}, {"title": "Heat It Up", "album": "Gunmen (1994) Soundtrack", "year": "1994-02-04", "lyrics": "[Hook] 2X\nI keep the mic hot, I heat it up, kid\nI keep the

Rakim]\nFollow procedures, the crowd couldn't wait to see this\nNobody been this long awaited since Jesus\nWho wouldn't believe this - I heard the word on the street is\nI'm still one of the deepest on the mic since Adidas\nThey said I changed the times from the rhymes that I thought of\nSo I made some more to put the New World in Order\nWith Mathematics, put your status above the average\nAnd help you rappers, make paragraphs with graphics\nCause new days is dawning, new ways of performing\nBrainstorming, I write and watch the night turn to morning\nOn and on and, I got the whole world responding\nRa, I keep it hot and blow the spot without warning\nThe Emperor, well known for, inventing a sentence\nFull of adventure, turning up the temperature\nRush with adrenaline, how long has it been again\nTo be in the state of mind that Rakim is in?\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2 - Rakim]\nWhen I'm out propping - either hanging or shopping\nPeople see me stop and ask me when the album dropping\nThe wait is over, in formation like a soldier\nLike I told ya, greater stronger, now that I'm older\nI broke the, code of silence with overloads of talents\nMy only challenge, is not to explode in violence\nI'm Asiatic, and blazing microphones a habit\nAt least once during the course of a day, it's automatic\nIn ghetto apparel, mind of a Egyptian Pharoah\nFar from shallow, thoughts travel like an arrow\nAllah's monotony, so far they can't stop me\nYou know, Ra want property like Mumar Khadafi\nMore thoughts than Bibles, recital - taught disciples\nA sawed off mic, so words scatter like a rifle\nThoughts that's trifle, I'm busting these for you\nAiyyo, technical difficulties is through\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3 - Rakim]\nWhen I flow at night, I show them new heights, I go to write\nThey know I strike with new prototypes to blow the mic\nCritics and biters, don't know where my source of light is\nStill leave authors and writers with arthritis\nCursed kids like the Pyramids when they found the style\nFirst to ever let a rhyme flow down the Nile\nThe rebirth of hip-hop'll be dropped now\nCause the crowd didn't hear the original in a while\nSo be alarmed, what you bout to see is the bomb\nLike, 3-D in 'Nam, vivid like CD-Rom\nInfo kept like \"internet.com\"\nMy note-book's my bond like the Holy Qu'ran\nSince I came in the door, said it before\nBut no I ain't down with Eric B. no more\nAt night the open mic be inviting me to rhyme\nSo, yo, I'm online: it's been a long time", "image": "https://images.genius.com/623e8b053d42f096f389fcd0d63e9f2c.950x950x1.jpg", "artist": "Rakim",

"lyrics": "[HOOK]\nIt's Been A Long Time(Rakim)\nIt's Been A Long Time(Rakim)\n\n[Verse 1 - Rakim]\nFollow procedures, the crowd couldn't wait to see this\nNobody been this long awaited since Jesus\nWho wouldn't believe this - I heard the word on the street is\nI'm still one of the deepest on the mic since Adidas\nThey said I changed the times from the rhymes that I thought of\nSo I made some more to put the New World in Order\nWith Mathematics, put your status above the average\nAnd help you rappers, make paragraphs with graphics\nCause new days is dawning, new ways of performing\nBrainstorming, I write and watch the night turn to morning\nOn and on and, I got the whole world responding\nRa, I keep it hot and blow the spot without warning\nThe Emperor, well known for, inventing a sentence\nFull of adventure, turning up the temperature\nRush with adrenaline, how long has it been again\nTo be in the state of mind that Rakim is in?\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2 - Rakim]\nWhen I'm out propping - either hanging or shopping\nPeople see me stop and ask me when the album dropping\nThe wait is over, in formation like a soldier\nLike I told ya, greater stronger, now that I'm older\nI broke the, code of silence with overloads of talents\nMy only challenge, is not to explode in violence\nI'm Asiatic, and blazing microphones a habit\nAt least once during the course of a day, it's automatic\nIn ghetto apparel, mind of a Egyptian Pharoah\nFar from shallow, thoughts travel like an arrow\nAllah's monotony, so far they can't stop me\nYou know, Ra want property like Mumar Khadafi\nMore thoughts than Bibles, recital - taught disciples\nA sawed off mic, so words scatter like a rifle\nThoughts that's trifle, I'm busting these for you\nAiyyo, technical difficulties is through\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3 - Rakim]\nWhen I flow at night, I show them new heights, I go to write\nThey know I strike with new prototypes to blow the mic\nCritics and biters, don't know where my source of light is\nStill leave authors and writers with arthritis\nCursed kids like the Pyramids when they found the style\nFirst to ever let a rhyme flow down the Nile\nThe rebirth of hip-hop'll be dropped now\nCause the crowd didn't hear the original in a while\nSo be alarmed, what you bout to see is the bomb\nLike, 3-D in 'Nam, vivid like CD-Rom\nInfo kept like \"internet.com\"\nMy note-book's my bond like the Holy Qu'ran\nSince I came in the door, said it before\nBut no I ain't down with Eric B. no more\nAt night the open mic be inviting me to rhyme\nSo, yo, I'm online: it's been a long time"}}, {"title": "Living for the City", "album": "Unreleased Studio Set", "year": null, "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIn the city where life is animated with colors\nContaminated with aggravated brothers, who knows where the love is?\nGrowing up swinging, through my upbringing\nMy limits is the sky from the all eye seeing\nOf so-called realities filled with technicalities\nI watch my steps, stay on my p's and check my casualties\nNot to get played, equipped with all the tricks of the trade\nI even learned from the mistakes that the next man made\nI know to choose and pick the people I grow up around\nI know to grow and get to know the town up and down\nBut there's no instructions, so many directions\nA lot of crooks look to get hooked with connections\nSome thought they knew all adolescence could teach\nThey graduated from school but fail life in the streets\nYour pops taught you to strive and stay a live, no ditty\nIt's easy to die when you're living for the city\n\n[Hook]\nThat's how I'm living\nThat's how I'm living\nThat's how I'm living\nYeah that's how I'm living\n\n[Verse 2]\nI grow according to my environmental habitat\nI hang where everything seem to happen at\nI seen it all, and I've been doing that since I was small\nCatch a flashback y'all, if I can recall\nThe days on the corner we watched the world go by\nOr nights that wasn't right like when a good friend dies\nI quest for the best for prepare for the worst\nNever scared but I cared if I'm blessed or I'm cursed\nYes I fear no man but Allah\nI'm Gomar Oz Dubar\nWhich is God so It's hard to see Ra\nI do what I gotta do, with or without a clue\nRun through any obstacle including you\nCause I ain't got to bust you, cause I got the muscle\nA push any clown that tries to slow down my hustle\nI gotta get by, but there's no time for pity\nIt's easy to die when you're living for the city\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm in a zone everywhere I seem to roam is home\nA rolling stone, I hold my own just like a microphone\nI stay in tune, travel in harmony and set the tone\nBeing young but I'm grown and well-known\nTry to take me out New York but you can't take New York out of me\nCause that's the only way that I know how to be\nMy neighbors is jealous they label us drug sellers\nWe may be hood dwellers, we're just a bunch of goodfellas\nCause we run wild with a passion, my style and my fashion\nIs getting, kid, I'm making cash and crashing\nParties that everybody's talking about, we turn it out\nI'm just a native New Yorker with clout\nI know my way around any borough and any town\nI make a lot of ground and I'm hard to be found\nI get down to the nitty gritty, wake up with something pretty\nIt gets me through another day living for the city\n\n[Hook]", "image":

when you're living for the city\n\n[Hook]\nThat's how I'm living\nThat's how I'm living\nThat's how I'm living\nYeah that's how I'm living\n\n[Verse 2]\nI grow according to my environmental habitat\nI hang where everything seem to happen at\nI seen it all, and I've been doing that since I was small\nCatch a flashback y'all, if I can recall\nThe days on the corner we watched the world go by\nOr nights that wasn't right like when a good friend dies\nI quest for the best for prepare for the worst\nNever scared but I cared if I'm blessed or I'm cursed\nYes I fear no man but Allah\nI'm Gomar Oz Dubar\nWhich is God so It's hard to see Ra\nI do what I gotta do, with or without a clue\nRun through any obstacle including you\nCause I ain't got to bust you, cause I got the muscle\nA push any clown that tries to slow down my hustle\nI gotta get by, but there's no time for pity\nIt's easy to die when you're living for the city\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm in a zone everywhere I seem to roam is home\nA rolling stone, I hold my own just like a microphone\nI stay in tune, travel in harmony and set the tone\nBeing young but I'm grown and well-known\nTry to take me out New York but you can't take New York out of me\nCause that's the only way that I know how to be\nMy neighbors is jealous they label us drug sellers\nWe may be hood dwellers, we're just a bunch of goodfellas\nCause we run wild with a passion, my style and my fashion\nIs getting, kid, I'm making cash and crashing\nParties that everybody's talking about, we turn it out\nI'm just a native New Yorker with clout\nI know my way around any borough and any town\nI make a lot of ground and I'm hard to be found\nI get down to the nitty gritty, wake up with something pretty\nIt gets me through another day living for the city\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "I Get Visual", "album": "Unreleased Studio Set", "year": null, "lyrics": "(Keep you goin' when I'm flowin' smooth enough)\nYes Yes Y'all, I still fiend by any means a

same\nWhoever gets caught\nGot to take the blame\nWe gon' take the train, take the train\n\nTake it to the maximum (3x)\nRakim: Take it to the maximum\n\nRakim:\nThe train's been highjacked on track\nAnd never come back\nThe express, the last stop is where the fun's at\nI got my friends\nA car full of hostages\nTo the destination\nThey'll be lots of kids\nEnough said\nTake it full steam ahead\n\nI give extreme direction to the team of fed\nWe ain't a breeze\nOnce we hit top speed they gonna panic\nBut it's aerodynamic\nScream across the planet\n\nEngines go against a airforce wind\nAdrenaline\nMake sure the trail of force won't end\nThe third rail prevails\nWe don't pretend to spin\nNext question is when will the fun begin\n\nWhat will we get there\nDouble the kicks\nHurry up\nBecause we can get in trouble for this\nSpeeding the Rugrats and them we have to come\nTake it to the maximum\n\nAll in together lets make a game\nWe can all win if we play the same\nWhoever gets caught got to take the blame\nWe gon' take the train, take the train\n\nTake it to the maximum (3x)\nCome On\nRakim: Take it to the maximum (2x)\n\nRakim:\nKeep it moving\nIs this the fastest this thing can go? (No)\nDid we lose them?\nSpeed it up\nWe're going too slow\nWhere's the turbo button at? (Right here\nI'ma push it)\nAnymore juice that can boost the blow\n\nStand back give me that\nI'ma play a game\nLet's see who can gain on the runaway train\nEverything is real\nSo I know I'll win\nWhile you wish you could\nI know I can\n\nIt's action pack\nI was meant for this\nHigh energy and adventurous\nLook around\nWe're going faster than the speed of sound\nAnymore faster and we'll leave the ground\n\nDay designed\nOutlined the curve\nWe zig-and-zag till we start to swerve\nSpeeding the Rugrats and them we have to come\nTake it to the maximum\n\nAll in together lets make a game\nWe can all win if we play the same\nWhoever gets caught got to take the blame\nWe gon' take the train, take the train\n\nTake it to the maximum (3x)\nRakim: Take it to the maximum (2x)\n\nRakim:\nYo, Yo, take it to the maximum, yaknahmean?\nAnd right now I want to give a major shout out to my little peoples\nTo Otis, Arlo, Gabby, Little Jamie, Jerdy, Jay, Justin, Jared\n\nDanny Saber:\nRuby, Brandon, Cory, Donny, Tyler, Jake, Lucy, Medio\n\nRakim:\nTo little people's\nTymel, Destiny, and Jabbar\nOne Love, Get your Rugrat on\nYaknahmean\nPeace\nTake it to the maximum\n\nTake it to the maximum (5x)"}}, {"title": "Once Upon A Rhyme", "album": "The Cellar EP", "year": null, "lyrics": "I kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, then I jet\n\nOnce upon a rhyme, the time late 60s, dark age of history\nMurders and mysteries, the future was misty\nNeedles were shot down and crime was risky\nYo check this party and stick with me\nRace brutality because of my nationality\nAnd this is what they call reality\nFrom that state of mind and at that date and time\nI was born inclined and waiting to shine\nOnce upon a rhyme\n\nOnce upon a time not long ago\nOnce upon a time not long ago\n\nThe beginning, the scenery sets in New York\nWith times are hard and streets ain't easy to walk\nCrimes is underrated, neighborhoods overpopulated\nCompetition gets complicated, some can't take it\nMy place of rest in the city that never sleeps\nTo compete it gets deep I learn to play for keeps\nAnd hawk the sidewalk, dominate the court\nI'm nice in all sports, was taught with high thoughts\nThen came an Africans and knew where it was at\nSpreadin' across the map with no time flat\nThey said this kid name Herc started spinning records back\nHad to look into that then get it down pat\nFirst I do research it's gonna take time\nMe and my crew is hittin' all the parties we could find\nWaitin' for the day where I could go for mine\nBut later dates await down the line\nOnce upon a rhyme\n\nOnce upon a time not long ago\nOnce upon a time not long ago\n\nMany shall come but only few get the plot off the top\nYou gotta be hip to hop and get visual\nWith musical forms, lyrical pictures from city slickers\nBeats getting blast by ass kickers\nIt was the pioneers with all kinda ideas\nTrade will shift to higher gears over the years\nSome get left in the dust by the thrust\nIf rhymes won't bust with a mic full of rust\nDJs, get your fingers musically amputated\nYou can't touch a jam if the next man slayed it\nBattle at the center, I'm too young too enter\nWe cool outside, even in the winter\nWe have a good time with the people on line\nAnd party time seem like the neighborhood shine\nBut I get vexed when I can't get mine\nBut later dates await down the line\nOnce upon a rhyme\n\nOnce upon a time not long ago\nOnce upon a time not long ago\n\nI kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, then I jet\nI kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, then I jet\n\nThrough the times my rhymes got longer\nMind got stronger, wonder I'd ever be a performer\nMy blood starts to boil I could heat up the party for you\nGirls wanna rub me and my mic down with oil\nRappers started coming out the woodwork\nA neighborhood expert, we ready for trouble and stay alert\nDays got close til my debut got recruited to a crew\nNow I could do the things I always wanted to\nCode red I inherited, many ways to say the unsaid\nBorn with three 7's in my head\nBlessed it, destined to be one of the best and\nAnything I find interesting yeah no question\nA swift kid I get lifted by the mind\nGifted skills exist to be on my prime\nCombined with all kinds of designs which is mine\nIts showtimes await down the line\nOnce upon a rhyme\n\nOnce upon a time not long ago\nOnce upon a time not long ago", "image": "https://images.genius.com/da6527541cc4f304603c5d9a0dacccff.478x486x1.jpg", "artist": "Rakim", "raw": {"annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/3223838", "apple_music_id":

kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, then I jet\n\nOnce upon a rhyme, the time late 60s, dark age of history\nMurders and mysteries, the future was misty\nNeedles were shot down and crime was risky\nYo check this party and stick with me\nRace brutality because of my nationality\nAnd this is what they call reality\nFrom that state of mind and at that date and time\nI was born inclined and waiting to shine\nOnce upon a rhyme\n\nOnce upon a time not long ago\nOnce upon a time not long ago\n\nThe beginning, the scenery sets in New York\nWith times are hard and streets ain't easy to walk\nCrimes is underrated, neighborhoods overpopulated\nCompetition gets complicated, some can't take it\nMy place of rest in the city that never sleeps\nTo compete it gets deep I learn to play for keeps\nAnd hawk the sidewalk, dominate the court\nI'm nice in all sports, was taught with high thoughts\nThen came an Africans and knew where it was at\nSpreadin' across the map with no time flat\nThey said this kid name Herc started spinning records back\nHad to look into that then get it down pat\nFirst I do research it's gonna take time\nMe and my crew is hittin' all the parties we could find\nWaitin' for the day where I could go for mine\nBut later dates await down the line\nOnce upon a rhyme\n\nOnce upon a time not long ago\nOnce upon a time not long ago\n\nMany shall come but only few get the plot off the top\nYou gotta be hip to hop and get visual\nWith musical forms, lyrical pictures from city slickers\nBeats getting blast by ass kickers\nIt was the pioneers with all kinda ideas\nTrade will shift to higher gears over the years\nSome get left in the dust by the thrust\nIf rhymes won't bust with a mic full of rust\nDJs, get your fingers musically amputated\nYou can't touch a jam if the next man slayed it\nBattle at the center, I'm too young too enter\nWe cool outside, even in the winter\nWe have a good time with the people on line\nAnd party time seem like the neighborhood shine\nBut I get vexed when I can't get mine\nBut later dates await down the line\nOnce upon a rhyme\n\nOnce upon a time not long ago\nOnce upon a time not long ago\n\nI kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, then I jet\nI kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, then I jet\n\nThrough the times my rhymes got longer\nMind got stronger, wonder I'd ever be a performer\nMy blood starts to boil I could heat up the party for you\nGirls wanna rub me and my mic down with oil\nRappers started coming out the woodwork\nA neighborhood expert, we ready for trouble and stay alert\nDays got close til my debut got recruited to a crew\nNow I could do the things I always wanted to\nCode red I inherited, many ways to say the unsaid\nBorn with three 7's in my head\nBlessed it, destined to be one of the best and\nAnything I find interesting yeah no question\nA swift kid I get lifted by the mind\nGifted skills exist to be on my prime\nCombined with all kinds of designs which is mine\nIts showtimes await down the line\nOnce upon a rhyme\n\nOnce upon a time not long ago\nOnce upon a time not long ago"}}, {"title": "Outro (The 18th Letter)", "album": "The 18th Letter",

above the law\nI don't go on tour, I go to war\nStompin' COMP perform a similar style\nRhymes attack 91 rap exile\nCause every word I said'll be deadly\nAn MC murderer, science is steadily\nGiving me new ways and methods\nMelodies and medleys, weapons for records\nTactics lethal, perhaps it's illegal\nScorching, I'm torching cause that's how we do\nSet your entire empire on fire\nSo give me a mic without a wire\nCause every dose is highly explosive\nMr. Dynamite, the man with most of\nThe blueprints and master plans, the potential\nData process stored in the mental\nThen I get physical and hit you with another hit\nThe brother's it, and nothing's equivalent\n\nVerse 2\n\nMind of mine so divine, one of a kind\nLife gave lemonade, I made my flavor green lime\nChasing the green light in a hot pursuit\nRockin\u2019  em\u2019 baggy jeans and construction boots\nSoul Survivor, able to put out the fire lit by Cain (Kane)\nIdeas turn to golden weapons, Suddam Hussein\nAlpha to Omega, I was the inventa\u2019 of hip-hop\nPushed in the door with my big toe like I was slippin\u2019 on flip flops\nThe creator, raps initiator since its Genesis\nCheck the First Testament\nThe God who created the worlds elements with precise measurements\nRakim Allah absorbs your detriments, and writes a verse\nSo influential I eliminate your devilish thirst\nThe games been cursed and I\u2019m the magician\nLeave opponents in a hearse for trying to claim first position\nGod incarnate, the marksman sergeant\nTeach em\u2019 where to aim to hit their goals and targets\nI fathered this rap game, plain and simple\nIncorporated hip-hop with poetry and riddles\nMy mind is so deep sharks can\u2019t swim with my thoughts\nWhale (Will) they swim to the shallow with the fishes and lobs.,\nIt don\u2019t matter, the underground still too hard to survive\nI could swim under the sea with the beasts and be the only one still alive\nDo or die if you scuba dive in the league I roam\nTurn hardcore rappers into sponges and Styrofoam\nI stand alone, the messenger to slay the monster\nFrom Moses parting the Red Sea to me, the Godfather\nRakim Allah\u2026..\n\nFirst Verse Written by Rakim. Second Verse Written by Patrick Yousif as if he was Rakim and spoke from Rakim Allah's point of view in the rap game. Just having some fun trying to imitate Rakim's style.

what time it is,  what time it was and what time it's gonna be\nIt's Rakim Allah and Easy Mo Bee ya know what I'm sayin'\nAnd this how we get down\nRepresentin'\nCheck it out\nFor the Black Panthers\nIt's gonna get set like this\n\n(Verse 1)\nWe're dealing with some devious days\nBut believe me it's ways\nOf posing tact for those that act mischievous pays\nFoes in town is bound to hold you down\nPhysically your baddest when you hold your ground\nAnd let loose the hounds\nAnd double barrel scatters the thunder\nWhen I stand they want me to be under\nSee the government wanna remove the G and be over me\nMake more men and still live life free\nAnd leave me for sorrow\nNot promised tomorrow\nA job, a house, or a chance to show what I know\nI'm out to crusade, all I got is the streets\nCuz I've been waitin' for opportunity to knock for weeks\nIf he come, tell him I went to organize\nAnd enterprise unity in the community and rise\nThat means take it back\nWhoever's against that, then we attack\nWith various shades of black\n\nWhen we attack, with various shades of black\n\n(Verse 2)\nLost in North America, stressed and led astray\nIn search of light so I could see a better day\nOr maybe I could look from off the mountain top\nA great king got dropped cuz he found the spot\nHe said umm \"My eyes have seen the becoming\"\nAnd that's the very last speech that we heard from him\nBut I'ma remain on the scene and reign supreme\nAnd go through many extremes, by any means\nBut I don't need a military, I'm ill already\nI kill and bury with an aim still and steady\nSo bring me a bomb and ring the alarm\nWhen I do harm I leave more dead than 'Nam\nMore casualties, more tragedies\nOn the mission to seize races, nationalities\nAnd if it gotta be like that, then we attack\nWith various shades of black\n\nVarious shades of black\n\nIt shouldn't have to be like that\n\n(Verse 3)\nWe got to travel in harmony, in tune with the movement\nMake moves in unison all crews represent\nCome together for the common cause for mine and yours\nFix the broken laws and open doors\nWe want in, or let the revolution begin\nWe've been beat before but this time we'll win\nIt's gonna take bravery to stop slavery\nAnd days'll be full of flave and carefree\nIt's different now, the predicament I'm in\nJudge with a grudge just cuz the color of my skin\nRace brutality because of my nationality\nAnd this is what they call reality\nIt's political, hypocritical, uncorrect\nFirst I get lyrical then we come for wreck\nLet's take control, they can't hold us back\nAnd let's attack, with various shades of black\n\nThis part of the revolution is gonna be televised\nYa-know-what-I'm-sayin'\nThis is Rakim Allah\nMy man Easy Moe Bee kept the flow\nYa-know-what-I'm-sayin'\nThe last platoon coming to through your neighborhood ?\nAin't nothin' change but the year\nFor '95 so c'mon", "image":

down\nRepresentin'\nCheck it out\nFor the Black Panthers\nIt's gonna get set like this\n\n(Verse 1)\nWe're dealing with some devious days\nBut believe me it's ways\nOf posing tact for those that act mischievous pays\nFoes in town is bound to hold you down\nPhysically your baddest when you hold your ground\nAnd let loose the hounds\nAnd double barrel scatters the thunder\nWhen I stand they want me to be under\nSee the government wanna remove the G and be over me\nMake more men and still live life free\nAnd leave me for sorrow\nNot promised tomorrow\nA job, a house, or a chance to show what I know\nI'm out to crusade, all I got is the streets\nCuz I've been waitin' for opportunity to knock for weeks\nIf he come, tell him I went to organize\nAnd enterprise unity in the community and rise\nThat means take it back\nWhoever's against that, then we attack\nWith various shades of black\n\nWhen we attack, with various shades of black\n\n(Verse 2)\nLost in North America, stressed and led astray\nIn search of light so I could see a better day\nOr maybe I could look from off the mountain top\nA great king got dropped cuz he found the spot\nHe said umm \"My eyes have seen the becoming\"\nAnd that's the very last speech that we heard from him\nBut I'ma remain on the scene and reign supreme\nAnd go through many extremes, by any means\nBut I don't need a military, I'm ill already\nI kill and bury with an aim still and steady\nSo bring me a bomb and ring the alarm\nWhen I do harm I leave more dead than 'Nam\nMore casualties, more tragedies\nOn the mission to seize races, nationalities\nAnd if it gotta be like that, then we attack\nWith various shades of black\n\nVarious shades of black\n\nIt shouldn't have to be like that\n\n(Verse 3)\nWe got to travel in harmony, in tune with the movement\nMake moves in unison all crews represent\nCome together for the common cause for mine and yours\nFix the broken laws and open doors\nWe want in, or let the revolution begin\nWe've been beat before but this time we'll win\nIt's gonna take bravery to stop slavery\nAnd days'll be full of flave and carefree\nIt's different now, the predicament I'm in\nJudge with a grudge just cuz the color of my skin\nRace brutality because of my nationality\nAnd this is what they call reality\nIt's political, hypocritical, uncorrect\nFirst I get lyrical then we come for wreck\nLet's take control, they can't hold us back\nAnd let's attack, with various shades of black\n\nThis part of the revolution is gonna be televised\nYa-know-what-I'm-sayin'\nThis is Rakim Allah\nMy man Easy Moe Bee kept the flow\nYa-know-what-I'm-sayin'\nThe last platoon coming to through your neighborhood ?\nAin't nothin' change but the year\nFor '95 so c'mon"}}, {"title": "I'm Back",

R-A-K-I-M\nCome through in a by, lean low like I'm doin a crime\nEmpty ya nines and bend in the dime\nThoughts hard to find that's why I got 'em losin they mind\nI'm bettin rhymes, til the end of times\nShame on some, can't wait til the fame is done\nYou can curse if you pray for the day to come\nStay with the gun, stay in the slum, stay number 1\nTo the day the earth drift away from the sun\nI meditate and let the ancient spirits speak through the pen\nSo every word I display a true or a gem, or holdin the grim\nStill shootin two in ya men\nIf you think the world's greatest can't do it again\n\n[Chorus](4x)\nThere's a cold, cold feeling in my heart\n\n[Verse 2: Rakim]\nYo, in the life for thuggin, we like to get high from puffin\nForty-five is bustin, like live percussion\nWill them thighs be bobbin\nThat's why we try to stay alive in hustlin\nBut some of us die for nothing\nTry to clock on the block, that's horn it with boats on it\nWith Ghetto Legends to America's Most Wanted\nLost souls in the crossroads of sidewalk\nLife is soft when you live and die in New York\nYou've been wrong before\nYou'll be missin til your picture's on the wall\nOn the side of a corner store\nEither flowin on tour, or goin to war\nI was born to ball what the fuck is wrong wit y'all\nI wrote the scripture\nMy lyrics just spoken with a flow\nThere's no vision whole hit in the motion picture\nWatchin the style you see +Apocalypse Now+\nAnd you can feel what I feel when I'm rockin the crowd\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3: Rakim]\nFrom beyond the stars, it's the fiend Rah\nWith a God's spoon to bomb my 16 bars\nSo when they aks why you grievin huh\nDoin my shit ain't bizar\nTell 'em you just seen God\nBroads is panick cause Black Jesus is track divas\nAnd packin fiend it's just like heaters, causin panick\nAlthough I'm organic, my rap reaches to where the track\nDevious speakers Ra's off the planet\nFocus and click I'm unseen so you hope it's a glimpse\nFoto reflexes of Total Eclipse\nI put the world in a state of a let-up\nThe way I'm puttin in work\nYo, stay out the way or get hurt\nAs I mastercrash that allow me to stash the cash\nThis is the shit, they don't have to blast\nSo grab your glass, and your grass, and your hash\nCause this is just the beginning of the Aftermath\n\n[Chorus]\nNo doubt\nWord\nThug Baby\nNew York City", "image":

(Raahaaaah)\nUhh, Ayatollah (allowed it)\nFrom the song (Raaah)\n\n[Verse 1: Rakim]\nLet the games begin, it's nothing but pain for them\nI - don't - play - I - win\nI got plain again that's why I came again\nIt's the R-A-K-I-M\nCome through in a by, lean low like I'm doin a crime\nEmpty ya nines and bend in the dime\nThoughts hard to find that's why I got 'em losin they mind\nI'm bettin rhymes, til the end of times\nShame on some, can't wait til the fame is done\nYou can curse if you pray for the day to come\nStay with the gun, stay in the slum, stay number 1\nTo the day the earth drift away from the sun\nI meditate and let the ancient spirits speak through the pen\nSo every word I display a true or a gem, or holdin the grim\nStill shootin two in ya men\nIf you think the world's greatest can't do it again\n\n[Chorus](4x)\nThere's a cold, cold feeling in my heart\n\n[Verse 2: Rakim]\nYo, in the life for thuggin, we like to get high from puffin\nForty-five is bustin, like live percussion\nWill them thighs be bobbin\nThat's why we try to stay alive in hustlin\nBut some of us die for nothing\nTry to clock on the block, that's horn it with boats on it\nWith Ghetto Legends to America's Most Wanted\nLost souls in the crossroads of sidewalk\nLife is soft when you live and die in New York\nYou've been wrong before\nYou'll be missin til your picture's on the wall\nOn the side of a corner store\nEither flowin on tour, or goin to war\nI was born to ball what the fuck is wrong wit y'all\nI wrote the scripture\nMy lyrics just spoken with a flow\nThere's no vision whole hit in the motion picture\nWatchin the style you see +Apocalypse Now+\nAnd you can feel what I feel when I'm rockin the crowd\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3: Rakim]\nFrom beyond the stars, it's the fiend Rah\nWith a God's spoon to bomb my 16 bars\nSo when they aks why you grievin huh\nDoin my shit ain't bizar\nTell 'em you just seen God\nBroads is panick cause Black Jesus is track divas\nAnd packin fiend it's just like heaters, causin panick\nAlthough I'm organic, my rap reaches to where the track\nDevious speakers Ra's off the planet\nFocus and click I'm unseen so you hope it's a glimpse\nFoto reflexes of Total Eclipse\nI put the world in a state of a let-up\nThe way I'm puttin in work\nYo, stay out the way or get hurt\nAs I mastercrash that allow me to stash the cash\nThis is the shit, they don't have to blast\nSo grab your glass, and your grass, and your hash\nCause this is just the beginning of the Aftermath\n\n[Chorus]\nNo doubt\nWord\nThug Baby\nNew York City"}},

bright\nI was on the mic, man we got it on last night\nBut today my pockets are tight\nGotta find a way to get my money right\nI'm jumping on my bike\nIn flight, scheming on everything in sight\nUptight, and then that kid cut me off at the light\nNow I'm in a fight, but not quite\nThe kid ran up and he got bust with all my might\nI got to find away, slide, find a hideaway\nChange my overlay, now everything's A-OK\nI watch the cops roll, kid is still knocked out cold\nI'm on the phone\nOh yeah, I got my man on hold\nA-yo meet me at the favorite spot at 1 o'clock\nCall the crew, tell 'em to meet us on the block\nTimes is hard and I got laid off\nThe streets is the last resorts to get paid off\n\nNeed some money...money\nNeed some moolah, y'all...moolah, y'all\n\n(Verse 2)\nI'm at the top of the afternoon\nIt's 'bout to be on soon\nHere come the last platoon\nWe monopolize unstoppable plots arise\nThe element of surprise, intelligent men on a rise\nFirst we use a universal greeting\nThen I get straight to the reason for the meeting\nStats are low, habits are slow\nThe welcome mat says go\nAnd we can make stacks of dough\nBut it's back to the last resort\nI got paid on\nA kid, we had beef in the street to make it short\nHe swung and he missed\nI trapped his fists and locked him\nAnd then I snatched his watch off his wrist and dropped him\nHere I am with

Cee-lo game you ever seen going on\nThe minimum is 100 dollars to bowl\nIf your hands our cold we're taking side bets on the roll\nAnd if you're interested something smooth like chess\nTry to stress

get my money right\nI'm jumping on my bike\nIn flight, scheming on everything in sight\nUptight, and then that kid cut me off at the light\nNow I'm in a fight, but not quite\nThe kid ran up and he got bust with all my might\nI got to find away, slide, find a hideaway\nChange my overlay, now everything's A-OK\nI watch the cops roll, kid is still knocked out cold\nI'm on the phone\nOh yeah, I got my man on hold\nA-yo meet me at the favorite spot at 1 o'clock\nCall the crew, tell 'em to meet us on the block\nTimes is hard and I got laid off\nThe streets is the last resorts to get paid off\n\nNeed some money...money\nNeed some moolah, y'all...moolah, y'all\n\n(Verse 2)\nI'm at the top of the afternoon\nIt's 'bout to be on soon\nHere come the last platoon\nWe monopolize unstoppable plots arise\nThe element of surprise, intelligent men on a rise\nFirst we use a universal greeting\nThen I get straight to the reason for the meeting\nStats are low, habits are slow\nThe welcome mat says go\nAnd we can make stacks of dough\nBut it's back to the last resort\nI got paid on\nA kid, we had beef in the street to make it short\nHe swung and he missed\nI trapped his fists and locked him\nAnd then I snatched his watch off his wrist and dropped him\nHere I am with another money making scam\nWe sell the Rolex and it's to the next plan\nWe got laid off but I can flip the money I made off\nThe streets is the last resorts to get paid off\n\nNeed some money...money\nNeed some moolah, y'all...moolah, y'all\n\n(Verse 3)\nThis is how it's going down\nA holiday called Hustler's Day spread the word around town\nThis affair should be held once every year\nWe could come out to play and the coast is clear\nWe got the ball tournaments 500 a man\nWhen you win it's a grand and let your dough expand\nBut if that takes too long\nWe got the biggest Cee-lo game you ever seen going on\nThe minimum is 100 dollars to bowl\nIf your hands our cold we're taking side bets on the roll\nAnd if you're interested something smooth like chess\nTry to stress the best and seize all progress\nMany events to earn plenty ?\nFor the finale, DJs and rappers represent\nAnd count all the money you made off the day\nAnd come forth to your last resort to get paid off\n\nNeed some money...money\nNeed some moolah, y'all...moolah, y'all"}}, {"title": "Feelin' You", "album": null, "year": "2000-01-01", "lyrics": "[Verse : Rakim]\nFirst it was off and on\nWe kinda lost the bond\n'Cause I was always gone\nBut I'm a cautious Don\nI check the pros and cons\nAnd made the forces strong\nWe grew close and fond\nNow it's soft and warm\nThe way we kiss and hug\nMake me miss your love\nAnd if this is love\nI won't forget your love\nI'll make you miss this thug\nLike a mystic drug\nYou the distant love\nI'm reminiscing of\nHow it used to be\nHow will the future be\nWhat you do to me\nBaby you for me\nYou gettin' used to me\nYou gettin' loose for me\nYou seducing me\nIt's exclusively\nWe cannot regret\nHow I got you wet\nYou cannot forget\nBaby, not just yet\nI caress with finesse\nTill it's lots of sweat\nYou High Tech\nPlus you hot to death\nI'm feelin' you\n\n[Chorus: ?]\nYou know I don't care how much cash you got\nOr how many times you like to blast your Glock\nYour benz, your ice, or your master spot\nOr the flow is fast or not [?]\nI like it when you rise to the top like an astronaut\nTouch me all over you don't have to stop\nUntil you put my body into aftershock\nIt's hot, baby that's the spot\n(I'm feelin' you)\n\n[Verse 2: Rakim]\nWe've been through ups and downs\nWith this love we found\nWe've been around and round\nWell, baby trust me now\nNo fuss allowed\nAnd plus we vowed\nThat it must be now\nReach out and touch me now\nYo, you smooth with yours\nThe way you move with yours\nYour cool with yours\nIt's like \"Ohh\" with yours\nYou ooze across\nEven your shadow soothe the floors\nWhen your gone, your perfume stay glued to walls\nYou got the softest lips\nYou're proportionate\nIt's always more to grip\nYou's a gorgeous chick\nYo, I'm enforcing it\nYou keep the torches lit\nAnd when I'm flossin' it\nIt's some exhausting shit\nSo, here's looking at you\nAbout to attack you\nI tickle your back, boo\nLook at your tattoo\nYou make me do what I have to do to attract you\nBut, that's you\nYou never act new\nI'm feelin' you\n\n[Chorus: ?]\nYou know I don't care how much cash you got\nOr how many times you like to blast your Glock\nYour benz, your ice, or your master spot\nOr the flow is fast or not [?]\nI like it when you rise to the top like an astronaut\nTouch me all over you don't have to stop\nUntil you put my body into aftershock\nIt's hot, baby that's the spot\n(I'm feelin' you)\n\n[Verse 3: Rakim]\nWe on the up and up\nRut em' up for what\nIt's like our love is up\nNo more fuckin' up\nIt don't mean nothin' but\nUs clutchin' up\nUntil we love to lust\nI wanna touch you up\nNo more trials and trips\nYour smile's a gift\nYour styles swiss\nYou used to get wild and flip\nWhen I was around the clique\nYou toned it down a bit\nIt don't quit\nEh yo, no more childish shit\nYou get my all and all\nIf we fall we fall\nMaybe it's all because love ain't got no flaws\nBut, I'm sure you'll adore\nWhat the future stores\nI'll make your juices pour\nI want more and more\nAnd if this is the spot\nThat always gets you hot\n'Course if it's not\nI'll push it up a notch\nAnd hit a different spot\nUntil you hit the top\nAnd ah yeah, baby this is hot\nI'm feelin' you\n\n[Chorus: ?]\nYou know I don't care how much cash you got\nOr how many times you like to blast your Glock\nYour benz, your ice, or your master spot\nOr the flow is fast or not [?]\nI like it when you rise to the top like an

gone\nBut I'm a cautious Don\nI check the pros and cons\nAnd made the forces strong\nWe grew close and fond\nNow it's soft and warm\nThe way we kiss and hug\nMake me miss your love\nAnd if this is love\nI won't forget your love\nI'll make you miss this thug\nLike a mystic drug\nYou the distant love\nI'm reminiscing of\nHow it used to be\nHow will the future be\nWhat you do to me\nBaby you for me\nYou gettin' used to me\nYou gettin' loose for me\nYou seducing me\nIt's exclusively\nWe cannot regret\nHow I got you wet\nYou cannot forget\nBaby, not just yet\nI caress with finesse\nTill it's lots of sweat\nYou High Tech\nPlus you hot to death\nI'm feelin' you\n\n[Chorus: ?]\nYou know I don't care how much cash you got\nOr how many times you like to blast your Glock\nYour benz, your ice, or your master spot\nOr the flow is fast or not [?]\nI like it when you rise to the top like an astronaut\nTouch me all over you don't have to stop\nUntil you put my body into aftershock\nIt's hot, baby that's the spot\n(I'm feelin' you)\n\n[Verse 2: Rakim]\nWe've been through ups and downs\nWith this love we found\nWe've been around and round\nWell, baby trust me now\nNo fuss allowed\nAnd plus we vowed\nThat it must be now\nReach out and touch me now\nYo, you smooth with yours\nThe way you move with yours\nYour cool with yours\nIt's like \"Ohh\" with yours\nYou ooze across\nEven your shadow soothe the floors\nWhen your gone, your perfume stay glued to walls\nYou got the softest lips\nYou're proportionate\nIt's always more to grip\nYou's a gorgeous chick\nYo, I'm enforcing it\nYou keep the torches lit\nAnd when I'm flossin' it\nIt's some exhausting shit\nSo, here's looking at you\nAbout to attack you\nI tickle your back, boo\nLook at your tattoo\nYou make me do what I have to do to attract you\nBut, that's you\nYou never act new\nI'm feelin' you\n\n[Chorus: ?]\nYou know I don't care how much cash you got\nOr how many times you like to blast your Glock\nYour benz, your ice, or your master spot\nOr the flow is fast or not [?]\nI like it when you rise to the top like an astronaut\nTouch me all over you don't have to stop\nUntil you put my body into aftershock\nIt's hot, baby that's the spot\n(I'm feelin' you)\n\n[Verse 3: Rakim]\nWe on the up and up\nRut em' up for what\nIt's like our love is up\nNo more fuckin' up\nIt don't mean nothin' but\nUs clutchin' up\nUntil we love to lust\nI wanna touch you up\nNo more trials and trips\nYour smile's a gift\nYour styles swiss\nYou used to get wild and flip\nWhen I was around the clique\nYou toned it down a bit\nIt don't quit\nEh yo, no more childish shit\nYou get my all and all\nIf we fall we fall\nMaybe it's all because love ain't got no flaws\nBut, I'm sure you'll adore\nWhat the future stores\nI'll make your juices pour\nI want more and more\nAnd if this is the spot\nThat always gets you hot\n'Course if it's not\nI'll push it up a notch\nAnd hit a different spot\nUntil you hit the top\nAnd ah yeah, baby this is hot\nI'm feelin' you\n\n[Chorus: ?]\nYou know I don't care how much cash you got\nOr how many times you like to blast your Glock\nYour benz, your ice, or your master spot\nOr the flow is fast or not [?]\nI like it when you rise to the top like an astronaut\nTouch me all over you don't have to stop\nUntil you put my body into aftershock (yeah, baby)\nIt's hot, baby that's the spot\n(I'm feelin' you)"}}, {"title": "L.i. interlude", "album": "The Master", "year": "1999-11-30", "lyrics": "(instrumental)", "image":

it?\nXeroxed, zero, no match, a ditto\nA copy machine couldn't reprint my little\nFast [?] joy, case you're unsure\nBut my [?] has you thinkin' either or\nBut I'll always let you now what the outcome will be\nSo you can understand where I come from see\nMCs interfere but they can't school me\nI've seen your work G, it don't fool me\n\nI said you don't fool me\n\nBut you don't fool me\n\nI said you can't fool me\n\nPeople always say, what they wanna do\nThings they gotta do, but never get it done\nSome front all the props about how many girls they got\nBut when it all boils down they get none\nYeah I know all they really gotta do is get a life\nNo future in frontin' I hope you see the light\nInstead of trying to flip, you need to get a grip\nWake up and stop tryin' to sell dreams all night\nSlow down and make sense, before you get paid\nOr take up a new trade cuz it ain't' cool G\nYou say you're all that when you ain't half of that\nGive me my ear back cause you don't fool me\n\nI

came up with something wicked, dig it\nYou hear it in the crib and get evicted when I kick it\nThey'll make a duplicate of it and tell 'em how I flip it\nIs it another masterpiece or is it?\nXeroxed, zero, no match, a ditto\nA copy machine couldn't reprint my little\nFast [?] joy, case you're unsure\nBut my [?] has you thinkin' either or\nBut I'll always let you now what the outcome will be\nSo you can understand where I come from see\nMCs interfere but they can't school me\nI've seen your work G, it don't fool me\n\nI said you don't fool me\n\nBut you don't fool me\n\nI said you can't fool me\n\nPeople always say, what they wanna do\nThings they gotta do, but never get it done\nSome front all the props about how many girls they got\nBut when it all boils down they get none\nYeah I know all they really gotta do is get a life\nNo future in frontin' I hope you see the light\nInstead of trying to flip, you need to get a grip\nWake up and stop tryin' to sell dreams all night\nSlow down and make sense, before you get paid\nOr take up a new trade cuz it ain't' cool G\nYou say you're all that when you ain't half of that\nGive me my ear back cause you don't fool me\n\nI said you don't

Saturday mornin' I'm off from work\nLater on tonight, it's the time for the mic expert\nYeah, but I won't lose my shirt\nSince I'm smooth I play it cool like Herc\nI go to the park and play some ball\nI ain't that tall but I bet I can slay 'em all\nBall handle like a Louie Vuitton suitcase\nBut I lost the ball when I saw a cute face\nCause girlies me rollin' around 11 o'clock\nI'm on the court hot not missing the shots\nShe sat on the bench by the fence, it was time to move\nLooking intense, but everything's cool\n\nShe was watching every move that I made\nAnd I seen a smile every time I got paid\nThen I had a thought what was she doin' later on\nWent down court, turned around she was gone\nI still had a memory of her physical chemistry\nIf I saw her again I'm sure she'll remember me\nPlayed til it was dark and went back to the apartment\nThey quit cuz they know I'm the last brother to start with\nJumped in the car then I'm gone\nTo chill at the rest til the party later on\nIn the cassette deck was Kid Capri\nDrove up the block and what did the kid see?\nGirl from the park, well she eyeballin' me\nTurned the base down was she callin' me?\nProvoked to the
