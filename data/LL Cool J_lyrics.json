Uh, yeah\n(oooooooh!) Uptown, you know how we do it\nYeah you know\nMake it hot\n\n[Verse 1: LL Cool J & LeShaun]\nIt's the first time together and I'm feeling kinda horny\nConventional methods of makin' love kinda bore me\nI wanna knock your block off, get my rocks off\nBlow your socks off make sure your G spots soft\nI'ma call you Big Daddy and scream your name\nMatter fact I can't wait for your candy rain\nSo whatcha sayin'? I get my swerve on, bring it live\nMake it last forever, damn the kitty cat's tight\nMmm... daddy slow down your flow\nPut it on me like G baby nice and slow\nI need a rough neck nigga, Mandingo in the sack\nWho ain't afraid to pull my hair and spank me from the back\nNo doubt, I'm the playa that you're talkin' about\nBut do you really think that you can work it out?\nI guarantee shorty it's real, baby stick it out\nHere comes the man of steel\n\n[Chorus: LeShaun & LL Cool J]\nDoing it and doing it and doing it well\nDoing it and doing it and doing it well\nDoing it and doing it and doing it well\nI represent Queens, she was raised out in Brooklyn\nDoing it and doing it and doing it well\nDoing it and doing it and doing it well\nDoing it and doing it and doing it well\nI represent Queens, she was raised out in Brooklyn\n\n[Verse 2: LL Cool J & LeShaun]\nI'm in the mix now, searching for the right spot\nTo hit now, get down\nDamn I love a dick down, you use a rubber?\nDamn right\nYou are my lover\nAll night\nThe putty good to you? Word to momma\nMad tight\nThe only thing left to do is climax\nLet's make it last\nWord we ain't goin' out like that\nAll this time you've been telling that you was a Don\nI tried to warn you, girl, you wouldn't listen\nNow let's get it on\nMmm, baby wild, don't do that\nChill wait a minute baby let me please you back\nYou talk a good one shorty now you're makin' me sweat\nHow a live nigga like it girl?\nNice and wet\nWe get it on To The Break of Dawn, damn you're large\nHow a big girl like it Daddy?\nNice and hard\nSafe sexin' it, flexin' it, gettin' that affectionate\nChewin' it, oohin'

it bounce sugar\nLong as you can bounce me back\nMore flesh than the Greek Fest\nRoll up the sess\nPass the Hennessy\nPut my body to the test\nWait wait daddy many niggas ago\nI was a young girl listening to how you flow\nNow's my chance to hit you off daddy I'm grown\nFrom the back, from the side\nRight, I'm in the zone\nOne of a kind when it's time to do mine\nCamcorder and the whole shit\nPress rewind\nLet it flow on the screen while we puffs the L\nLayin back in the cut while we're under the spell\nWord life, I like the way the ep went down\nGo to sleep, tomorrow I'll take you back downtown\nWe'll be\n\n[Chorus: LeShaun & LL Cool J]\nDoing it and doing it and doing it well\nDoing it and doing it and doing it well\nDoing it and doing it and doing it well\nI represent Queens,

1]\nDon't call it a comeback, I been here for years\nRocking my peers and putting suckas in fear\nMaking the tears rain down like a monsoon\nListen to the bass go boom\nExplosion, overpowering\nOver the competition, I'm towering\nWrecking shop, when I drop\nThese lyrics that'll make you call the cops\nDon't you dare stare, you better move\nDon't ever compare\nMe to the rest that'll all get sliced and diced\nCompetition's paying the price\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)\nMama said knock you out (Huuh!)\nI'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)\nMama said knock you out (Huuh!)\nI'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)\nMama said knock you out (Huuh!)\nI'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)\nMama said knock you out (Huuh!)\n\n[Verse 2]\nDon't you call this a regular jam\nI'm gonna rock this land\nI'm gonna take this itty bitty world by storm\nAnd I'm just getting warm\nJust like Muhummad Ali they called him Cassius\nWatch me bash this beat like a skull\n'Cause you know I had beef wit\nWhy do you riff with me, the maniac psycho\nAnd when I pull out my jammy get ready 'cause it might go\nBLAAAAW, how ya like me now?\nThe ripper will not allow\nYou to get with, Mr. Smith, don't riff\nListen to my gear shift\nI'm blasting, outlasting\nKinda like Shaft, so you could say I'm shafting\nOlde English filled my mind\nAnd I came up with a funky rhyme\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm gonna knock you out

new tour\nI'm going insane, starting the hurricane, releasing pain\nLetting you know that you can't gain, I maintain\nUnless ya say my name\nRipping, killing\nDigging and drilling a hole\nPass the Ol' Gold\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)\nMama said knock you out (Huuh!)\nI'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)\nMama said knock you out (Huuh!)\nI'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)\nMama said knock you out (Huuh!)\nI'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)\nMama said knock you out (Huuh!)\n\n[Verse 4]\nShotgun blasts are heard\nWhen I rip and kill, at will\nThe man of the hour, tower of power, I'll devour\nI'm gonna tie you up and let you understand\nThat I'm not your average man\nWhen I got a jammy in my hand\nDAAAAAM!!!!! Oooooohh!!\nListen to the way I slaaaaay, your crew\nDamage UHH, damage UHH, damage UHH, damage\nDestruction, terror, and mayhem\nPass me a sissy so suckas I'll slay him\nFarmers (What?!) Farmers (What?!)\nI'm ready (We're ready!!)\nI think I'm gonna bomb a town (Get down!!)\nDon't you never, ever, pull my lever\n'Cause I explode\nAnd my nine is easy to load\nI gotta thank God\n'Cause he gave me the strength to rock, HARD!\nKnock you out, mama said knock you out\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)\nMama said knock you out (Huuh!)\nI'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)\nMama said

"lyrics": "[Intro]\nC'mon, man\n\n[Interlude]\nAnd with the local DBT news, LL Cool J with a triumphant comeback\nBut tonight\n\n[Verse 1]\nDon't call it a comeback, I been here for years\nRocking my peers and putting suckas in fear\nMaking the tears rain down like a monsoon\nListen to the bass go boom\nExplosion, overpowering\nOver the competition, I'm towering\nWrecking shop, when I drop\nThese lyrics that'll make you call the cops\nDon't you dare stare, you better move\nDon't ever compare\nMe to the rest that'll all get sliced and diced\nCompetition's paying the price\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)\nMama said knock you out (Huuh!)\nI'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)\nMama said knock you out (Huuh!)\nI'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)\nMama said knock you out (Huuh!)\nI'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)\nMama said knock you out (Huuh!)\n\n[Verse 2]\nDon't you call this a regular jam\nI'm gonna rock this land\nI'm gonna take this itty bitty world by storm\nAnd I'm just getting warm\nJust like Muhummad Ali they called him Cassius\nWatch me bash this beat like a skull\n'Cause you know I had beef wit\nWhy do you riff with me, the maniac psycho\nAnd when I pull out my jammy get ready 'cause it might go\nBLAAAAW, how ya like me now?\nThe ripper will not allow\nYou to get with, Mr. Smith, don't riff\nListen to my gear shift\nI'm blasting, outlasting\nKinda like Shaft, so you could say I'm shafting\nOlde English filled my mind\nAnd I came up with a funky rhyme\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)\nMama said knock you out (Huuh!)\nI'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)\nMama said knock you out (Huuh!)\nI'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)\nMama said knock you out (Huuh!)\nI'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)\nMama said knock you out (Huuh!)\nBreakdown!\n\n[Verse 3]\nUh, Shadow boxing when I heard you on the radio HUUUH!!!\nI just don't know\nWhat made you forget that I was raw?\nBut now I got a new tour\nI'm going insane, starting the hurricane, releasing pain\nLetting you know that you can't gain, I maintain\nUnless ya say my name\nRipping, killing\nDigging and drilling a hole\nPass the Ol' Gold\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)\nMama said knock you out (Huuh!)\nI'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)\nMama said knock you out (Huuh!)\nI'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)\nMama said knock you out (Huuh!)\nI'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)\nMama said knock you out (Huuh!)\n\n[Verse 4]\nShotgun blasts are heard\nWhen I rip and kill, at will\nThe man of the hour, tower of power, I'll devour\nI'm gonna tie you up and let you understand\nThat I'm not your average man\nWhen I got a jammy in my hand\nDAAAAAM!!!!! Oooooohh!!\nListen to the way I slaaaaay, your crew\nDamage UHH, damage UHH, damage UHH, damage\nDestruction, terror, and mayhem\nPass me a sissy so suckas I'll slay him\nFarmers (What?!) Farmers (What?!)\nI'm ready (We're ready!!)\nI think I'm gonna bomb a town (Get down!!)\nDon't you never, ever, pull my lever\n'Cause I explode\nAnd my nine is easy to load\nI gotta thank God\n'Cause he gave me the strength to rock, HARD!\nKnock you out, mama said knock you out\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)\nMama said knock you out (Huuh!)\nI'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)\nMama said knock you out (Huuh!)\nI'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)\nMama said knock you out (Huuh!)"}}, {"title": "Around the Way Girl", "album": "Mama Said Knock You Out", "year": "1990-11-20", "lyrics": "[Intro: Sample]\nYou got me shook up, shook down, shook out\nOn your loving, your loving\n\n[Verse 1]\nI want a girl with extensions in her hair\nBamboo earrings, at least two pair\nA Fendi bag and a bad attitude\nThat's all I need to get me in a good mood\nShe can walk with a switch and talk with street slang\nI love it when a woman ain't scared to do her thing\nStanding at the bus stop sucking on a lollipop\nOnce she gets pumping its hard to make the hottie stop\nShe likes to dance to the rap jams\nShe sweet as brown sugar with the candied yams\nHoney coated complexion, using Camay\nLet's hear it for the girl, she's from around the way\n\n[Chorus]\nI need an around the way, girl\nAround the way, girl\nThat's the one for me\nShe's the only one for me\nI need an around the way, girl\nYou got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving\n\n[Verse 2]\nSilky, milky, her smile is like sunshine\nThat's why I had to dedicate at least one rhyme\nTo all the cuties in the neighborhood\n'Cause if I didn't tell you then another brother would\nYou're sweet like sugar with your gangster talk\nWant to eat you like a cookie when I see you walk\nWith your rayon, silk or maybe even denim\nIt really doesn't matter as long as you're in 'em\nYou can break hearts and manipulate minds\nOr surrender act tender be gentle and kind\nYou always know what to say and do\nCold flip when you think your man is playing you\nNot cheap or petty, you're ready for loving\nYou're real independent so your parents be bugging\nBut if you ever need a place to stay\nCome around my way\n\n[Chorus]\nI need an around the way, girl\nAround the way, girl\nThat's the one for me\nShe's the only one for me (to the bridge)\nI need an around the way, girl\nYou got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving\n\n[Verse 3]\nPerm in your hair or even a curly weave\nWitcha New Edition Bobby Brown button on your sleeve\nI tell you come here, you say meet me half way\n'Cause brother's been popping that game all day\nAround the way you're like a neighborhood jewel\nAll the homeboys sweat you so you're crazy cool\nWear your gold in the summer with your biking shorts\nWhile you watching all the brothers on the basketball court\nGoing to the movies with your homegirl's crew\nWhile the businessmen in suits be hawking you\nBaby hair pumping, lip gloss is shining\nI think you in the mood for wining and dining\nSo we can go out and eat somewhere\nWe got a lot of private jokes to share\nLisa, Angela, Pamela, Renee\nI love you, you're from around the way\n\n[Chorus]\nI need an around the way, girl\nAround the way, girl\nThat's the one for me\nShe's the only one for me\nI need an around the way, girl\nYou got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving\nI need an around the way, girl\nAround the way, girl\nThat's the one for me\nShe's the only one for me\nI need an around the way, girl\nI'm asking you\n\n[Outro]\nYou got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving\nYou got me shook up, shook down\nYou got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving\nYou got me shook up, shook down\nYou got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving\nYou got me shook up, shook down\nYou got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving\nYou got me shook up, shook down", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0994b089dccd891aa21c8d45ddae0fef.500x500x1.jpg", "artist": "LL Cool J", "raw": {"annotation_count": 21, "api_path": "/songs/29036", "apple_music_id": "50328", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/29036/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "\u201cAround The Way Girl\u201d is a smooth jam written as \u201can ode to the girl next door\u201d \u2013 the girls LL would see on a daily basis while riding around in his neighborhood.\n\nReleased as the album\u2019s second single, it became LL\u2019s first top 10 hit in the US, selling 500,000 copies before the end of 1991.

loving\n\n[Verse 1]\nI want a girl with extensions in her hair\nBamboo earrings, at least two pair\nA Fendi bag and a bad attitude\nThat's all I need to get me in a good mood\nShe can walk with a switch and talk with street slang\nI love it when a woman ain't scared to do her thing\nStanding at the bus stop sucking on a lollipop\nOnce she gets pumping its hard to make the hottie stop\nShe likes to dance to the rap jams\nShe sweet as brown sugar with the candied yams\nHoney coated complexion, using Camay\nLet's hear it for the girl, she's from around the way\n\n[Chorus]\nI need an around the way, girl\nAround the way, girl\nThat's the one for me\nShe's the only one for me\nI need an around the way, girl\nYou got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving\n\n[Verse 2]\nSilky, milky, her smile is like sunshine\nThat's why I had to dedicate at least one rhyme\nTo all the cuties in the neighborhood\n'Cause if I didn't tell you then another brother would\nYou're sweet like sugar with your gangster talk\nWant to eat you like a cookie when I see you walk\nWith your rayon, silk or maybe even denim\nIt really doesn't matter as long as you're in 'em\nYou can break hearts and manipulate minds\nOr surrender act tender be gentle and kind\nYou always know what to say and do\nCold flip when you think your man is playing you\nNot cheap or petty, you're ready for loving\nYou're real independent so your parents be bugging\nBut if you ever need a place to stay\nCome around my way\n\n[Chorus]\nI need an around the way, girl\nAround the way, girl\nThat's the one for me\nShe's the only one for me (to the bridge)\nI need an around the way, girl\nYou got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving\n\n[Verse 3]\nPerm in your hair or even a curly weave\nWitcha New Edition Bobby Brown button on your sleeve\nI tell you come here, you say meet me half way\n'Cause brother's been popping that game all day\nAround the way you're like a neighborhood jewel\nAll the homeboys sweat you so you're crazy cool\nWear your gold in the summer with your biking shorts\nWhile you watching all the brothers on the basketball court\nGoing to the movies with your homegirl's crew\nWhile the businessmen in suits be hawking you\nBaby hair pumping, lip gloss is shining\nI think you in the mood for wining and dining\nSo we can go out and eat somewhere\nWe got a lot of private jokes to share\nLisa, Angela, Pamela, Renee\nI love you, you're from around the way\n\n[Chorus]\nI need an around the way, girl\nAround the way, girl\nThat's the one for me\nShe's the only one for me\nI need an around the way, girl\nYou got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving\nI need an around the way, girl\nAround the way, girl\nThat's the one for me\nShe's the only one for me\nI need an around the way, girl\nI'm asking you\n\n[Outro]\nYou got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving\nYou got me shook up, shook down\nYou got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving\nYou got me shook up, shook down\nYou got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving\nYou got me shook up, shook down\nYou got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving\nYou got me shook up, shook down"}}, {"title": "I Shot Ya (Remix)", "album": "Mr. Smith", "year": "1995-11-21", "lyrics": "[Produced by Trackmasters]\n\n[Intro: Keith Murray]\nHa!\nYeah, L.O.D\nKeith Murray, Def Squad\nMister, mister, mister, Mister Smith\nYou want a hit?\nGive me a hour plus a pen and a pad\n\n[Verse 1: Keith Murray]\nI'm here to make a dollar out of fifteen cents\nAnd let my balls hang like I'm on a toilet taking a shit\nMy style is all that and a big bag of chips with the dip\nFuck all that sensuous shit\nI represent intellectual violence\nAnd leave your clique holier than the Ten Commandments\nLike Redman, I shift with the ruck\nIf your if was a spliff, we'd be all fucked up (Word up)\nNo need to ask you who is he, son I get busy\nScuff my Timbs on the boulevard on many rough cities\n(Chicago, LA, any of 'em) I'll have to Norman Bate you\nI love ta hate you cause you's a freak by nature\nCan't wait to face ya, mutilate ya\nDrink your style down straight with no chaser\nMy verbal combat's like a mini-Mac to your back\nAs soon as one of you niggas try to over react\nThe L.O.D. love good confrontation or vamp\nBreak your concentration, murder your camp\nFor the jealous, overzealous, we fellas\nBlow the the spot like Branford Marsalis\nNiggas coming through and acting wild\nY'all commercial niggas better have a coke and a smile\nI shot ya!\n\n[Verse 2: Prodigy]\nI conversate with many men, it's time to begin again\nForgot what I already knew, ayo, you hear me friend?\nIlluminati want my mind, soul and my body\nSecret society, trying to keep they eye on me\nBut I'ma stay incogni', in places they can't find me\nMake my moves strategically, the G.O.D\nIt's sorta similar but iller than a chess player\nI use my thinker, it coincides with my blinker\nWhile you wondered what we saying on the records real\nYeah, you mothafuckin' right kid you know the deal\nMy Mobb is Infamous just like the fuckin' title read\nYou get back slapped so hard, make ya nose bleed\nSome def kids feeling guilty 'bout the space shit\nThe truth hurts baby girl so just face it (alright)\nBut anyway, back on the real side of things\nMy niggas sling cracks and wear fat diamond rings\nNot only is it inside the songs that we sing\nEverything is real not just a song that we sing\nFrom my life to the paper, very accurately\nGive you all of my two so maybe you can three\nProdigy will forever will S-H-I-N-E\nMy shit attract millions like the moon attract the sea\nHow dare you ever in your life walk past me\nWithout acknowledging this man as G-O-D\nI shot you faggot ass\n\n[Verse 3: Fat Joe]\nNow who the fuck you think you talking to\nI pay dues, I spray crews\nLook, I'm Joey Crack, motherfuckers be like, \"He's bad news\"\nRunnin this racket, from New York to Montego\nSlaughtering people, bring a ton of keys from Puerto Rico\nI'd rather be feared than loved because the fear lasts longer\nThese bitch-ass niggas know we stronger\nThan these weaklings, seeking for respect that ain't there\nKnuckleheads beware, there's mad tension in the air\nTommy guns for fun, shotties for block parties\nWhile fresh lead heats up your insides like a fifth of Bacardi\nCall the ambulette, this man's wet\nBullets cut him down from the root up just like a Gillette\nRazor, which I keep hidden in my oral\nReady to spatter at any ad out that wants to quarrel\nThese feds want me for some tax evasion\nMad at the fact that somebody's getting lucci that's not Caucasian\nBullets be blazing through these streets filled with torture\nJoey Crack a.k.a. Keyser S\u00f6ze\n\n[Verse 4: Foxy Brown]\nThug niggas give they minks to chinks, tore down\nWe sip drinks, rockin' minks, flashin' rings and things\nFrontin' hardcore deep inside the Jeep, mackin'\nDoin' my thing, fly nigga, you a Scarface king\nBitches grab ya ta-ta's, get them niggas for they cheddar\nFuck it, Gucci sweaters and Armani leathers\nFlossin' rocks like the size of Fort Knox\nFour carats, the ice rocks, pussy bangin' like Versace locs pops\nWant ta the creep, on the light raw ass cheeks\nI'm sexin' raw dog without protection, disease infested, uh!\nItaliano got the Lucciano\nI gets down, fuckin' with Brown Fox, extra keys to the drop\nBoo, I'm jingling, baby\nI got crazy Dominicans who pay me to lay low, I play slow\nRoll with The Firm, Mafioso crime kingpin\nIt all real nigga, what the deal? I shot ya\n\n[Verse 5: LL Cool J]\nWhat the fuck, I thought I conquered the world?\nCrushed Moe Dee, Hammer, and Ice-T's girl\nBut still, niggas want to instigate shit\nI'll battle any nigga in the rap game quick\nName the spot, I make it hot for you bitches\nFemale rappers too, I don't give a fuck, boo\nWord, I'm here to crush all my peers\nRhymes of the month in The Source for twenty years\nNiggas scared, I'm detrimental to your mental state\nI use my presidential Rolex to be the bait\nNiggas fight, Glock cocked, ya temple gets fucked\nMCs that fuck with LL, they gets bucked\nThat's real, what's up with that I Shot Ya deal?\nLight shit, niggas slip, now how the bullet feel?\nNew York appeal, in L.A. they gang bang\nBut if you touch a mic, your motherfuckin ass hang\nThat's facts, niggas don't receive no type of slack\nCause if they do, they ass is always runnin' back\nNot this time, but next time, I'ma name names\nLL, shitting from on top of the game\nI shot ya!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/aba57f7703e47dacfcd5243398922d01.500x500x1.jpg", "artist": "LL Cool J", "raw": {"annotation_count": 44, "api_path": "/songs/29059", "apple_music_id": "1036934209", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/29059/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "Produced by the Trackmasters, the remix of LL Cool J\u2019s \u201cI Shot Ya\u201d is a posse cut that features then-up and coming New York MC\u2019s Prodigy of Mobb Deep, Fat Joe, the debuting Foxy Brown, and Keith Murray, who was previously featured in the original version of \u201cI Shot Ya,\u201d spitting the track\u2019s hook inspired by a line from LL\u2019s hit single \u201cI\u2019m Bad\u201d.\n\nThis remix is notable due to the appearances of Prodigy and Keith Murray rhyming back to back on the same track in the middle of their beef.

"lyrics": "[Produced by Trackmasters]\n\n[Intro: Keith Murray]\nHa!\nYeah, L.O.D\nKeith Murray, Def Squad\nMister, mister, mister, Mister Smith\nYou want a hit?\nGive me a hour plus a pen and a pad\n\n[Verse 1: Keith Murray]\nI'm here to make a dollar out of fifteen cents\nAnd let my balls hang like I'm on a toilet taking a shit\nMy style is all that and a big bag of chips with the dip\nFuck all that sensuous shit\nI represent intellectual violence\nAnd leave your clique holier than the Ten Commandments\nLike Redman, I shift with the ruck\nIf your if was a spliff, we'd be all fucked up (Word up)\nNo need to ask you who is he, son I get busy\nScuff my Timbs on the boulevard on many rough cities\n(Chicago, LA, any of 'em) I'll have to Norman Bate you\nI love ta hate you cause you's a freak by nature\nCan't wait to face ya, mutilate ya\nDrink your style down straight with no chaser\nMy verbal combat's like a mini-Mac to your back\nAs soon as one of you niggas try to over react\nThe L.O.D. love good confrontation or vamp\nBreak your concentration, murder your camp\nFor the jealous, overzealous, we fellas\nBlow the the spot like Branford Marsalis\nNiggas coming through and acting wild\nY'all commercial niggas better have a coke and a smile\nI shot ya!\n\n[Verse 2: Prodigy]\nI conversate with many men, it's time to begin again\nForgot what I already knew, ayo, you hear me friend?\nIlluminati want my mind, soul and my body\nSecret society, trying to keep they eye on me\nBut I'ma stay incogni', in places they can't find me\nMake my moves strategically, the G.O.D\nIt's sorta similar but iller than a chess player\nI use my thinker, it coincides with my blinker\nWhile you wondered what we saying on the records real\nYeah, you mothafuckin' right kid you know the deal\nMy Mobb is Infamous just like the fuckin' title read\nYou get back slapped so hard, make ya nose bleed\nSome def kids feeling guilty 'bout the space shit\nThe truth hurts baby girl so just face it (alright)\nBut anyway, back on the real side of things\nMy niggas sling cracks and wear fat diamond rings\nNot only is it inside the songs that we sing\nEverything is real not just a song that we sing\nFrom my life to the paper, very accurately\nGive you all of my two so maybe you can three\nProdigy will forever will S-H-I-N-E\nMy shit attract millions like the moon attract the sea\nHow dare you ever in your life walk past me\nWithout acknowledging this man as G-O-D\nI shot you faggot ass\n\n[Verse 3: Fat Joe]\nNow who the fuck you think you talking to\nI pay dues, I spray crews\nLook, I'm Joey Crack, motherfuckers be like, \"He's bad news\"\nRunnin this racket, from New York to Montego\nSlaughtering people, bring a ton of keys from Puerto Rico\nI'd rather be feared than loved because the fear lasts longer\nThese bitch-ass niggas know we stronger\nThan these weaklings, seeking for respect that ain't there\nKnuckleheads beware, there's mad tension in the air\nTommy guns for fun, shotties for block parties\nWhile fresh lead heats up your insides like a fifth of Bacardi\nCall the ambulette, this man's wet\nBullets cut him down from the root up just like a Gillette\nRazor, which I keep hidden in my oral\nReady to spatter at any ad out that wants to quarrel\nThese feds want me for some tax evasion\nMad at the fact that somebody's getting lucci that's not

You're neither here or there\nI swear I can't find you anywhere\nDamn sure you ain't in my closet, or under my rug\nThis love search is really making me bug\nAnd if you know who you are why don't you make yourself seen?\nTake the chance with my love and you'll find out what I mean\nFantasies can run, but they can't hide\nAnd when I find you I'm gon' pour all my love inside\n\n[Hook]\nI need love\nI need love\n\n[Verse 3]\nI wanna kiss you, hold you, never scold, you just love you\nSuck on you neck, caress you and rub you\nGrind, moan and never be alone\nIf you're not standing next to me you're on the phone\nCan't you hear it in my voice?

mind I hear my conscience call\nTelling me I need a girl who's as sweet as a dove\nFor the first time in my life, I see I need love\nThere I was giggling about the games\nThat I had played with many hearts, and I'm not saying no names\nThen the thought occured, tear drops made my eyes burn\nAs I said to myself, \"look what you've done to her\"\nI can feel it inside, I can't explain how it feels\nAll I know is that I'll never dish another raw deal\nPlaying make-believe pretending that I'm true\nHolding in my laugh as I say that I love you\nSaying amor kissing you on the ear\nWhispering, \"I love you and I'll always be here\"\nAlthough I often reminsce I can't believe that I found\nA desire for true love floating around\nInside my soul because my soul is cold\nOne half of me deserves to be this way till I'm old\nBut the other half needs affection and joy\nAnd the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy\n\n[Hook]\nI need love\nI need love\n\n[Verse 2]\nRomance, sheer delight, how sweet?\nI gotta find me a girl to make my life complete\nYou can scratch my back, we'll get cozy and huddle\nI'll lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle\nI'll give you a rose, pull out your chair before we eat\nKiss you on the cheek and say, \"ooh girl, you're so sweet\"\nIt's deja vu whenever I'm with you\nI could go on forever telling you what I do\nBut where you at? You're neither here or there\nI swear I can't find you anywhere\nDamn sure you ain't in my closet, or under my rug\nThis love search is really making me bug\nAnd if you know who you are why don't you make yourself seen?\nTake the chance with my love and you'll find out what I mean\nFantasies can run, but they can't hide\nAnd when I find you I'm gon' pour all my love inside\n\n[Hook]\nI need love\nI need love\n\n[Verse 3]\nI wanna kiss you, hold you, never scold, you just love you\nSuck on you neck, caress you and rub you\nGrind, moan and never be alone\nIf you're not standing next to me you're on the phone\nCan't you hear it in my voice? I need love bad\nI've got money, but love's something I've never had\nI need your ruby red lips sweet face and all\nI love you more than a man who's 10 feet tall\nI'd watch the sunrise in your eyes\nWe're so in love when we hug we become paralyzed\nOur bodies explode in ecstasy unreal\nYou're as soft as a pillow and I'm as hard as steel\nIt's like a dream land, I can't lie, I never been there\nMaybe this is an experience that me and you can share\nClean and unsoiled yet sweaty and wet\nI swear to you this is something I'll never forget\n\n[Hook]\nI need love\nI need love\n\n[Verse 4]\nSee what I mean? I've changed, I'm no longer\nA playboy on the run, I need something that's stronger\nFriendship, trust, honor, respect, admiration\nThis whole experience has been such a revelation\nIt's taught me love and how to be a real man\nTo always be considerate and do all I can\nProtect you, you're my lady and you mean so much\nMy body tingles all over from the slightest touch\nOf your hand and understand I'll be frozen in time\nTill we meet face to face and you tell me you're mine\nIf I find you, girl, I swear I'll be a good man\nI'm not gonna leave it in destiny's hands\nI can't sit and wait for my princess to arrive\nI gotta struggle and fight to keep my dream alive\nI'll search the whole world for that special girl\nWhen I finally find you watch our love unfurl\n\n[Hook]\nI need love\nI need love\n\n[Outro]\nGirl, listen to me. When I be sitting in my room all alone, staring at the wall\nFantasies, they go through my mind, and I've come to realize that I need true love\nAnd if you wanna give it to me, girl, make yourself seen. I'll be waiting\nI love you"}}, {"title": "4, 3, 2, 1", "album": "Phenomenon", "year": "1997-12-09", "lyrics": "[Intro: LL Cool J & Redman]\nMake it butter\nI'm gonna Bankhead bounce\nNo doubt\nAyo, watch your mouth\n\n[Chorus 1: LL Cool J & Redman]\nAyo, one two three four five six seven, blaze the hot\nTrizack that sound like heaven\nSeven six five four three two one\nC'mon, Meth-Tical, come and get some\n\n[Verse 1: Method Man]\nPlaying my position, hot Nick, son\nThis one, for all the sick ones, infliction\nPoisonous darts sickening, best believe\nFinger itchin' with two broke legs, now I'm trippin'\nOn MC's cliche, shot that ricochets\nStart trouble bust bubbles, hip to wicked ways\nGotta love me, G-O-D, no one above me\nLook good but fuck ugly\nTap your jaw from my Punch Buggy sonning you\nGot you shittin' in your last Huggie, running who\nFuckin' punk, get a speed bump coming through\nA single shot make yo meat lump, respect Wu\n\n[Verse 2: Redman]\nAyo, I put it on a nigga, shitted on a nigga\nTurn a Christian to a certified sinner\nThe bomb I release, time pent up (Explode)\nWhen you got sent up I was hitting your ex ho\nShit, I kept low, petro' your metro\nPolitic, keep the chickenheads gobblin'\nShit I'm driving in come with funk halogen\nTerrorize your city, from the spliff committee\nKick ass 'til both Timberlands turn shitty\nGritty, smack the driver's head in the gypsy\nWhen I approach rappers be taking notes\nI drop like I shoulda invented the raincoat\nAbsolute, I love to burn to the roots\nI keep comin' 'til your pour sperm from your boots\nVigilante hardcore to the penis\nTell you \"Fuck you,\" my attitude is anaemic\n\n[Verse 3: Canibus]\nI'm the illest nigga alive, watch me prove it\nI snatch your crown with ya head still attached to it\nCanibus is the type who'll fight for mics\nBeating niggas to death and beating dead niggas to life\nWhen you look at me long enough, I start to read your thoughts\nIf the signal was strong enough, and then I'll call your bluff\nLike, \"Yo, how many rhymes you got?\"\nI think I'll go on for more Milleniums than Mazda's got on the car lot\nAnd there's nowhere to run to, when I confront ya\nNigga, I call your bluff like it had a phone number\nWho wanna see Canibus get wild?\nWho wanna act fly and get shot down with a surface-to-air missile?\nI take em on in all shapes, sizes, and forms, and spit on\nAnybody who ain't close enough to shit on\nZero to sixty?

LL also disses Canibus in the song, that prompted Canibus to record \u201c2nd Round K.O.\u201d.\n\nIt features a sample of LL\u2019s own \u201cRock the Bells\u201d\nand the Beastie Boys' \u201c(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)\u201d.\n\nThe video version not only does not include Canibus on the video but it cuts Canibus' verse altogether.

Man, Redman, Canibus, Master P and DMX from Cool J\u2019s seventh album, Phenomenon. It was released on December 9, 1997 for Def Jam Recordings and was produced by LL Cool J and Erick Sermon.\n\nThis song is most notable for starting the LL and Canibus beef because a line Canibus says, \u201cL, is that a mic on your arm, lemme borrow that.\u201d LL found this offensive and had him change the line. LL also disses Canibus in the song, that prompted Canibus to record \u201c2nd Round K.O.\u201d.\n\nIt features a sample of LL\u2019s own \u201cRock the Bells\u201d\nand the Beastie Boys' \u201c(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)\u201d.\n\nThe video version not only does not include Canibus on the video but it cuts Canibus' verse altogether. This version of the song includes Canibus' verse."}, "comment_count": 0, "community": true, "custom_preview": null, "has_voters": true, "id": 3495133, "pinned": false, "share_url":

watch your mouth\n\n[Chorus 1: LL Cool J & Redman]\nAyo, one two three four five six seven, blaze the hot\nTrizack that sound like heaven\nSeven six five four three two one\nC'mon, Meth-Tical, come and get some\n\n[Verse 1: Method Man]\nPlaying my position, hot Nick, son\nThis one, for all the sick ones, infliction\nPoisonous darts sickening, best believe\nFinger itchin' with two broke legs, now I'm trippin'\nOn MC's cliche, shot that ricochets\nStart trouble bust bubbles, hip to wicked ways\nGotta love me, G-O-D, no one above me\nLook good but fuck ugly\nTap your jaw from my Punch Buggy sonning you\nGot you shittin' in your last Huggie, running who\nFuckin' punk, get a speed bump coming through\nA single shot make yo meat lump, respect Wu\n\n[Verse 2: Redman]\nAyo, I put it on a nigga, shitted on a nigga\nTurn a Christian to a certified sinner\nThe bomb I release, time pent up (Explode)\nWhen you got sent up I was hitting your ex ho\nShit, I kept low, petro' your metro\nPolitic, keep the chickenheads gobblin'\nShit I'm driving in come with funk halogen\nTerrorize your city, from the spliff committee\nKick ass 'til both Timberlands turn shitty\nGritty, smack the driver's head in the gypsy\nWhen I approach rappers be taking notes\nI drop like I shoulda invented the raincoat\nAbsolute, I love to burn to the roots\nI keep comin' 'til your pour sperm from your boots\nVigilante hardcore to the penis\nTell you \"Fuck you,\" my attitude is anaemic\n\n[Verse 3: Canibus]\nI'm the illest nigga alive, watch me prove it\nI snatch your crown with ya head still attached to it\nCanibus is the type who'll fight for mics\nBeating niggas to death and beating dead niggas to life\nWhen you look at me long enough, I start to read your thoughts\nIf the signal was strong enough, and then I'll call your bluff\nLike, \"Yo, how many rhymes you got?\"\nI think I'll go on for more Milleniums than Mazda's got on the car lot\nAnd there's nowhere to run to, when I confront ya\nNigga, I call your bluff like it had a phone number\nWho wanna see Canibus get wild?\nWho wanna act fly and get shot down with a surface-to-air missile?\nI take em on in all shapes, sizes, and forms, and spit on\nAnybody who ain't close enough to shit on\nZero to sixty? I'm already doin' a hundred when I'm blunted\nAnd I give it to any nigga that want it\n\n[Verse 4: DMX]\nStay out the dark, cause if I catch you when the sun is down\nRun it clown, come up off that, or I'm gon' gun it down\nWhen in doubt, however skull goes, it's gon' be that\nSee that, that shit'll finish you, dog, believe that\nWhere we at, do you value your life, as much as your possessions\nDon't be a stupid nigga, learn a lesson\nI'm gon' get you either way, and it's better to live\nLet me get what's between your sock, cause it's, better to give\nThan receive, believe what I say when I tell you\nDon't make me put you somewhere where nobody'll smell you\nAnd when the lights is out, they don't come back on\nThis ain't a flick you ain't gon' come back on\nYou ain't that strong\nYou knew it was wrong, but you asked for it baby\nYou'se a pink nigga, ski mask for it baby\nSo I can hit you up on Front Street, you think I'm sweet\nWant heat, one deep, leave him behind, front seat\n\n[Chorus 2: Redman]\nAyo, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven\nBlaze the hot trizack, shine like heaven\nSeven, six, five, four, three, two, one\nCome on Mr. Smith, come get some\n\n[Verse 5: LL Cool J]\nWhen young sons fantasize of borrowing flows\nTell little shorty with the big mouth the bank is closed\nThe symbol on my arm is off limits to challengers\nYou hold the rusty swords, I swing the Excalibur\nHow dare you step up in my dimension\nYour little ass should be somewhere cryin on detention\nWatch your mouth better yet hold your tongue\nI'ma do this shit for free this time this one's for fun\nBlow you to pieces, leave you covered in feces\nWith one thesis (\"LL Cool J is hard\")\nEvery little boy wanna pick up the mic\nAnd try to run with the big boys and live up to the real hype\nBut that's like picking up a ball, playing with Mike\nSwingin at Ken Griffey or challenging Roy to a fight\nSnapping, you amateur MC's\nDon't you know I'm like the Dream Team touring overseas\nFor rappers in my circle I'm a deadly disease\nRingmaster, bringing a tiger cub to his knees\nIn the history of rap they've never seen such prominence\nYour naive confidence gets crushed by my dominance\nNow let's get back to this mic on my arm\nIf it ever left my side it'd transform into a time bomb\nYou don't wanna borrow that, you wanna idolize\nAnd you don't wanna make me mad nigga you wanna socialize\nAnd I'm daring every MC in the game\nTo play yourself out position, and mention my name\nI make a rhyme for every syllable in your name\nGo platinum for every time your grimy ass was on the train\nWatch your mouth don't ever step out of line\nLL Cool J nigga, greatest of all time"}}, {"title": "I'm Bad", "album": "Bigger and Deffer", "year": "1987-06-13", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nCalling all cars, calling all cars...\nBe on the lookout for a tall light-skinned brother with dimples\nWearing a black Kangol, sweatsuit, gold chain, and sneakers.\nLast seen on Farmers Boulevard headed east.\nAlias L.L.

He's bad...\n\n[Verse 1]\nAaaahhhhhhhhhh\nNo rapper can rap quite like I can\nI'll take a musclebound man and put his face in the sand\nNot the last Mafioso I'm a MC cop\nMake you say \"Go LL,\" and do the wop\nIf you think you can outrhyme me, yeah boy I bet\nCause I ain't met a motherfucker who can do that yet\nTrendsetter I'm better my rhymes are good\nI got a gold nameplate that says I wish you would\nAnd when rappers begin then I gotta join in and\nBefore my rhyme is over, you know I'mma win\nCool J has arrived so you better make way\nAsk anybody in the crowd they say the kid don't play\nSlaughter competition, that's my hobby and job\nI don't wear a disguise because I don't owe the mob\nGot a pinpoint rap that makes you feel trapped\nSo many girls on my jock, I think my phone is tapped\nI'm bad\n\nCool J, Cool J, Cool J, Cool J, Cool J, Cool J\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm like Tyson, icin' I'm a soldier at war\nI'm makin' sure you don't try to battle me no more\nGot concrete rhymes, been rappin' for ten years and\nEven when I'm bragging, I'm bein' sincere!\nEmcees can't win I make 'em rust like tin\nThey call me 'Jaws,' my hat is like a shark's fin\nBecause I'm bad as can be, got my voice on wax\nSome brothers think he's making records now he must have relaxed\nI couldn't, I shouldn't, and it'll stay that way\nThe best rapper you've heard is LL Cool J\nKamikaze take a look at what I've done\nUsed to rock in my basement now I'm number one\nAnd can happen on time, never standin' on line\nYou wanna try me? First you better learn how to rhyme\nI'm the pinnacle; that means I reign supreme\nAnd I'm notorious; I'll crush you like a jellybean!\nI'm bad\n\n[?]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI eliminate punks, cut 'em up in chunks\nYou were souped, you heard me, and your ego shrunk\nI'm devastating I'm so good it's a shame\nCause I eat rappers like a cannibal they call me insane\nI'm as strong as a bull of course you know why I pull\nI enjoy what I'm doing plus I'm paid in full\nNot Buckaroo Banzai, but bustin' out as I\nSay the kind of rhymes that make MC's with that I'd die\nNever retire or put my mic on the shelf\nThe baddest rapper in the history of rap itself\nNot bitter or mad, just provin' I'm bad\nYou want a hit? Give me a hour plus a pen and a pad!\nMC's retreat, cause they know I can beat 'em\nAnd eat 'em in a battle and the ref won't cheat 'em\nI'm the baddest! Takin' out all rookies\nSo forget Oreos, eat Cool J cookies, I'm bad!\n\nCool J, Cool J,Cool J,Cool J, Cool J,Cool J\n\n[Verse 4]\nNever ever no never\nNever wearin' no Levis, battle me why try?\nI'll treat you like a stepchild so tell mommy \"bye bye\"\nSlaughterin' MC's and I'mma never get whipped\nWhen I retire I'll get worshipped like a old battleship\nLL I'm bad, all the rappers know\nWhen I enter the center they say, 'Yo, yo there he go!'\nMy paycheck's large Mr. Bogart in charge\nNot a puncher or hunter from a raccoon lodge\nThe original Todd, teachin' how to be hard\nTake the skin off a snake, and split a pea from a pod\nYou're a novice I'm noble and I decipher my tongue\nNot Attila the Hun, nor Abdullah his son\nMy vocals exact, like rack and pinion in a Jag\nYou try to brag, you get your rhymes from a grab-bag\nNo good scavenger, catfish vulture\nMy tongue's a chisel and this composition's sculpture, I'm bad!\n\n[Outro]\n(Think I'm gonna need backup)\n(Think I'm gonna need backup)\n\nGimme that walkie-talkie!\nYo this is LL Cool J\nAnd you'll never catch me so don't even try it\nCause I'm too bad for ya, understand?!\nAaaaaahhhh... I'm bad!"}}, {"title": "Hey Lover", "album": "Mr. Smith", "year": "1995-10-31", "lyrics": "[Intro: Michael McCary]\nI've been watchin' you from afar\nFor as long as I can remember\nYou're all a real man can need\nAnd ever ask for\nThis is love, girl\nThis is more than a crush\nYeah\n\n[Verse 1: LL Cool J]\nIt was Harlem at the Ruckers, I saw with your man\nSmilin', huh, a Coach bag in your hand\nI was layin' in the coupe with my hat turned back\nWe caught eyes for a moment, and that was that\nSo skated off, as you strolled off\nLookin' at them legs, god damn they looked so soft (So fine)\nI gotta take ya from your man that's my mission\nIf his love is real he got ta handle competition\nYou only knew him five months (That's right)\nBesides he drink too much and smoke too many blunts\nAnd I be workin' out everyday thinkin' bout you\nLooking at my own eyes in the rear view\nCathchin flash backs of our eye contact\nWish I could lay ya on your stomach and caress your back\nI would hold ya in my arms and ease your fears\nI can't believe it, I hadn't had a crush in years\nHey lover\n\n[Chorus: Boyz II Men]\nHey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\nHey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\nLover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\nHey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\n\n[Verse 2: LL Cool J]\nI see you at the bus stop waitin' everyday\nYour man must think its safe for you to travel that way\nBut I don't want ta violate your relationship\nSo I lay back in the cut with a crush that's a trip\nStill he can't stop me from having daydreams\nTonguin' you down with, uh, vanilla ice cream\nKissing on your thighs in the moonlight\nSearchin' your body with my tongue, girl, all night\nI wonder one day could it be, simple dreams turnin' into reality\nOur love would come down so naturally\nWe would walk down the aisle of destiny\nWhat your man got his hustle on gotcha type scared\nBreak ya off a little chump change to do your hair\nThat seems to be enough to satisfy your needs\nBut there's a deeper level if you just follow my lead\nHey lover\n\n[Chorus: Boyz II Men]\nHey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\nHey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\nLover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\nHey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\n\n[Verse 3: LL Cool J]\nLast week I saw ya at the mall\nStandin' at the pay phone 'bout to make a call\nI had a vision it was me on the other end\nTellin' you come by and then you walked in\nI touched you gently with my hands\nWe talked about travelin' the distant lands\nEscapin' all the madness out here in the world\nBecomin' my wife, no longer my girl\nThen, you let your dress fall down to the floor\nI kissed you softly and you yearned for more\nWe experienced pleasure unparallel\nInto an ocean of love we both fell\nSwimmin' in the timeless, currents of pure bliss\nFantasies interchangin' with each kiss\nUndyin' passion unities our souls\nTogether we swim until the point of no control, but\nIt's a fantasy it (that, you) won't come true\nWe never even spoke and your man swear he love you\nSo I'm a keep all these feelin's inside\nKeep my dreams alive until the right time\n\n[Chorus: Boyz II Men]\nHey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\nHey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\nLover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\nHey lover, hey lover, this is more than...\nHey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\nHey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\nLover, hey lover, baby this is more

remember\nYou're all a real man can need\nAnd ever ask for\nThis is love, girl\nThis is more than a crush\nYeah\n\n[Verse 1: LL Cool J]\nIt was Harlem at the Ruckers, I saw with your man\nSmilin', huh, a Coach bag in your hand\nI was layin' in the coupe with my hat turned back\nWe caught eyes for a moment, and that was that\nSo skated off, as you strolled off\nLookin' at them legs, god damn they looked so soft (So fine)\nI gotta take ya from your man that's my mission\nIf his love is real he got ta handle competition\nYou only knew him five months (That's right)\nBesides he drink too much and smoke too many blunts\nAnd I be workin' out everyday thinkin' bout you\nLooking at my own eyes in the rear view\nCathchin flash backs of our eye contact\nWish I could lay ya on your stomach and caress your back\nI would hold ya in my arms and ease your fears\nI can't believe it, I hadn't had a crush in years\nHey lover\n\n[Chorus: Boyz II Men]\nHey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\nHey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\nLover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\nHey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\n\n[Verse 2: LL Cool J]\nI see you at the bus stop waitin' everyday\nYour man must think its safe for you to travel that way\nBut I don't want ta violate your relationship\nSo I lay back in the cut with a crush that's a trip\nStill he can't stop me from having daydreams\nTonguin' you down with, uh, vanilla ice cream\nKissing on your thighs in the moonlight\nSearchin' your body with my tongue, girl, all night\nI wonder one day could it be, simple dreams turnin' into reality\nOur love would come down so naturally\nWe would walk down the aisle of destiny\nWhat your man got his hustle on gotcha type scared\nBreak ya off a little chump change to do your hair\nThat seems to be enough to satisfy your needs\nBut there's a deeper level if you just follow my lead\nHey lover\n\n[Chorus: Boyz II Men]\nHey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\nHey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\nLover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\nHey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\n\n[Verse 3: LL Cool J]\nLast week I saw ya at the mall\nStandin' at the pay phone 'bout to make a call\nI had a vision it was me on the other end\nTellin' you come by and then you walked in\nI touched you gently with my hands\nWe talked about travelin' the distant lands\nEscapin' all the madness out here in the world\nBecomin' my wife, no longer my girl\nThen, you let your dress fall down to the floor\nI kissed you softly and you yearned for more\nWe experienced pleasure unparallel\nInto an ocean of love we both fell\nSwimmin' in the timeless, currents of pure bliss\nFantasies interchangin' with each kiss\nUndyin' passion unities our souls\nTogether we swim until the point of no control, but\nIt's a fantasy it (that, you) won't come true\nWe never even spoke and your man swear he love you\nSo I'm a keep all these feelin's inside\nKeep my dreams alive until the right time\n\n[Chorus: Boyz II Men]\nHey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\nHey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\nLover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\nHey lover, hey lover, this is more than...\nHey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\nHey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\nLover, hey lover, baby this is more than a crush\nHey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush"}}, {"title": "Luv U Better", "album": "10", "year": "2002-09-13", "lyrics": "[Intro: Pharrell Williams]\nThis is for my number one\nThis

for my number one\nThis is for my number one\nTrue baby for I adore\n\n[Verse 1: LL Cool J]\nThis is hard to say\nI wanna make sure I go about this in the right way\nCuz lately I been busy a lot\nAnd I know you don\u2019t feel appreciated and what not\nI used to tell you that you\u2019re hair looked fly\nKiss you slow and stare in your eyes\nNow I talk real foul and slick\nEvery other sentence is, \u201cYou make me sick\u201d\nBack in the days I was your number one pick\nNow your heart\u2019s half-broken and that\u2019s hard to fix\nI had to dig deep inside myself\nCuz I can\u2019t see you bouncin\u2019 with somebody else\nIt\u2019s a long journey back to the place we was\nWhen I was too embarrassed to admit I was in love\nAnd you was my good girl that wouldn\u2019t give it up\nI can\u2019t let us self-destruct\n\n[Chorus: Marc Dorsey]\nBaby smile today\nCuz I been imaginin\u2019 more ways\nI\u2019m gon\u2019 luv U better\nWhen your friends\u2019ll see you too\nJust when you think there\u2019s nothin\u2019 else I can do\nI\u2019m gon\u2019 luv U better\n\n[Verse 2: LL Cool J]\nWhen I think about the things we did\nAnd I think about you having my kids\nAnd I think about us sharing a crib\nLosin\u2019 all that, God forbid\nYou deserve flowers and candy, the simple things\nIn addition to the SL\u2019s, baguettes and rings\nInstead I walk around like I\u2019m a king\nAnd

Philpot\nHe'll never skip it, only rip it when he's on the fader\nWhat's my d.j.'s name, Cut Creator\nNow you know, at the show, who\u2019s on the wheels\nHe'll drive the cross fader like a cut mobile\nSo precise with a slice that you know he's greater\nWhat's my d.j.'s name, Cut Creator\nNow you know, what do you know, Earl roles the weed\nI go to the store and get Old Gold\nSo all you crabby lookin' nappy headed girls get back\nCause there's a ten to one chance that you might get smacked\nRock the bells\n\nThe bells are circulatin' the blood in your veins\nWhy are girlies on the tip, L.L.'s your name\nCut Creator's (good), Cool J. is (good-good)\nYou bring the wood pecker, I'll bring the wood\nThe bells are wippin' and rippin' at your body and soul\nWhy do you like Cool J., we like rock and roll\nCause it ain't the glory days with Bruce Springsteen\nI'm not a virgin so I know I'll make Madonna scream\nYou hated Michael and Prince all the way, ever since\nIf their beats were made of meat, then they would have to be mince\nRock the bells\n\nSo listen to the lines of rhyme, I rhyme on time\nHe'll cut the record in a second, make your d.j. look blind\nSo all you Jheri Curl suckers wearin' high-heel boots\nLike ballerinas, what I mean is you're a fruit-loop troop\nAll you gonna-be(s), wanna-be(s), when will you learn\nWanna be like Cool J., you gotta wait your turn\nSome suckers don't like me, but I'm not concerned\nSix-g (s) for twenty minutes is the pay I earn\nI'm growin' and glowin' like a forest blaze\nDo you like Michael Jackson? \"We like Cool J\"\nThat's right, I'm on the mic with the help of the bells\nThere's no delayin' what I'm sayin' as I'm rockin' you well\nRock the bells"}}, {"title": "Going Back to Cali", "album": "Walking with a Panther", "year": "1988-01-27", "lyrics": "[Hook]\nI'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali\nI'm going back to Cali... hmm, I don't think so\nI'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali\nI'm going back to Cali...

(I do what I gotta do)\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo what you got the cash flow in escrow, damn\nBut your honey ran away like presto, ala-kazam\nMan made the money, money never made the man\nYou still fakin' jacks throwin' rocks on her hand\nSee, you put your mack down, now you Nino Brown\nRock roller with so much ice your cap's polar\nI got her smokin' beedies, modeling bikinis\nPushin' your whip on the Van Wyck to see me\nI keep it steamy, I make it burn when it's my turn\nTeaching shorty all the jewels that you never learned\nDon't get it twisted, getting money ain't wrong\nBut she wanna make love all night long, I'm gone\n\n[Chorus 4X: Total + (LL Cool J)]\nWho do you love? (I wanna lounge with you)\nAre you for sure? (I do what I gotta do)\n\n[Bridge: Total]\nWho do you love? Are you for sure? (You know it's you)\nWho do you love? Are you for sure? (Are you for sure?)\n\n[Outro: Total]\nWho do you love?

My name is L, I'm from Queens\nI heard about your man, he like to lace you with cream\nDolce Gabbana, Moschino with Donna jeans\nBut he slipped up, and threw his rock to a fiend\nHe be playin' like a Willie 'cause he dress ya dove\nNever knowin' that his woman is in need of love\nYou got Versace gold link stomach chains with rocks\nOfficial hair style but you stuck up in the spot\nMakin love, Duke is weak then he fallin asleep\nYou on the phone wit your old peeps dyin' to creep 'tween my sheets\nSo what you got Chanel on your feet\nHot sex on a platter makes the mission complete, uh\n\n[Chorus 4X: Total + (LL Cool J)]\nWho do you love? (I wanna lounge with you)\nAre you for sure? (I do what I gotta do)\n\n[Verse 2]\nJew-els and Cristal got him actin' funny style\nHe ain't watchin' you, he rather watch his money pile\nCan't protect treasures when it's in a glass house\nSoon as he turn the corner I'mma turn that ass out\nFull blown, frontin' in the 6 with the chrome\nYo B, why you leave your honey all alone with me?\nJust because you blessed with cash\nDoesn't mean your honey won't let me finesse that ass\nSo see the moral of the story is a woman need love\nThe kind you so-called players never dreamed of\nYou got to try love, can't buy love\nIf you play your hand, then it's bye-bye love\n\n[Chorus 4X: Total + (LL Cool J)]\nWho do you love? (I wanna lounge with you)\nAre you for sure? (I do what I gotta do)\n\n[Bridge: Total + LL Cool J]\nWho do you love? Are you for sure? (You know it's you)\nWho do you love? Are you for sure? (I do what I gotta do)\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo what you got the cash flow in escrow, damn\nBut your honey ran away like presto, ala-kazam\nMan made the money, money never made the man\nYou still fakin' jacks throwin' rocks on her hand\nSee, you put your mack down, now you Nino Brown\nRock roller with so much ice your cap's polar\nI got her smokin' beedies, modeling bikinis\nPushin' your whip on the Van Wyck to see me\nI keep it steamy, I make it burn when it's my turn\nTeaching shorty all the jewels that you never learned\nDon't get it twisted, getting money ain't wrong\nBut she wanna make love all night long, I'm gone\n\n[Chorus 4X: Total + (LL Cool J)]\nWho do you love? (I wanna lounge with you)\nAre you for sure? (I do what I gotta do)\n\n[Bridge: Total]\nWho do you love? Are you for sure? (You know it's you)\nWho do you love? Are you for sure? (Are you for sure?)\n\n[Outro: Total]\nWho do you love? (Repeat with LL Cool J ad-libs)"}}, {"title": "The Ripper Strikes Back", "album": null, "year": "1998-04-28", "lyrics": "We just gon have some fun with hip hop\nA lil hip hop... relax, hold on to ya seats\nOh yeah this is a Tunnel banger too\nWord up, Tunnel banger baby\nHip-Hop style baby, y'all remember\n\nBy the middle of March, when the pregnancy starts in your ladies' placenta\nThat means L just entered\nDuct taped your little bitch ass for frontin\nYou poor little crackhead ass ain't hurtin nuttin\nNigga you want the fame, now you're famous overnight\nFamous for getting fucked by a stick of dynamite\nYou're weak nigga, you bout to die up in your sleep\nThe overlord of rap will never meet defeat\nPain and agony, I don't touch them zones\nFucking everlasting lyrical methods is my throne\nBlast ya fifty pound ass and make you float\nYou read it shook nigga, I wrote the book, nigga\nHeld down my crown for a decade and a half\nNow I'm bout to give your grimy ass a blood bath\nTalk about bein broke, nigga I'm rich\nCause I learned to separated the money from the bitch\nDon't hate me cause I'm paid, hate me because\nI'm everything you want to be : handsome, young, plus legendary\nTalk about Farrakhan, nigga you got to call Jesse Jackson\nFor some Affirmative Action\n\n[Chorus]\nCan-I-Bus !

bizarre\nEverybody knows\nWhen it come to a situation like this\nLittle more effects\nAnd I can't resist\nSo we get funky in the house\nYouknowmsayin?\nL.L. Cool J style\nWhat?\nThis ain't on a pop tip\nCheck it out\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhat is a panther? A animal that kills\nI'm like a shark with blood comin out the gills\nYou could never in your wildest dreams\nGet a piece of this gangsta lean straight from Queens\nStrong as liquor, to be seen in a limousine\nNow you're gettin done without Vaseline\nWouldn't bite because your rhymes are puppy chow\nMade another million, so competitors bow\nHomeboy, hold on, my rhymes are so strong\nNothing could go wrong, so why do you prolong\nSongs that ain't strong, brother, you're dead wrong\nAnd got the nerve to have them Star Trek shades on\nHa, you can't handle the whole weight\nSkin needs lotion, teeth need Colgate\nWise up, you little burnt up french fry\nI'm that type of guy\nAnd I slammed you know, just like a sumo\nPut him in Pampers, leave my drawers in his hamper\nWhen I'm through, you need a brand-new identity\nI was scoopin girls before you lost your virginity\nYour jam is just a dreamin MC scheme\nGettin crushed by a L.L. theme\nSomethin like Shaft, put you in a cask' - bo!\nYou little blood-clot boy, you must not know\nThe rep I keep, the MC's I peep, sweep, play cheap\nAnd freak with a chic unique technique\nGet rid of the yukmouth smile\nCause brother, you ain't got no style\n\n[Chorus]\nKeep on\n(To da break of dawn)\n(To da break of dawn)\nYeah\nKeep on\n(To da break of dawn)\nHey yo, that's kinda funky\nBut check this out here\n(Rock that shit)\n(To da break of dawn)\nYeah...\n\n[Verse 2 ]\nImmaculate styles I use to abuse\nMC's, so light the fuse\nAnd spread the news, you lose\nTo the damager, microphone manager\nCold crush and bruise and bandage a amateur\nThat amateur swingin a hammer\nFrom a body bag, so run and get your camera\nGet a flick of the stiff dead-shot to get swift\nBut I'm the wrong brother to dance with\nCause I don't need a partner to swing\nKeep your eyes on the Cool J ring\nShootin the gift, but you just don't shoot it right\nYou couldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight\nWouldn't throw a rock in a ghost town\nSo don't try to play post, clown\nYou know the L.L.'s back in town\nAnd all the wanna-be sherrifs is gettin shot down\nGimme that microphone\nI'mma show you the real meaning of the danger zone\nStop dancin, get to walkin\nShut your old mouth when young folks is talkin\nHuh, you little snake in the grass\nYou swing a hammer, but you couldn't break a glass\nGimme a lighter - woof!\nNow you're cut loose\nFrom that jherri curl juice\nCool J is back on the map\nAnd when I see ya, I'mma give you a slap\nThat's right, a little kick for that crap\nCause my old gym teacher ain't supposed to rap\n\n[Chorus]\nKeep on\n(To da break of dawn)\n(To da break of dawn)\nYeah\nKeep on\n(To da break of dawn)\nHey yo, that's kinda funky\nBut check this out here\n(Rock that shit)\n(To da break of dawn)\nYeah...\n\n[Verse 3]\nHow dare you stand beside me\nI'm Cool, I freeze I-c-e\nOn your trail and I'mma cut that pony tail\nYou're disobedient with the wrong ingredients\nBut I'mma drink you down over the rocks\nWhile the freak on your album cover jocks\nYou're gonna hear a real ill paragraph soon\nI took the cover right home to the bathroom\nIn the immortal words of L.L., 'hard as hell'\nYour broad wears it well\nShe's the reason that your record sold a few copies\nBut your rhymes are sloppy\nLike Oscar, and you're bound to get dropped\nAnd stopped, I ain't Murray the cop\nNor am I Felix, but I got a bag of tricks\nMr. Pusherman, gimme a fix\nSo I can show you I'm immune to them romper room tunes\nYou little hip-hop racoon\nI'm not Scarface, but I want more beef\nBefore you rapped you was a downtown car thief\nWorkin in a parking lot\nA brother with a perm deserves to get burned\nSo tell me how you like your coat cream?\nOn a cone, in a bowl, or in a wet dream?\nWith your tv on channel fuzz\nUncle L, that's how much damage he does\nHere's 5 dollars, catch a taxi cab\nTake your rhymes around the corner to the rap rehab\n\n[Chorus]\nKeep on\n(To da break of dawn)\nYeah\n(To da break of dawn)\nI say keep on\n(To da break of dawn)\n\n[Outro]\nJust wanted to funk it up a little bit\nMy man Pete Rock is up in the crib\nYouknowmsayin\nOver here at Marley Marl house\nJust coolin out\nMy man Clash in the house\nSippin on this Bartles & Jaymes premium peach-flavored wine cooler\nLoungin back\nKeep on\nPeace"}}, {"title": "Big Ole Butt", "album": "Walking with a Panther", "year": "1989-06-09", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI was at the mall, sipping on a milkshake\nPlaying the wall, taking a break\nAdmiring the girls with the bamboo earrings\nBaby hair and body's built to swing\nThat's when I seen her, her name was Tina\nGrace and poise kinda like a ballerina\nI said how you doing, my name's Big L\nDon't ask me how I'm living, cause yo, I'm living swell\nBut then again I'm living kind of foul\nCause my girl don't know that I'm out on the prowl\nTo make a long story short, I got the digits\nCalled her on my car phone and paid her a visit\nI was spanking her and thanking her, chewin' her and doin' her\nLaughin' because my girl didn\u2019t know that I was screwin' her\nLaying like a king on sheets of satin\nThat's what time it is, you know what's happening\nShe had a big ole booty, I was doing my duty\nI mean yo, I admit that my girl's a cutie\nBut Tina was erotic, Earl's my witness\nWith the kind of legs that put stockings out of business\nWhen I went home, I kissed my girl on the cheek\nBut in the back of my mind it was this big butt freak\nI sat my girl down, I couldn't hold it in\nAnd said to her with a devilish grin\n\n[Hook]\nTina got a big ole butt, I know I told you I'd be true\nBut Tina got a big ole butt, so I'm leaving you\nTina got a big ole butt, I know I told you I'd be true\nBut Tina got a big ole butt, so I'm leaving you\n\n[Verse 2]\nI went to the high school about three o'clock\nTo try to catch a cutie riding my jock\nMy homeboy's jeep, the system blasting\nCold forty dogs, smiling and laughing\nGirls all over, the kind I adore\nI felt like a kid in a candy store\nThat's when I seen her, her name was Brenda\nShe had the kind of booty that I'd always remember\nI said to my man, stop the jeep\nShe's only seventeen but yo don't sleep\nI kicked the bass like an NFL punter\nAnd scoped the booty like a big game hunter\nI said to the girl, yo, you look tired\nLet's go get some rest, relax by the fire\nI put the big booty on a bearskin rug\nShe gave me a kiss, I gave her a hug\nI said to the girl, them young boys ain't nothing\nYou want to get freaky, let me kiss your belly button\nI circled it and teased it and made her squeal\nGrabbed a pack of bullets and pulled out the steel\nWhen I was through, I wiped the sweat from my eyes\nWhen to the kitchen and got some sweet potato pies\nTina busted in my house while I was eating\nYou know what I said\nToo bad you caught me cheating but\n\n[Hook]\nBrenda got a big ole butt, I know I told you I'd be true\nBut Brenda got a big ole butt, so I'm leaving you\nBrenda got a big ole butt, I know I told you I'd be true\nBut Brenda got a big ole butt, so I'm leaving you\n\n[Verse 3]\nI went to Red Lobster for shrimp and steak\nAround the time when the waitresses are on their lunch break\nI pulled in the parking lot and parked my car\nSomebody shouted out, I don't care who you are\nI paid it no attention, I walked inside\nBecause Brian had a nine and he was chilling in the ride\nI walked in the place, everybody was looking\nAnd shrimp and steak wasn't the only thing cooking\nI sat down to eat, ordered my food\nI said to the waitress, I don't men to be rude\nBut I'll take you on a platter\nShe said you got a girl, I said it don't matter\nYou look like you're tastier than a piping hot pizza\nWhat's your name, she said my tag says Lisa\nI said, O.K., you're smart and all that\nBut when you get off work, yo, I'll be back\nShe looked at me and said make yourself clear\nL where we going, I said right here\nShe looked kind of puzzled, I said you'll see\nI pulled up at ten on the D-O-T\nWhen she walked out the door, I threw my tongue down her throat\nPushed her back inside and pulled off her coat\nLaid her on the table and placed my order\nAnd gave her a tip much bigger than a quarter\nOn and on to the break'a dawn\nAll over the restaurant, word is bond\nI heard somebody coughing, I checked my watch\nI couldn't believe it said nine o'clock\nI grabbed my pants, put on my Kangol\nWho did I see, oh yo it was Brenda\nYo she worked at Red Lobster but I didn't remember\n\n[Hook]\nLisa got a big ole butt, I know I told you I'd be true\nBut Lisa got a big ole butt, so I'm leaving you - see ya\nLisa got a big ole butt, I know I told you I'd be true\nBut Lisa got a big ole butt, so I'm

break\nAdmiring the girls with the bamboo earrings\nBaby hair and body's built to swing\nThat's when I seen her, her name was Tina\nGrace and poise kinda like a ballerina\nI said how you doing, my name's Big L\nDon't ask me how I'm living, cause yo, I'm living swell\nBut then again I'm living kind of foul\nCause my girl don't know that I'm out on the prowl\nTo make a long story short, I got the digits\nCalled her on my car phone and paid her a visit\nI was spanking her and thanking her, chewin' her and doin' her\nLaughin' because my girl didn\u2019t know that I was screwin' her\nLaying like a king on sheets of satin\nThat's what time it is, you know what's happening\nShe had a big ole booty, I was doing my duty\nI mean yo, I admit that my girl's a cutie\nBut Tina was erotic, Earl's my witness\nWith the kind of legs that put stockings out of business\nWhen I went home, I kissed my girl on the cheek\nBut in the back of my mind it was this big butt freak\nI sat my girl down, I couldn't hold it in\nAnd said to her with a devilish grin\n\n[Hook]\nTina got a big ole butt, I know I told you I'd be true\nBut Tina got a big ole butt, so I'm leaving you\nTina got a big ole butt, I know I told you I'd be true\nBut Tina got a big ole butt, so I'm leaving you\n\n[Verse 2]\nI went to the high school about three o'clock\nTo try to catch a cutie riding my jock\nMy homeboy's jeep, the system blasting\nCold forty dogs, smiling and laughing\nGirls all over, the kind I adore\nI felt like a kid in a candy store\nThat's when I seen her, her name was Brenda\nShe had the kind of booty that I'd always remember\nI said to my man, stop the jeep\nShe's only seventeen but yo don't sleep\nI kicked the bass like an NFL punter\nAnd scoped the booty like a big game hunter\nI said to the girl, yo, you look tired\nLet's go get some rest, relax by the fire\nI put the big booty on a bearskin rug\nShe gave me a kiss, I gave her a hug\nI said to the girl, them young boys ain't nothing\nYou want to get freaky, let me kiss your belly button\nI circled it and teased it and made her squeal\nGrabbed a pack of bullets and pulled out the steel\nWhen I was through, I wiped the sweat from my eyes\nWhen to the kitchen and got some sweet potato pies\nTina busted in my house while I was eating\nYou know what I said\nToo bad you caught me cheating but\n\n[Hook]\nBrenda got a big ole butt, I know I told you I'd be true\nBut Brenda got a big ole butt, so I'm leaving you\nBrenda got a big ole butt, I know I told you I'd be true\nBut Brenda got a big ole butt, so I'm leaving you\n\n[Verse 3]\nI went to Red Lobster for shrimp and steak\nAround the time when the waitresses are on their lunch break\nI pulled in the parking lot and parked my car\nSomebody shouted out, I don't care who you are\nI paid it no attention, I walked inside\nBecause Brian had a nine and he was chilling in the ride\nI walked in the place, everybody was looking\nAnd shrimp and steak wasn't the only thing cooking\nI sat down to eat, ordered my food\nI said to the waitress, I don't men to be rude\nBut I'll take you on a platter\nShe said you got a girl, I said it don't matter\nYou look like you're tastier than a piping hot pizza\nWhat's your name, she said my tag says Lisa\nI said, O.K., you're smart and all that\nBut when you get off work, yo, I'll be back\nShe looked at me and said make yourself clear\nL where we going, I said right here\nShe looked kind of puzzled, I said you'll see\nI pulled up at ten on the D-O-T\nWhen she walked out the door, I threw my tongue down her throat\nPushed her back inside and pulled off her coat\nLaid her on the table and placed my order\nAnd gave her a tip much bigger than a quarter\nOn and on to the break'a dawn\nAll over the restaurant, word is bond\nI heard somebody coughing, I checked my watch\nI couldn't believe it said nine o'clock\nI grabbed my pants, put on my Kangol\nWho did I see, oh yo it was Brenda\nYo she worked at Red Lobster but I didn't remember\n\n[Hook]\nLisa got a big ole butt, I know I told you I'd be true\nBut Lisa got a big ole butt, so I'm leaving you - see ya\nLisa got a big ole butt, I know I told you I'd be true\nBut Lisa got a big ole butt, so I'm leaving you - see ya"}}, {"title": "Paradise", "album": "10", "year": "2002-12-14", "lyrics": "[Amerie harmonizes]\n\n[LL Cool

is rough, my neighbourhood is tough\nBut I still sport gold, and I'm out to crush\nMy name is Cool J, I devastate the show\nBut I couldn't survive without my radio\nTerrorising my neighbours with the heavy bass\nI keep the suckas in fear by the look on my face\nMy radio's bad from the Boulevard\nI'm a hip-hop gangster and my name is Todd\nJust stimulated by the beat, bust out the rhyme\nGet fresh batteries if it won't rewind\nCos I play everyday, even on the subway\nI woulda got a summons but I ran away\nI'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go\nBut I know I can't live without my radio\n\n[Verse 2]\nSuckas on my jock when I walk down the block\nI really don't care if you're jealous or not\nCos I make the songs, you sing along\nAnd your radio's def when my record's on\nSo get off the wall, become involved\nAll your radio problems have now been solved\nMy treacherous beats make ya ears respond\nAnd my radio's loud like a fire alarm\nThe floor vibrates, the walls cave in\nThe bass makes my eardrums seem thin\nDef sounds in my ride, yes the front and back\nYou would think it was a party, not a Cadillac\nCos I drive up to the ave, with the windows closed\nAnd my bass is so loud, it could rip your clothes\nMy stereo's thumpin' like a savage beast\nThe level on my power meter will not decrease\nSuckas get mad, cos the girlies scream\nAnd I'm still gettin' paid while you look at me mean\nI'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go\nBut I know I can't live without my radio\nI'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go\nAnd I know I can't live without my radio\n\n[Verse 3]\nDon't touch that dial, I'll be upset\nMight go into a fit and rip off your neck\nCos the radio's thumpin' when I'm down to play\nI'm the royal chief rocker LL Cool J\nLet your big butt bounce from right to left\nCos it's a actual fact this jam is def\nMost definitely created by me\nGoin' down in radio history\nI'm good to go on your radio\nAnd I'm cold gettin' paid cos Rick said so\nMake the woofers wallop and your tweeters twitch\nSome jealous knuckleheads might try to dis\nBut it's nuthin', ya frontin', ya girl I am stuntin'\nAnd my radio's loud enough to keep you gruntin'\nMy name is Cool J, I'm from the rock\nCirculating through your radio non-stop\nI'm lookin' at the wires behind the cassette\nAnd now I'm on the right, standing on the eject\nWearin' light blue Pumas, a whole lotta gold\nAnd jams like these keep me in control\nI'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go\nAnd I know I can't live without my radio\n\n[Verse 4]\nYour energy level starts to increase\nAs my big beat is slowly released\nI'm on the radio and at the jam\nLL Cool J is who I am\nI'mma make ya dance, boogie down and rock\nAnd you'll scratch and shake to my musical plot\nAnd to expand my musical plan\nCut Creator, rock the beat with your hands\n\nThat's right, so don't try to front the move\nAs you become motivated by the funky groove\nYou can see me and Earl chillin' on the block\nWith my box cold kickin' with the gangster rock\nSee people can't stop me, neither can the police\nI'm a musical maniac to say the least\nFor you and your radio I made this for\nCool J's here to devastate once more\nPullin' all the girls, takin' out MCs\nIf ya try to disrespect me, I just say Please!\nHere to command the hip-hop land\nKick it live with a box inside my hand\nI'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go\nBut I know I can't live without my radio\n\nFarmers Boulevard, yeah, you know that's where me and E hang out, cool out, you know what I'm sayin'? That's where the crib's at", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ef99c53227043515471cb5cbe3232f8e.600x600x1.jpg", "artist": "LL Cool J", "raw": {"annotation_count": 16, "api_path": "/songs/29096", "apple_music_id": "643349449", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/29096/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "The boombox was a big part of the 80s hip hop scene.

that can rock the crowd\nWalkin' down the street, to the hardcore beat\nWhile my JVC vibrates the concrete\nI'm sorry if you can't understand\nBut I need a radio inside my hand\nDon't mean to offend other citizens\nBut I kick my volume way past 10\nMy story is rough, my neighbourhood is tough\nBut I still sport gold, and I'm out to crush\nMy name is Cool J, I devastate the show\nBut I couldn't survive without my radio\nTerrorising my neighbours with the heavy bass\nI keep the suckas in fear by the look on my face\nMy radio's bad from the Boulevard\nI'm a hip-hop gangster and my name is Todd\nJust stimulated by the beat, bust out the rhyme\nGet fresh batteries if it won't rewind\nCos I play everyday, even on the subway\nI woulda got a summons but I ran away\nI'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go\nBut I know I can't live without my radio\n\n[Verse 2]\nSuckas on my jock when I walk down the block\nI really don't care if you're jealous or not\nCos I make the songs, you sing along\nAnd your radio's def when my record's on\nSo get off the wall, become involved\nAll your radio problems have now been solved\nMy treacherous beats make ya ears respond\nAnd my radio's loud like a fire alarm\nThe floor vibrates, the walls cave in\nThe bass makes my eardrums seem thin\nDef sounds in my ride, yes the front and back\nYou would think it was a party, not a Cadillac\nCos I drive up to the ave, with the windows closed\nAnd my bass is so loud, it could rip your clothes\nMy stereo's thumpin' like a savage beast\nThe level on my power meter will not decrease\nSuckas get mad, cos the girlies scream\nAnd I'm still gettin' paid while you look at me mean\nI'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go\nBut I know I can't live without my radio\nI'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go\nAnd I know I can't live without my radio\n\n[Verse 3]\nDon't touch that dial, I'll be upset\nMight go into a fit and rip off your neck\nCos the radio's thumpin' when I'm down to play\nI'm the royal chief rocker LL Cool J\nLet your big butt bounce from right to left\nCos it's a actual fact this jam is def\nMost definitely created by me\nGoin' down in radio history\nI'm good to go on your radio\nAnd I'm cold gettin' paid cos Rick said so\nMake the woofers wallop and your tweeters twitch\nSome jealous knuckleheads might try to dis\nBut it's nuthin', ya frontin', ya girl I am stuntin'\nAnd my radio's loud enough to keep you gruntin'\nMy name is Cool J, I'm from the rock\nCirculating through your radio non-stop\nI'm lookin' at the wires behind the cassette\nAnd now I'm on the right, standing on the eject\nWearin' light blue Pumas, a whole lotta gold\nAnd jams like these keep me in control\nI'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go\nAnd I know I can't live without my radio\n\n[Verse 4]\nYour energy level starts to increase\nAs my big beat is slowly released\nI'm on the radio and at the jam\nLL Cool J is who I am\nI'mma make ya dance, boogie down and rock\nAnd you'll scratch and shake to my musical plot\nAnd to expand my musical plan\nCut Creator, rock the beat with your hands\n\nThat's right, so don't try to front the move\nAs you become motivated by the funky groove\nYou can see me and Earl chillin' on the block\nWith my box cold kickin' with the gangster rock\nSee people can't stop me, neither can the police\nI'm a musical maniac to say the least\nFor you and your radio I made this for\nCool J's here to devastate once more\nPullin' all the girls, takin' out MCs\nIf ya try to disrespect me, I just say Please!\nHere to command the hip-hop land\nKick it live with a box inside my hand\nI'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go\nBut I know I can't live without my radio\n\nFarmers Boulevard, yeah, you know that's where me and E hang out, cool out, you know what I'm sayin'?

bumpin' with the bass in back\nAll the sophisticated suckers catch a heart attack\n'Cause they don't understand why I act this way\nPumpin' up the funky beat until the break of day\nIt's because I want attention when I'm ridin' by\nAnd the girls be on my jock 'cause my system's fly\n\n[Chorus]\n(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)\n(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)\n(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)\n(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)\n\n[Verse 2]\nGirlies wanna ride with a brother like me\n'Cause they be hear me gettin' funky frequently\nThey tell me don't drink and drive, I say what is this\nMind your business\nNow pass it around\nLaid back, hypnotized by the funky sound\nPeople in the street see me bobbin my head\nWhile I'm checkin' out the rapper and the rhyme that he said\nI'm frontin', and I don't care if you know\nThe backseat of my car is like a disco show\nYou would think I was a good friend of Al Capone\nCrazy air freshener, who needs cologne?\nBottom to the bottom to the top to the top\nCruise, it's 3 o'clock\nThe girlies, they smile, they see me comin'\nI'm steady hummin, I got the Funky Drummer drumming\nMy trunk be shakin', vibratin' and rattlin'\nPumpin so loud, all the shorties be babblin'\nMy right-hand man's here without the swing\nEvery chance I get I'm showin' off my rings\nI can keep it up until the break of dawn\n'Cause I'm frontin' in my ride and my word is bond\n\n[Chorus]\n(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)\n(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)\n(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)\n(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)\n\n[Verse 3]\nSunroof open, so I can feel the wind blow\nI don't give a damn if it cracks my back window\nC to the O to the O to the L to the I to the N\nTo the F to the R to the O to the N to the T to the I to the N\nThat means I'm chillin'\nLike Spoonie Gee said, my seats are soft like a bed\nThey recline way back, so I can get real cozy\nI got the gangster tapes in the place\nLike a basehead would say: I want BASS\nI want a hit, I want a dose\nYou're rollin' up smilin', but you can't come close\n'Cause my system is pumpin' loud\nLike Rakim said: I wanna move the crowd\nI warm it up with Kane, fight the power with PE\nTell the cops: you gots to chill with EPMD\nThis is something devastatin' that'll break your trunk\nAnd remember, Uncle L is like the future of the funk\n\n[Chorus]\n(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)\n(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)\n(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)\n(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)\n(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)\n(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)\n(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)\n(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)\n\n[Outro]\nYou know what I'm sayin', word\nSo next time you're in your ride pumpin' it up\nJust remember\nIt's cool\nPeace"}}, {"title": "Baby", "album": "Exit 13", "year": "2008-07-01", "lyrics": "[Intro: The Dream] (LL Cool J)\nLL (LL)\nI see you

looking at her in the limelight, pearly whites\nSaid her man get paper but he don't live right\nAll these emotions flowing inside the club\nDo you really want a thug or do ya want love?\nShe gets the paper when it's time to get it\nShe keep these clowns sinkin' like Chappaquiddick\nHoney smoke make you click, feel it in their throats\nNo joke, all these love letters they wrote\nBehind every playa is a true playette\nBounce you up, outta there, push eject\nTaster's choice, have you nice and moist\nOr play paper games or floss the Rolls Royce\n\n[Chorus]\nSomething like a phenomenon\nSomething like a phenomenon\nSomething like a phenomenon\nSomething like a phenomenon\nSomething like a phenomenon\nSomething like a phenomenon\nSomething like a phenomenon\nSomething like a phenomenon\n(uh huh) (go ahead daddy)\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou was king of seduction, cop a suction\nNow she with a cat that worked construction\nYou wanna starve her with the paper, abuse her mind\nThis a new lover, when you know it's on mine\nThat's on top, lap dancin' got to stop\nYou play out your chick cause your game is hot\nI give you two, Italian iced my whole crew\nPiece banging on my chest 'til I'm black and blue\nYou beefin', yellin' on the cell of my 6\nYou reachin', then you hear the cordless click\nNow your club hopping, keep the Cristal poppin'\nUse my chips and take the next man shoppin'\nHell no, must be out ya mind\nGot you on your knees and your elbows each and every time\nThat's why I love you mami, you\nRun your mouth, throw your legs over the bed baby\nWork me out\n\n[Chorus]\nSomething like a phenomenon\nSomething like a phenomenon\nSomething like a phenomenon\nSomething like a phenomenon\nSomething like a phenomenon\nSomething like a phenomenon\nSomething like a phenomenon\nSomething like a phenomenon\n(uh huh) (go ahead daddy)\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou was all souped up, but played it just right\nMami I was full blown, my game was airtight\nI needed to switch up and get it in gear\nIt's a whole new movie, a world premiere, yeah yeah\nKeep it jinglin', no more minglin'\nA brand new year, me and you can bring it in\nI was sick and tired of the freakin', night to morn'\nBonin' in the mirror with my Cubans on\nLet bygones be bygones, no more games\nHope all the chickenheads go up in flames\nNow we in the brand new mansion, with the lake in back\nGot it all figured out, mami I like that\nCollect tips, cop his and her whips\nTo waste a quarter mil on clothes is sick\nBut you're worth it playgirl, it's real in the field\nSay what you want, but keep your lips sealed\n\n[Chorus]\nSomething like a phenomenon\nSomething like a phenomenon\nSomething like a phenomenon\nSomething like a phenomenon\nSomething like a phenomenon\nSomething like a

"[Intro]\nAh yeah\nI wanna send this one out to all the jeep lovers worldwide\nCity to city, ghetto to ghetto\nSome flavor for you and yours\nAnd your jeep\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou're the type of girl that got class and style\nStill in all you need the backseat of my jeep once in a while\nSo I pull up to your door to give you what you're looking for\nUhh, hardcore\nI know you wanna come...in my jeep\nWe can park on a back street\nYou're checkin' out my carphone, scopin' out my jewelry\nLet's do this in a hurry\nAir freshener is kickin', drive through for chicken\nI know you need a good stickin'\nThat's when I see my man Snoop\nPeace, what up kid? loungin' duke\nAs I turn the corner, starin' in your cornea\nYou're gettin' hornier and hornier\nI'm pumpin' up a blend tape (flavor)\nYou're legs is incredible, I do a double take\nYou're puttin' on your lipstick\nI wanna give you this big fat...(yeeeaaa)\nQuick, I know a place where we can lounge and cool, don't sleep\n(where at?) back seat of my jeep\n\n[Chorus]\nBack seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode\nBack seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode\nBack seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode\nBack seat of my jeep, let's swing an ep'\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm pullin' over near your building\nI light a candle on the dashboard, we're chillin'\nI knew a girl like you would love a scene like this\nYou got class but deep down you're real freakish\nYou got it all, but you never had a wild episode\nThat's when me and my jeep showed\nUp with the funk in the trunk and\nHittin' it, we're spunkin'\nI'll even get you drunk and tipsy\nCause I know you're feelin' frisky\nYou love it cause it's wild and risky\nYou got your eyes on the hood\nYou're up to no good\nI took you in the back, you hoped I would\nYou got your black on black so stacked in the back\nWhile I'm pumpin' it the CD will skip a track\nWindows are foggy\nAnd, uh, back seat treats in the streets could be a hobby\nAnd you ain't in between the Isley Brothers' sheets\nI give it to you real raw in the backseat\nThat's how you want it, don't ya? (yeah)\nYou'll tell your girlfriends, won't ya? (nah)\nDon't lie\nTake it in your eye (Why?)\nSo buckle up, buckle up\nWhat's my name? what's my name? what's my name? what's my name? huh\nI never knew a four-wheel drive could be so live\nI'll put your numbers in the archives\nSo take 'em off, and put them things on the mirror girl\nIt's my jeep and your world\nYou got it going on lovely, time to do the right thing\nCause I can tell you wanna swing\n\n[Chorus]\nBack seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode\nBack seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode\nBack seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode\nBack seat of my jeep, let's swing an ep'\n\n[Verse 3]\nWe're bonin' on the dark blocks\nWearin' out the shocks, wettin' up the dashboard clock\nSeats full of sweat, I told ya I would get it\nYour kitty, kitty, cat, cat, was hungry so I

to ghetto\nSome flavor for you and yours\nAnd your jeep\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou're the type of girl that got class and style\nStill in all you need the backseat of my jeep once in a while\nSo I pull up to your door to give you what you're looking for\nUhh, hardcore\nI know you wanna come...in my jeep\nWe can park on a back street\nYou're checkin' out my carphone, scopin' out my jewelry\nLet's do this in a hurry\nAir freshener is kickin', drive through for chicken\nI know you need a good stickin'\nThat's when I see my man Snoop\nPeace, what up kid? loungin' duke\nAs I turn the corner, starin' in your cornea\nYou're gettin' hornier and hornier\nI'm pumpin' up a blend tape (flavor)\nYou're legs is incredible, I do a double take\nYou're puttin' on your lipstick\nI wanna give you this big fat...(yeeeaaa)\nQuick, I know a place where we can lounge and cool, don't sleep\n(where at?) back seat of my jeep\n\n[Chorus]\nBack seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode\nBack seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode\nBack seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode\nBack seat of my jeep, let's swing an ep'\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm pullin' over near your building\nI light a candle on the dashboard, we're chillin'\nI knew a girl like you would love a scene like this\nYou got class but deep down you're real freakish\nYou got it all, but you never had a wild episode\nThat's when me and my jeep showed\nUp with the funk in the trunk and\nHittin' it, we're spunkin'\nI'll even get you drunk and tipsy\nCause I know you're feelin' frisky\nYou love it cause it's wild and risky\nYou got your eyes on the hood\nYou're up to no good\nI took you in the back, you hoped I would\nYou got your black on black so stacked in the back\nWhile I'm pumpin' it the CD will skip a track\nWindows are foggy\nAnd, uh, back seat treats in the streets could be a hobby\nAnd you ain't in between the Isley Brothers' sheets\nI give it to you real raw in the backseat\nThat's how you want it, don't ya? (yeah)\nYou'll tell your girlfriends, won't ya? (nah)\nDon't lie\nTake it in your eye (Why?)\nSo buckle up, buckle up\nWhat's my name? what's my name? what's my name? what's my name? huh\nI never knew a four-wheel drive could be so live\nI'll put your numbers in the archives\nSo take 'em off, and put them things on the mirror girl\nIt's my jeep and your world\nYou got it going on lovely, time to do the right thing\nCause I can tell you wanna swing\n\n[Chorus]\nBack seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode\nBack seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode\nBack seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode\nBack seat of my jeep, let's swing an ep'\n\n[Verse 3]\nWe're bonin' on the dark blocks\nWearin' out the shocks, wettin' up the dashboard clock\nSeats full of sweat, I told ya I would get it\nYour kitty, kitty, cat, cat, was hungry so I fed it\nWorkin' as a team\nSomebody, anybody (scream)\nJump with me to the casbah\nI'll be like Bruce Lee in them skins goin' \"waahhh\"\nDamn, it's so good, the mad grip on my tip\nYou're still a nice girl but my jeep makes ya flip\nYou go wild and stick your toes on the roof (yeah yeah)\nYou're so cute, wit' your gold tooth\nExtensions on the carpet\nThat nice round brown is my target\nIt's so firm, so cushy, it makes me feel mushy\nI love it when it's pushy\nBut don't laugh, I'm serious with this (word up)\nThe back seat of my jeep is priceless\nYou're climaxin', you're climaxin', it's full action\nYou love a good waxin', it's so relaxin'\nAhhh, give me a hug\nSee what I'm sayin' love?\n\n[Chorus]\nBack seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode\nBack seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode\nBack seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode\nBack seat of my jeep, let's swing an ep'"}}, {"title": "No More", "album": null, "year": "2011-11-13", "lyrics": "We need to have a conversation\n\n[Verse 1: LL Cool J]\nI made you, why would I play you?\nTrade home base for a California angel\nSwing at a fast bitch, foul out betray you\nWhen I won't even wanna hit it in a day or two\nStraight home I'd run, well that's debatable\nI can't front, I hit a slump, all players do\nBut tough times are minor, to a major dude\nWe all lose sometimes, I call it paying dues\nNow you're searching other clubs for what's available\nA year ago my slot was unassailable\nMy feast is a famine without you to cater to\nIf these walls could talk, what would they say to you?\n\n[Hook: Ne-Yo]\nDon't understand what we're going though\nBut it's like you don't know me\nAnd I don't know you, no more\nNot no more!\nAnd it's like, damn how the hell we get here?\nNo idea, but we're not what we were before\nCould it be that I don't love you\nAnd you don't love me no more?\nThat girl don't live here, not no more!\nYeah, yeah, yeah, that girl no more!\n\n[Verse 2: LL Cool J]\nThe dining room has an empty chair\nThe mirrored staircase has an empty stair\nHouse full of company, but no ones here\nWe're saying cheers while we're holding back tears\nTo keep up appearances in front of our peers\nWe play holiday card tricks every year\nBlack jack, poker, make the joker disappear\nThe ace can't breathe when there's tension in the air\nThree clubs in one night, but nobody cares\nCause it's still not a full house without a pair\nYou tipped your hand, but the text wasn't clear\nYou're dealing from the bottom queen of hearts, play fair!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: LL Cool J]\nSlip in the door, you hold my hopes so\nAll I hear is love don't live here anymore\nWe can tear the house down or build some scaffold\nWe're sitting on a fence, so where you wanna go?\nYou're the architect of your life, it's your show\nYou create the blueprint and how the rooms flow\nBefore you burn the house down, think, take it slow\nEven arsonists needs shelter, let me know!\n\n[Hook]",

"lyrics": "We need to have a conversation\n\n[Verse 1: LL Cool J]\nI made you, why would I play you?\nTrade home base for a California angel\nSwing at a fast bitch, foul out betray you\nWhen I won't even wanna hit it in a day or two\nStraight home I'd run, well that's debatable\nI can't front, I hit a slump, all players do\nBut tough times are minor, to a major dude\nWe all lose sometimes, I call it paying dues\nNow you're searching other clubs for what's available\nA year ago my slot was unassailable\nMy feast is a famine without you to cater to\nIf these walls could talk, what would they say to you?\n\n[Hook: Ne-Yo]\nDon't understand what we're going though\nBut it's like you don't know me\nAnd I don't know you, no more\nNot no more!\nAnd it's like, damn how the hell we get here?\nNo idea, but we're not what we were before\nCould it be that I don't love you\nAnd you don't love me no more?\nThat girl don't live here, not no more!\nYeah, yeah, yeah, that girl no more!\n\n[Verse 2: LL Cool J]\nThe dining room has an empty chair\nThe mirrored staircase has an empty stair\nHouse full of company, but no ones here\nWe're saying cheers while we're holding back tears\nTo keep up appearances in front of our peers\nWe play holiday card tricks every year\nBlack jack, poker, make the joker disappear\nThe ace can't breathe when there's tension in the air\nThree clubs in one night, but nobody cares\nCause it's still not a full house without a pair\nYou tipped your hand, but the text wasn't clear\nYou're dealing from the bottom queen of hearts, play fair!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: LL Cool J]\nSlip in the door, you hold my hopes so\nAll I hear is love don't live here anymore\nWe can tear the house down or build some scaffold\nWe're sitting on a fence, so where you wanna go?\nYou're the architect of your life, it's your show\nYou create the blueprint and how the rooms flow\nBefore you burn the house down, think, take it slow\nEven arsonists needs shelter, let me know!\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "Rock the Bells (Original)", "album": null, "year": "1985-01-01", "lyrics": "* appears as a b-side to the \"Rock the Bells\" twelve inch\n\nRumor has it that you're tired of my scratchin' and drums\nAnd of couse I wanna expand to the maximum\nSo I injected one more element to that of L.L\nCame up with something' funky called Rock the Bells\n\nDuring this episode vocally I explode\nMy title is the king of the FM mode\nSee,My volume expands to consume\nAnd my structures emote a lyrical heirloom\nVocally pulsating, I initiate gyrating\nYa must respond to my bells, there's no waiting\nFor the duration, there's no articulation\nReceiving ovation for the bell association\nThe vocalization techniques I employ\nThe voice of my shadow could dust a toy boy\nThe injection of bells into this beat\nThe result: enough energy to amputate your feet\nGreater insulator microphone dominator\nMy name is Cool J, manipulator innovator\nConnoisseur, I'm sure my percussion will excite\nThese bells are gonna rock all night\nRock the bells\n\nThe bells make your energy escalate\nA sort of musical fury L.L. might detonate\nSubject matter entitled \"The Bells\"\nThe lyrical arrangement is by L.L\nMy program strains the tympanic membrane\nI've been ordained the BLZ I'll flame\nParagraphs I concoct, Cut Creator's like an organist\nCool J exists as a journalist\nI illuminate over any number on the Richter\nMy throat contracts like a boa constrictor\nYou're totally engulfed by the structure and the format\nIt's not dormant, it goes to the cornerman\nAs you repent, you'll say I win\nTo torture individuals for exitement\nAmbassador, the Thane of Cawdor\nDialect so def, it'll rip up the floor\nIgnite and excite with verbal extensions\nWhat I'll mention will put you on pension\nMakin' you tremble, nothin' resemble\nThe bells and if it does\nI'll disassemble\nHit if you bit\nI go have a fit\nThe master impresario of lyrical wit\nA hip-hop creature, concert feature\nAmateur teacher, my rhymes reach ya\nWhen I commence with excellence\nIt eradicates levels of pestilence\nUpon a plateau\nNo mortal can go\nMythological characters stand below\nRock the bells\n\nA B-boy symphony complete with bells\nNo classical fanatic is parallel\nFrom the design of my lyrics many people call me\nAn immortalized B-boy prodigy\nEeee a misdemeanor, cleaner women I subpoena\nNo conjecture in my lecture, name and adversary Gina\nPromoter, my tune revolves like rotor\nWhilst I decode-a the cranium of Yoda\nRehearsing steadily, growing I sing tweeters, mid-range\nAnd woofers need guarding\nThe bells rip your auditory canal\nPlagiarism is suicide for then I shall\nBe forced to assault\nOpposition will halt\nUpset you with words\nDrink your blood like it's a malt\nOpposite of illusions\nEvidently it's true\nThe beat metabolism supposed to accelerate you\nHallucinating severe convulsion\nYour equilibrium is took from my propolsion\nI came here tonight to rock\nThese bells will never stop\nRock the Bells\n\nYa livin' on my live side\nAutographs I sign\nInferior fan-recorder of my rhyme\nPerfect spectator, well I'm the dominator\nYou reline and refine, it and you save it for later\nSwipe it as you type it\nYou recite it as you bite it\nThen you claim it as your own to get them excited\nAbout it as you shout it\nYou don't tell them how go it\nAnd you repeat it and rock it\nMultiply it, divide it, ya even sit inside it\nIt's L.L.'s rhyme, I know ya wanna bite it\nYou announce, I pounce, destroy, annihilate\nIf you break, you'll be straight when I eliminate\nYou study like scholars even write 'em on your collars\nYou'll buy em and you'll try even for a million dollars\nI get like a leopard, attack, ransack, disturb, cold crush\nUse a line, I make 'em hush\nThe lovers in the taker, faker, lovers of the Lakers, simulator\nRap traitor,l perfect perpetrator\nTo see ya as you bite the words\nYou'd think you never heard\nThe mic sings like a hummin' bird\nRock the Bells\n\nJack the Ripper\nKing Hercules\nProfessor of Death in the Seven Seas\nGrim reaper of rhyme\nHolder of the rock\nEradicating suckers all around the clock\nThe supreme machine\nA microphone dream\nMy revenge is brutal when you start to scheme\nI mean, you're my adversary, I enjoy the few\nThe Peruvian rock, cocaine or quaalude\nThe story, the beginning of your death is heard\nBut your cries are ignored by the kind of word\nI'm the super insane murderer in the reign\nLike a vampire goin' for your jugular vein\nExterminating crews with my manuscript\nAnd the best thing you wrote was a bunch of bullshit\nThe night of the nights\nYou're my victim tonight\nYou ain't nothin' nobody so get outta any sight\nBein' crushed by the source\nIt's reinforced (thoughts)\nNow ya feel remorse cause ya know who's boss\nL.L. Cool J is your undertaker\nDef hit-maker plus a bone-breaker\nTreble terminator, bass mutilator\nYou can drop your drawers, I'm a rapper castrator\nOn the microphone you will never recoup\nWhen I'm finished with you, boy, you'll be suckin' on soup\nMusic virtuoso, melodical employer\nI knew you was a sucker, first time I saw ya\nRoll the red carpet, royalty's arrived\nDon't try to fight back cause you won't survive\nSo don't never ever in any kind of weather\nTry to mess with the tall young legend in leather\nL.L. servin' 'em well\nThe beat elevates and the scratch excels\nRock the

"lyrics": "* appears as a b-side to the \"Rock the Bells\" twelve inch\n\nRumor has it that you're tired of my scratchin' and drums\nAnd of couse I wanna expand to the maximum\nSo I injected one more element to that of L.L\nCame up with something' funky called Rock the Bells\n\nDuring this episode vocally I explode\nMy title is the king of the FM mode\nSee,My volume expands to consume\nAnd my structures emote a lyrical heirloom\nVocally pulsating, I initiate gyrating\nYa must respond to my bells, there's no waiting\nFor the duration, there's no articulation\nReceiving ovation for the bell association\nThe vocalization techniques I employ\nThe voice of my shadow could dust a toy boy\nThe injection of bells into this beat\nThe result: enough energy to amputate your feet\nGreater insulator microphone dominator\nMy name is Cool J, manipulator innovator\nConnoisseur, I'm sure my percussion will excite\nThese bells are gonna rock all night\nRock the bells\n\nThe bells make your energy escalate\nA sort of musical fury L.L. might detonate\nSubject matter entitled \"The Bells\"\nThe lyrical arrangement is by L.L\nMy program strains the tympanic membrane\nI've been ordained the BLZ I'll flame\nParagraphs I concoct, Cut Creator's like an organist\nCool J exists as a journalist\nI illuminate over any number on the Richter\nMy throat contracts like a boa constrictor\nYou're totally engulfed by the structure and the format\nIt's not dormant, it goes to the cornerman\nAs you repent, you'll say I win\nTo torture individuals for exitement\nAmbassador, the Thane of Cawdor\nDialect so def, it'll rip up the floor\nIgnite and excite with verbal extensions\nWhat I'll mention will put you on pension\nMakin' you tremble, nothin' resemble\nThe bells and if it does\nI'll disassemble\nHit if you bit\nI go have a fit\nThe master impresario of lyrical wit\nA hip-hop creature, concert feature\nAmateur teacher, my rhymes reach ya\nWhen I commence with excellence\nIt eradicates levels of pestilence\nUpon a plateau\nNo mortal can go\nMythological characters stand below\nRock the bells\n\nA B-boy symphony complete with bells\nNo classical fanatic is parallel\nFrom the design of my lyrics many people call me\nAn immortalized B-boy prodigy\nEeee a misdemeanor, cleaner women I subpoena\nNo conjecture in my lecture, name and adversary Gina\nPromoter, my tune revolves like rotor\nWhilst I decode-a the cranium of Yoda\nRehearsing steadily, growing I sing tweeters, mid-range\nAnd woofers need guarding\nThe bells rip your auditory canal\nPlagiarism is suicide for then I shall\nBe forced to assault\nOpposition will halt\nUpset you with words\nDrink your blood like it's a malt\nOpposite of illusions\nEvidently it's true\nThe beat metabolism supposed to accelerate you\nHallucinating severe convulsion\nYour equilibrium is took from my propolsion\nI came here tonight to rock\nThese bells will never stop\nRock the Bells\n\nYa livin' on my live side\nAutographs I sign\nInferior fan-recorder of my rhyme\nPerfect spectator, well I'm the dominator\nYou reline and refine, it and you save it for later\nSwipe it as you type it\nYou recite it as you bite it\nThen you claim it as your own to get them excited\nAbout it as you shout it\nYou don't tell them how go it\nAnd you repeat it and rock it\nMultiply it, divide it, ya even sit inside it\nIt's L.L.'s rhyme, I know ya wanna bite it\nYou announce, I pounce, destroy, annihilate\nIf you break, you'll be straight when I eliminate\nYou study like scholars even write 'em on your collars\nYou'll buy em and you'll try even for a million dollars\nI get like a leopard, attack, ransack, disturb, cold crush\nUse a line, I make 'em hush\nThe lovers in the taker, faker, lovers of the Lakers, simulator\nRap traitor,l perfect perpetrator\nTo see ya as you bite the words\nYou'd think you never heard\nThe mic sings like a hummin' bird\nRock the Bells\n\nJack the Ripper\nKing Hercules\nProfessor of Death in the Seven Seas\nGrim reaper of rhyme\nHolder of the rock\nEradicating suckers all around the clock\nThe supreme machine\nA microphone dream\nMy revenge is brutal when you start to scheme\nI mean, you're my adversary, I enjoy the few\nThe Peruvian rock, cocaine or quaalude\nThe story, the beginning of your death is heard\nBut your cries are ignored by the kind of word\nI'm the super insane murderer in the reign\nLike a vampire goin' for your jugular vein\nExterminating crews with my manuscript\nAnd the best thing you wrote was a bunch of bullshit\nThe night of the nights\nYou're my victim tonight\nYou ain't nothin' nobody so get outta any sight\nBein' crushed by the source\nIt's reinforced (thoughts)\nNow ya feel remorse cause ya know who's boss\nL.L. Cool J is your undertaker\nDef hit-maker plus a bone-breaker\nTreble terminator, bass mutilator\nYou can drop your drawers, I'm a rapper castrator\nOn the microphone you will never recoup\nWhen I'm finished with you, boy, you'll be suckin' on soup\nMusic virtuoso, melodical employer\nI knew you was a sucker, first time I saw ya\nRoll the red carpet, royalty's arrived\nDon't try to fight back cause you won't survive\nSo don't never ever in any kind of weather\nTry to mess with the tall young legend in leather\nL.L. servin' 'em well\nThe beat elevates and the scratch excels\nRock the Bells"}}, {"title": "Control Myself", "album": "Todd Smith", "year": "2006-02-05", "lyrics": "[Jennifer Lopez]\nNo me puedo controlar\nAqui con el Se\u00f1or LL Cool J\nY aqui estoy... ya tu

through like how I do\nThis girl began to tempt me (Uh-huh!)\nShe said her name Shayeeda\nI could tell her mama feed her (Yeah!)\nWhen they tight and thick them jeans don't fit\nI'm L, nice to meet ya (Uh-oh!)\nI could feel my body yearning\nThe room just started turning\nDidn't want to go out on the floor\nBut this girl was so determined\nMy brain began to sizzle\nI'm sweatin' just a little\nOn the dance floor in the middle\nShe turned around and giggled\nShe said\n\n[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]\nYou got, you got, you got\nWhat it takes to make me leave my man\nIt's hard to control

(Yeah)\nWe barely know each other\nYet we're wilding like we're lovers\nThe air is full of passion\nThe strobe lights are flashin'\nThe hustlers throw cashin'\nThe bartender keeps splashin'\nHer moves were so erotic\nHer gaze was so hypnotic\nI begged this girl to stop it\nBut she continued to pop it\nYou know I know you like it\nLet me hit you on your Sidekick\nBecause the after party is at my

touched, the ground, it turned, me out\nI'm battling desire\nLord help me douse this fire\nThis internal inferno\nHotter than a shot of Cuervo\nHer top was short and purple\nBelly dancing in a

J\nY aqui estoy... ya tu sabes\nUno, dos, tres, muevete!\n\n[Jermaine Dupri]\nYa'll know what this is...So...So...Def!\n\n[Verse 1: LL Cool J]\nThe club was far from empty\nIt was crowded at the entry (Woo!)\nI slide right through like how I do\nThis girl began to tempt me (Uh-huh!)\nShe said her name Shayeeda\nI could tell her mama feed her (Yeah!)\nWhen they tight and thick them jeans don't fit\nI'm L, nice to meet ya (Uh-oh!)\nI could feel my body yearning\nThe room just started turning\nDidn't want to go out on the floor\nBut this girl was so determined\nMy brain began to sizzle\nI'm sweatin' just a little\nOn the dance floor in the middle\nShe turned around and giggled\nShe said\n\n[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]\nYou got, you got, you got\nWhat it takes to make me leave my man\nIt's hard to control myself (Aww!)\nIt's hard to control myself\nYou got, you got, you got\nWhat it takes to make this boy be bad\nIt's hard to control myself\nIt's hard to control myself\nIt's hard for me to control myself (Me too)\nAnd to hold myself back from jumpin' on ya\nLike I wanna, like I wanna, wanna\n\n[Verse 2: LL Cool J with Jennifer Lopez]\nTemptation is a mother\nHow we lust for one another (Yeah)\nWe barely know each other\nYet we're wilding like we're lovers\nThe air is full of passion\nThe strobe lights are flashin'\nThe hustlers throw cashin'\nThe bartender keeps splashin'\nHer moves were so erotic\nHer gaze was so hypnotic\nI begged this girl to stop it\nBut she continued to pop it\nYou know I know you like it\nLet me hit you on your Sidekick\nBecause the after party is at my body\nMeet me you're invited\nShe said\n\n[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]\nYou got, you got, you got\nWhat it takes to make me leave my man\nIt's hard to control myself (Aww!)\nIt's hard to control myself\nYou got, you got, you got\nWhat it takes to make this boy be bad\nIt's hard to control myself\nIt's hard to control myself\nIt's hard for me to control myself (Me too)\nAnd to hold myself back from jumpin' on ya\nLike I wanna, like I wanna, wanna\n\n[Verse 3: LL Cool J]\nShe licked, off, her lip, gloss\nHer hips, tossed, back, and forth\nSide, to side, and up, and down\nShe touched, the ground, it turned, me out\nI'm battling desire\nLord help me douse this fire\nThis internal inferno\nHotter than a shot of Cuervo\nHer top was short and purple\nBelly dancing in a circle\nWhen I feel like this I can't resist\nStop it don't make me hurt you\n\n[Jermaine Dupri]\nShe said\n\n[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]\nYou got, you got, you got\nWhat it takes to make me leave my man\nIt's hard to control myself (Aww!)\nIt's hard to control myself\nYou got, you got, you got\nWhat it takes to make this boy be bad\nIt's hard to control myself\nIt's hard to control myself\nIt's hard for me to control myself (Me too)\nAnd to hold myself back from jumpin' on ya\nLike I wanna, like I wanna, wanna\n\n[LL Cool J]\nZihZih ZihZihZih\nZihZihZih ZihZih

(TM)\n\n[LL Cool J]\nOh me? ... My name is L\nFirst of all you a banger, straight up and down\nI'm seein minks on your hangers\nI know your momma told you don't talk to strangers\nThat leads to dangerous situations, but I can't be patient\nYou need communication, appreciation\nRespect for your style instead of talkin all wild\nOne smile, you're daydreamin of walkin the aisle\nIn the waterbed, rollin around in a money pile\nBaby my format is not to be a doormat\nBut I still pull your chair out at the table and all that\nTouch your back softly, whatever it cost me\nTime money or energy, you will remember me\n\n[Ne-Yo]\nGotta change my answering machine, now that I'm alone\nCause right now it says that we, can't come to the phone\nAnd I know it makes no sense, cause you walked out the door\nBut it's the only way I hear your voice, anymore\n(It's ridiculous) It's been months, and for some reason I just\n(Can't get over us) And I'm stronger than this\n(Enough is enough) No more walkin 'round with my head down\nI'm so over bein blue, cryin over you; and\n\n[Hook: Ne-Yo]\nI'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears\nSo done with wishin, you were still here\nSaid I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow\nSo why can't I turn off the radio?\n\n[Ne-Yo]\nGotta fix that calender I have, that's marked July 15th\nBecause since there's no more you, there's no more anniversary\nI'm so fed up with my thoughts of you, and your memory\nAnd how every song reminds me of what used to be; that's the reason\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Interlude: Ne-Yo]\n(Leave me alone) Leave me alone\n(Stupid love songs) Don't make me think about her smile\nOr having my first child\nI'm lettin go, turnin off the radio\n\n[LL Cool J]\nI'mma keep you equipped in all of the best whips\nPay attention to detail, even your lipstick\nGive compliments when your pedicure switch\nWhen we on the mattress, you won't care if I'm rich\nI'll love you deeply, whisper sweetly\nEven when you critique me, you can still reach me\nBeats me why you sweeter than a peach be\nOne bite's enough sugar for the whole night\nYou'll be aight, you rollin with the Elvis of rap\nC'mon, move your pelvis and throw it back\nI know it's forward and it sounds a little blunt\nBut love money respect, whatever, pick what you want\n\n[Ne-Yo] That's the reason\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Ne-Yo] Said\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Ne-Yo] And\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Ne-Yo]\nWhy can't I turn off the

know\n\n[Verse 1: LL Cool J]\nI'm the best when it comes to makin' love all night\nThrow your butterscotch body beneath the red light\nBlaze it up girl, I'ma lace it real tight\nGo deep 'til the full moon turn to sunlight\n'Til the darkness is gone love remains strong\nLike the bond between mother and child, you're so warm to the touch\nPassionate interludes is such\nWhen your gone, your body's what I yearn to clutch\nJust imagine ecstasy floatin' in a cloud\nAnimal attraction burnin' through the crowd\nHeaven on Earth, paradise for a price\nIt's cool though, I'll pay it for the rest of my life, you know why\n\n[Chorus: Chaka Khan sample (LL Cool J)]\nAin't nobody does me better\nMakes me happy, makes me feel this way\nAin't nobody does me better\n(You can take it girl, stop runnin', uh)\n(You can take it girl, stop runnin', uh)\n(You can take it girl, stop runnin', uh)\n\n[Verse 2: LL Cool J]\nI'm explorin' your body and your erogenous zones\nLike a black tiger caged up, 'til you come home\nLovely, you make a man swoon like a boy\nThe love is so soft, it gets hard to enjoy\nCause the mind flies, and sometimes the sex lies\nSmooth little girls fall in love with rough guys\nBut you can chop a big heart down to pint size\nI guess that's what it sounds like when the dove cries\nUh, the whole world is trapped up in a maze\nBut you save this real good lovin' for rainy days\nUh, the lord works in mysterious ways\nHe must have put you on this Earth for all men to praise\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3: LL Cool J]\nAs I travel through your body our souls become one\nIndivisible, uh, it's getting critical son\nI'm on the run from love, it chased me out the bag\nGet the point boo, you hit it right on the head\nIt's an endless adventure, two bodies collide\nKing fulfilling dreams with a queen by his side\nForever, infinite time we intertwine\nDestiny, we fall in love by design\nWhat's yours is mine and what's mine is yours\nThe road less travelled is ours to explore\nI adore you, heavenly angel shine light\nHold my hand, I'll be your guide through the night\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Interlude: LL Cool J]\nCome on now, a man chooses a woman\nA woman chooses a man, give you half for a second\nThen I'll give you the full plunge, uh\nWhat you want? What you want? What you want?\nIce out infiltrates the scenery, nahmean\nIt's bananas ain't it\n\n[Chorus]"}}, {"title": "That's a Lie", "album": "Radio", "year": "1985-11-18", "lyrics": "[ Russell Simmons ]\nYo man, I got this def Rolex watch, man\n$100,000 watch, man\nI sell it to you for 400\n- You got 80?\nDig - dig this, man\nI got a rich, rich, rich, rich girl, man...\n\n[ L.L.

man...\n\n[ L.L. Cool J ]\nI'm sick and tired of the stories that you always tell\nShakespeare couldn't tell a story that well\nSee, you're the largest liar that was ever created\nYou and Pinocchio are probably related\nFull of criss-crossed fits, you lie all the time\nYour tongue should be embarrassed, you're a threat to mankind\nThat's a lie\n\n[ Russell Simmons ]\nYou know what my records is about, man\nYou know how much money we get, man\nCome on\n(You're a liar)\nMe and my man Rick got millions of gold albums\n(That's a lie)\nI'm gettin cold money every day\n(You're a liar)\nYou'll need a wheel barrow for all that shit in my office\n\n[ L.L. Cool J ]\nYou lied about the lies that you lied about\nYou even lied to your aunt when you went down south\nYou lied, and a body builder kicked your butt\nIf you was in Egypt you'd lie to King Tut\nYou claim to do things no one could achieve\nYou said you did things Ripley's wouldn't believe\nThat's a lie\n\n[ Russell Simmons ]\nI got this Japanese girl, man\nLee, man, takes good care of me\n(You're a liar)\nYo, she's so def, man\nWipes my butt\n(That's a lie)\nEverybody be beefin, man, about what Rush doin\n(You're a liar)\nYou seen my new Mercedes, man?\n\n[ L.L.

baby you might have to skip town\nSee something's smellin' fishy and they say it's you\nAll I know is that you made it with the whole damn crew\nThey say you're a man-eater during the full moon\nMascot of the senior boys' locker room\nThey said Yvette walked in, there wasn't too much rap\nHer reputation got bigger, and so did her gap\nCuz girl your momma shoulda taught you better\nI'mma sit down and write you a long letter\n\n[Chorus]\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm glad you ain't my sister, then again if you was\nI'd have to treat you like you was my distant cuz\nI'm not a news reporter, I don't mean to assume\nWhat should I think? I seen ya comin' out the men's bathroom\nYou wasn't in there alone, wasn't usin' the phone\nThe door was locked for twenty minutes, all I heard was \"Moan\"\n\n[Chorus]\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\n\n[Verse 3]\nI don't really know if the story is so\nI can either ask Curly, or Larry or Moe\nOr Earl, Shabazz, Lou, Mookie or Joe\nLike Santa Claus said, you're a ho-ho-ho\nIn every disco you say hello\nLike you're a little angel, but we all know\nSince you was eleven you been actin' this way\nYou always got in bed when you wanted to play\nYou're a freak, you think you're Lady Godiva\nSome freaks are live, but Yvette you're liver\n\n[Chorus]\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\n\n[Verse 4]\nYou're a back-seat queen, a elevator pro\nA high-powered body makes your Levis grow\nSee the stories I've heard, they could amaze\nI heard she did it on a motorcycle back in the days\nSo calm down freak, get a G.E.D\nThat's a General Education on Decency\nOne day you'll see, and agree with me\nUnless you're gonna be a freak until you're 93\nFor you there's no fee, everything is free\nThis is from me to you, not you to me\nEvery night is your night, your leather pants are tight\nYou try to shake your butt with all your might\nI don't really wanna dis nobody\nYou might think I had a little too much Bacardi\nBut that's not the problem, the problem's Yvette\nHow bad can a girl's reputation get?\nSee she's the kinda girl all the homeboys met\nIf you're desperate ask Yvette, cuz she'll say \"Bet\"\n\n[Chorus]\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\n\n[Verse 5]\nB-Boys are hard on the boulevard\nThe Reverend at the church said you was barred\nHomeboys on the block love you a lot\nYou're a real famous freak whether you like it or not\nSo before you start walking and your beak starts squawkin'\nLet me explain to you who is talkin'\nI'm L.L. Cool J from around the way\nYou boogie down to my records almost every day\nGo a hundred miles an hour when you're standin' still\nYou're faster than my Caddy when it's goin' downhill\nWon't forget that day in the Y.M.C.A\nThe guy at the desk said it was OK\nFor you to come inside cuz he knew you'd stay\nGreg G. and Garfield yelled \"Hooray\"\n\n[Chorus]\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette"}}, {"title": "Kanday", "album": "Bigger and Deffer", "year": "1987-05-29", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI met this new girl with big juicy lips\nAnd nice round hips, I mean her body's a trip\nAnd when I go over her house, you know what I like?\nThe way she tells me \"take it off\" and never says \"syke\"\nYo, I'm never in need, she's feedin my greed\nShe never waits for me to ask, she takes the lead\nHer tongue is sticky, and hickeys are her specialty\nE wants her, but she saves the good stuff for me\nHer name is Kanday, she's dandier than Dandy Don\nYou're mad and I'm happy that she put me on\nI'll never leave her for nothin, only a crazy man would\nThat's why I had to tell ya that\n\n[Chorus]\n(I feel good) about Kanday\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow and Laters, gum drops, jelly beans\nBrothers beg for the leg, she's on the cheerleading team\nIt feels wicked, everytime I stick it, that's right\nWhen we're alone she never ever acts polite\nHey yo, she blows me kisses, she does my dishes\nI wished I bust two and she grants my wishes\nShe's clever in bed, she uses her head\nShe's the kinda girl that keeps a fat man well fed\nLeft to right all night, the chick's outta sight\nI broke my lamp shade in half because I don't use a light\nMan, she's juicy like a berry, chocolate with the cherry\nAsk me if it's good and I'll have to say very\nWouldn't leave her for nothin, only a crazy man would\nThat's why I had to tell ya that\n\n[Chorus]\n(I feel good) about Kanday\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm feelin gooder than good, if you wouldn't I would\nIf you could, I know you could, she's kickin back in the hood\nWhen she starts to get off she can knock off a cough\nI know 'cough' don't rhyme with 'boss', but she made me her boss\nShe's the talk of my room whenever I'm in my room\nMy little brother loves her more than his favorite cartoon\nHer body's bad, the girl's built, skin like silk\nWet, steamy and warm just like a hot cup of milk\nShe's all the way live, keeps me satisfied\nI don't go outside, I like to stay inside\nHer ways are like an angel, with bright white wings\nAnd I'm crazy 'bout the way Kanday shakes her thing\nWouldn't leave her for nothin, only a crazy man would\nThat's why I had to tell ya that\n\n[Chorus]\n(I feel good) about Kanday\n\n[Verse 4]\nOoh, you couldn't imagine, I'm lickin my lips\nIf she was tea I'd take a sip, when I'm in gym I do flips\nI'm in love with the pizznoot, it's proper as hell\nI'm hittin harder than hard, always makin her yell\nShe's cooler than an iceberg, word to the mother\nIn the house, down the steps and under the covers\nRight away, no sation, or frontin, or playin\nOr delayin, I'm never steppin off, I'm always stayin\nHer mother knows me well, father hates my guts\nHe don't know when we're alone she's always feelin on my niggy-niggy-nuts\nFor a snack, cornflakes, crackerjacks\nDay after day I try to break that back\nAnd man, oh man, damn, you can't and I can\nLast time I saw her ex-man, I had to shake homeboys' hand\nI said \"what up\", he said \"what up\", \"I took your girl, so what up?\"\nGotta walk on the ground with a hole to fill up\nAll the boys laugh about her, Darryl and Dewayne\nBobcat and Earl, but they must be insane\nMichael Spelling's on my side, and big Chuck agrees\nShe's my private freaky deak, my own personal skeez\nWouldn't leave her for nothin, only a crazy man would\nThat's why I had to tell ya that (I - feel - good)\n\n[Chorus]\n(I feel good) about Kanday", "image": "https://images.genius.com/360d16b8aeb2fd205516a7b8c96f11b2.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "LL Cool J", "raw": {"annotation_count": 13,

"lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI met this new girl with big juicy lips\nAnd nice round hips, I mean her body's a trip\nAnd when I go over her house, you know what I like?\nThe way she tells me \"take it off\" and never says \"syke\"\nYo, I'm never in need, she's feedin my greed\nShe never waits for me to ask, she takes the lead\nHer tongue is sticky, and hickeys are her specialty\nE wants her, but she saves the good stuff for me\nHer name is Kanday, she's dandier than Dandy Don\nYou're mad and I'm happy that she put me on\nI'll never leave her for nothin, only a crazy man would\nThat's why I had to tell ya that\n\n[Chorus]\n(I feel good) about Kanday\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow and Laters, gum drops, jelly beans\nBrothers beg for the leg, she's on the cheerleading team\nIt feels wicked, everytime I stick it, that's right\nWhen we're alone she never ever acts polite\nHey yo, she blows me kisses, she does my dishes\nI wished I bust two and she grants my wishes\nShe's clever in bed, she uses her head\nShe's the kinda girl that keeps a fat man well fed\nLeft to right all night, the chick's outta sight\nI broke my lamp shade in half because I don't use a light\nMan, she's juicy like a berry, chocolate with the cherry\nAsk me if it's good and I'll have to say very\nWouldn't leave her for nothin, only a crazy man would\nThat's why I had to tell ya that\n\n[Chorus]\n(I feel good) about Kanday\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm feelin gooder than good, if you wouldn't I would\nIf you could, I know you could, she's kickin back in the hood\nWhen she starts to get off she can knock off a cough\nI know 'cough' don't rhyme with 'boss', but she made me her boss\nShe's the talk of my room whenever I'm in my room\nMy little brother loves her more than his favorite cartoon\nHer body's bad, the girl's built, skin like silk\nWet, steamy and warm just like a hot cup of milk\nShe's all the way live, keeps me satisfied\nI don't go outside, I like to stay inside\nHer ways are like an angel, with bright white wings\nAnd I'm crazy 'bout the way Kanday shakes her thing\nWouldn't leave her for nothin, only a crazy man would\nThat's why I had to tell ya that\n\n[Chorus]\n(I feel good) about Kanday\n\n[Verse 4]\nOoh, you couldn't imagine, I'm lickin my lips\nIf she was tea I'd take a sip, when I'm in gym I do flips\nI'm in love with the pizznoot, it's proper as hell\nI'm hittin harder than hard, always makin her yell\nShe's cooler than an iceberg, word to the mother\nIn the house, down the steps and under the covers\nRight away, no sation, or frontin, or playin\nOr delayin, I'm never steppin off, I'm always stayin\nHer mother knows me well, father hates my guts\nHe don't know when we're alone she's always feelin on my niggy-niggy-nuts\nFor a snack, cornflakes, crackerjacks\nDay after day I try to break that back\nAnd man, oh man, damn, you can't and I can\nLast time I saw her ex-man, I had to shake homeboys' hand\nI said \"what up\", he said \"what up\", \"I took your girl, so what up?\"\nGotta walk on the ground with a hole to fill up\nAll the boys laugh about her, Darryl and Dewayne\nBobcat and Earl, but they must be insane\nMichael Spelling's on my side, and big Chuck agrees\nShe's my private freaky deak, my own personal skeez\nWouldn't leave her for nothin, only a crazy man would\nThat's why I had to tell ya that (I - feel - good)\n\n[Chorus]\n(I feel good) about Kanday"}}, {"title": "Mr. Goodbar", "album": "Mama Said Knock You Out", "year": "1990-08-28", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nNah y'all nah y'all uh-uh\nI ain't

cereal\n(Baby)\nMilky cereal\n\n[Verse 1]\nMirror, mirror on the wall\nWho's the baddest female of them all?\nIt was Frosted Flake, she loved to bowl\nAnd although her skin was white she had a lot of soul\nRich female, very debonnaire\nDrivin' a Rolls with rollers in her hair\nWe was hangin' out, pumpin' the stereo\nShe took me to a club, I think the name was Cheerio's\nShe walked like she was jumpin' a hurdle\nI was happy as a kid that just saw _Mutant Ninja Turtles_\nA guy walked over, said, \"Your earring's cute\"\nI said, \"I'm wearin' a earring, but it ain't no Fruit Loop\"\nMe and Frosted went to get a drink\nBut she ordered somethin' bugged and I ain't know what to think\nShe ordered potassium, calcium\nCarbohydrate scotch with sodium\nShe took me to her crib, threw me on the couch\nI woke up the next morning with a spoon in my mouth\nShe's\n\n[Chorus]\nMilky cereal\n(Baby)\nMilky cereal\nMilky cereal\n(Baby)\nMilky cereal\nMilky cereal\n(Baby)\nMilky cereal\nMilky cereal\n(Baby)\nMilky cereal\n\n[Vesre 2]\nI went to Vegas, didn't think it'd do any harm\nI walked into this girl named Lucky Charm\nFor some reason we walked in the rain\nShe had a four-leaf clover with a big gold chain\nShe had a salary that was full of calories, for real\nAnd I was in the mood for a homecooked meal\nSo we went to be alone\nBut we had to be quiet, cause her Corn Pops was home\nKissed her neck, kissed her back, kissed her arms\nI said, \"Forget it, let me see your Lucky Charms\"\nWhen we began her hairstyle was neat\nBut when I left the next morning it looked like Shredded Wheat\nTalked about marriage, I said, \"That's risky\nBesides, it's such a waste of Rice Krispies\"\nShe had a robe with the velours material\nHer pops woke up, I said, \"Hello Mr. Cereal\nI came this morning to deliver the paper\"\nHe said, \"Stop frontin', I know you caught the vapors\nThat's my daughter, so save your croonin\nYou better find another bowl of cereal to stick your spoon in\"\n\n[Chorus]\nMilky cereal\n(Baby)\nMilky cereal\nMilky cereal\n(Baby)\nMilky cereal\nMilky cereal\n(Baby)\nMilky cereal\nMilky cereal\n(Baby)\nMilky cereal\nYeah, check this out here:\n\n[Verse 3]\nThen there was Pebbles, times was rough\nShe was turnin' tricks to get her \"coo-coo puff!\"\nHer mind was gone, but she turned me on, in fact\nShe was wearin' an Apple Jack hat\nWith a full-link fox and some pink bobby-socks\nHer father had a greedy disease, fried chicken pox\nWe called him Hungry Jack\nHe talked like pops, and then he dressed like The Mack\nHe invited me out to lunch\nWith a old army buddy of his, Captain Crunch\nThe waiter said, \"Jack, what would you like today?\"\nHe said, \"I don't know, just make it Special, 'K?\"\nHe said, \"Cool,\" came back with the order\nThat's when I said, \"Hey yo, Jack, I like your daughter\"\nHe said, \"Pebbles? Boy, are you crazy?\nI said, \"Nah, I wanna ride in a Mercedes\nShe could sing while I'm swingin' my thing\nCause her burgers taste better than Burger King\"\nHe said, \"Go party? Do some minglin'?\nYou and my daughter? Your brain must be jinglin!\"\nI said, \"It's smooth, no disrespect\nShe'll sign a pre-nup, so she don't get half of my week check\"\nThen we walked down the aisle\nOur honeymoon was milky - cereal style\nYou know what I'm sayin'?\n\n[Chorus]\nMilky cereal\n(Baby)\nMilky cereal\nMilky cereal\n(Baby)\nMilky cereal\nMilky cereal\n(Baby)\nMilky cereal\nMilky cereal\n(Baby)\nMilky cereal\nMilky\n\n[Outro]\nHa-ha-ha\nPeace!"}}, {"title": "The Bristol Hotel", "album": "Bigger and Deffer", "year": "1987-05-29", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI know a fat girl, she wears a orange skirt\nYou give her twenty dollars and you can do work\nShe'll take food stamps and a traveler's cheque\nBecause her hair and her face and her life's a wreck\nShe wears a bright blonde wig, some high heeled pumps\nShe's down in the dumps so she's sellin' her rump\nShe's a hot little momma and she works every day\nIf you wanna pay to play, here's where she stays\nShe's at the...\n\n[Chorus]\n(Bristol Hotel) Room 515\n(The Bristol Hotel) Where that at?

Ya peep that?\nI'm on a mission to rejuvenate the funk\nBring the game back and give the do-or-diers what they want\nWhen you hear Craig Mack, Notorious B.I.G\nLatifah, Heavy D, you should reminisce of me\nSome say it's Naughty By Nature, \"Hip-hop in all its glory\"\nA fleet of battleships floatin' in different categories\nMy love affair with hip-hop'll never fade away\nSincerely yours, LL Cool J\nPeace\n\n[Chorus]\nWhenever and ever\nWe want you, I need you (I need hip-hop)\nWhenever and ever\nWe want you, do you feel the same way too? (I need hip-hop)\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, ain't no doubt about it kid, know I'm sayin'?\nHip-hop's the game, helped a lot of brothers escape\nTake it to another level, know I'm sayin'?\nIt's our music, we own this music, know what I'm sayin'?\nWord life! I wanna give a couple of shout outs here, know what I'm saying?\nFirst of all, I wanna thank my man Baby Chris, y'nahmean?\nHelped me put this Mr. Smith, Mr.Smith album together\nMake it hot, know I'm sayin'?\nThank the Trackmasters-Poke & Tone, Steve Stoute\nWe definitely turning this joint out, y'nahmean\nWord bond! Hip-hop for life, kid!\nYeah!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/aba57f7703e47dacfcd5243398922d01.500x500x1.jpg", "artist": "LL Cool J", "raw": {"annotation_count": 17, "api_path": "/songs/29052", "apple_music_id": "1341322048", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/29052/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "In this song, LL Cool J pays homage to all the MC\u2019s who inspired him to rap, and shout outs the new rappers coming out that he respects.\n\nThe song samples \u201cTell Me If You Still Care\u201d by The S.O.S.

5]\nComputerize, then the engineer's eyes\nHave to be very acute, education level high\nThe product is mine, beat under rhyme\nThe control board's part of the studio design\nTrack after track, culminating on wax\nThe tape has slack, rewind spins back\nExpensive but useful, the music is the fuel\nA perfect place for MCs to duel (duel, duel, duel)\n\n[Outro]\nI need a beat\nFarmer's

your man had beef\nSo he left you Uptown, teary-eyed, on the back streets\nFor me to scoop up in the Bentley drop\nLong as God hold me down you know I had to stop\nWhat the deal ma?  You wanna use my cell?\nYou runnin' solo?  This block foul as hell\nYou said my ex be beatin' on me\nHe mad jealous even though he be cheatin' on me\nMmm, I said miss, let me tell you somethin'\n'Bout who's makin' major moves and who's frontin'\nHuh, who's talkin' loud but ain't sayin' nothin'\nAnd those who get the one they want but keep frontin\nHe don't appreciate the well 'til it run dry\nLove is blind, it's hard to say goodbye {goodbye}\nBut smart birds choose to fly\n'Cause we livin' in the hood girlfriend, it's do or die\nHere's my definition, of love everlasting\nI would trade all my cash in, for passion\nTiffany jewels and designer fashions\nTo hear happiness is mine for the askin'\nEvery day on my knees I pray\nThat I would run into someone that make me feel this way\nWhat you think, you wanna ride with L?\nSome things are meant to be baby, you never can tell\n(I wanna ride, with you baby)\n\n[Chorus: Kelly Price]\nEvery night, every day\nI just sit and dream about you\nYou and me, you and me\nHold me tight, ecstasy\nMakin love 'til ever after\nBaby, you and me, yeah, you and me\n\n[Verse 2: LL Cool J]\nNow we dippin' on the FDR\nIt's one of them lucky nights when you can peep out the stars\nWe speak without talkin' and the world is ours\nWhen I glance over at ya I can feel your power\nYou schemin', L want a one-night stand\nI'm schemin', she probably in love with her man\nBut we keep on rollin', hopin' there's somethin' more\nDreamin' about tomorrow and what life got in store\nLivin, no drama, we can chill, relax\nSex all night in the morn' count stacks\nSip Grand Marnier and maybe puff a dime sack\nBut only in moderation, we ain't livin' like that, y'know?\nWe jetted up the tavern on the green\nTo talk about love cause the game's extreme\nDomestic abuse and everything in between\n'Cause I want you to think of me\nWhen you need a shoulder to lean on\nI'm from Queens, I'ma rep to the fullest\nBut I'd rather chill with you, 'stead of dodgin' bullets\nGlock in the stash I don't really wanna pull it\nOn some so-called thug cat, that's faker than acrylics\nHe said your fam be ridin' your nerves\nAnd you hate him for never given you the life you deserve\nRemember, the one who hold a grudge is foul\nAnd everything you ever wanted is in front of you now\nWhassup?\n\n[Chorus: Kelly Price]\nEvery night, every day\nI just sit and dream about you\nYou and me, you and me\nHold me tight, ecstasy\nMakin love 'til ever after\nBaby, you and me, yeah, you and me\n\n[Verse 3: LL Cool J]\nI promise you, dreams do come true\nThere's trials and tribulations that we all go through\nWhen your heart's bleedin', how could the sky seem blue?\nBut listen up shorty, this is what I wanna do\nBe there for you, baby care for you\nWhen my dogs stare at you never sharin' you\nAnd to my ex-girlfriend, never comparin' you\nAnd do the things that your ex never dared to do\nTime to bounce baby, I'm takin' you home\nLook at the moonlight sparkle on the 20 inch chrome\nThe rocks on my hand got a life of they own\nPlus the blend tape's bumpin' and it's settin' the tone\nShould I jet to the hotel, is now the right time\nOr should I be patient and explore your mind?\nYou said you grew up in the ghetto and it hurt your heart\nTried to live smart but your dreams fell apart\nYou dated hustlers and brought 'em customers\nThey totally destroyed whatever trust there was\nNow you hate men and everything they stand for\n'Cause you wanna be treated like a queen, not a whore\nClose your eyes, don't be afraid to dream\nOpen your heart to this cat from Queens\nWhatever you wanna do, however you wanna do it\nBack to back baby, we can get each other through it\n\n[Chorus: Kelly Price]\nEvery night, every day\nI just sit and dream about you\nYou and me, you and me\nHold me tight, ecstasy\nMakin love 'til ever after\nBaby, you and me, yeah, you and me\nEvery night, every day\nI just sit and dream about you\nYou and me, you and me\nHold me tight, ecstasy\nMakin love 'til ever after\nBaby, you and me, yeah, you and me\nEvery night, every day\nI just sit and dream about you\nYou and me, you and me\nHold me tight, ecstasy\nMakin love 'til ever after\nBaby, you and me, yeah, you and me\n\n[Outro: LL Cool J]\nKnahmean?  Word up\nYeah, yeah\nC'mon, c'mon\nC'mon, c'mon\nYeah, I just want you to think about that, y'knahmsayin?\nLate at night when you layin there\nAnd you feel like the whole world is fallin' around you\nRemember these words that I said\nThere's somebody out there for you baby\nMight be me, you never know, ahahah\nWord up, stay strong shorty\nKeep your eyes up to the sky, knahmsayin'?\nDon't let nobody tell you you can't make it\nAnd don't let nobody around you tell you\nThat it ain't possible to make your dreams come true\nWord up, uhh\nKnahmean?

finished\nAnd Father Time was the blame\nYou disrespected my legacy\nAnd threw dirt on my name\nTold DJs he's over\nHe ain't spittin' the same\nWhat he says is irrelevant\nHip-Hop culture has changed\nWhen I walk in the room\nYoung boys look at me strange\nAs if I am a relic\nFrom some long forgotten game\nIt makes my blood boil\nTurns my eyes to flames\nI built an empire\nThey tried to kick me out in the rain\nSo I called on an inner power\nIt's hard to explain\nIt's like a holy spirit\nUtilizing Hip-Hop slang\nI'm beyond the gold grills\nAnd logos on chains\nYou see I changed rap forever\nI elevated the game\nLaunched the greatest label\nIn the history of rap\nAnd for 24 years\nI carried it on my back\nI've always shined brighter\nWhen I'm under attack\nI might be down for a moment\nBut I always come back\n\n[Hook]\nIt's time for war\nIt's time for war\nIt's time for war\nIt's time for war (Uh, yeah)\nIt's time for war\nIt's time for war\nIt's time for war\nIt's time for war (Check it)\nIt's time for war\n\n[Verse 2]\nThis is a resurrection\nI'm back from the dead\nThey told me quit a long time ago\nBut I conquered instead\nI had dreams and visions\nSwirling around in my head\nI had this hunger deep inside of me\nThat has to be fed\nHip-Hop will respect\nAll the blood that I shed\nI have a covenant with God\nI have swallowed the bread\nHip-Hop my co-defendant\nWith this mic I thee wed\nI made an entire generation\nObey what we said\nI'm talkin' France to Germany\nFrom Italy to Japan\nFrom London to Belgium\nTo Afghanistan\nFrom Farmers Boulevard\nSmokin' a blunt with my man\nTo writin' rhymes on a ironing board\nTo build Def Jam\nYou see, I'm the undisputed\nKing of all Hip-Hop\nEverything after is my legacy\nLike it or not\nAnd I will keep making history\nI can't stop\nLL Cool J\nEternally hot\n\n[Hook]\nIt's time for war\nIt's time for war\nIt's time for war\nIt's time for war\nIt's time for war\nIt's time for war\nIt's time for war\nIt's time for war\nIt's time for war\n\n[Verse 3]\nLook at how easily I flipped it\nAnd switched the style around\nCompetition losin' their footing\nI see them falling down\nThey will plot against me\nIt kills them because I'm ballin' now\nSome of y'all didn't pick up the phone\nBut I got you callin' now\nThis is a job that must get done\nEven if I become public enemy number one\nIf I had to pick up an Uzi\nThat weighs over a ton\nI will attack Hip-Hop\nUntil competition is none\nNobody on God's earth wants it with L\nYou end up tortured\nAnd trapped in psychological hell\nAnd this is the beginning\nOf a new era in rap\nLL Cool J, feel the impact\nIt's okay if you call it a comeback\nAnd let them know\nI'm ready for combat\nTell those dumb motherfuckers to fall back\nThe crown looks wrong on your head\nI

Cool J\nServin em well\nAnd as you all know..\nI AM - HARD - AS HELL\n\nWoke up at 9:30 on a Saturday morn'\nHemmed my remote control, turned my stereo on\nThen I reached for a brush since I don't use the picks\nAnd the floor was kinda cold, so I put on my kicks\nWalked to the kitchen and ate some cornflakes\nAs I bop to a tape of Cut Creator's breaks\nWith hardcore - heavyweight - b-boy blast\nConnoisseur of hardcore, and Cut Creator's fast\nJumped in the shower, it was boiling hot\nSo I stayed there a hour, cause I like it a lot\nJumped out, dried off, put on the Devin cologne\nThen I called up Earl on the telephone\nHe told me 'bout a jam that I could do later on\n10 g's plus a limo for one strong song\nSo I said, yeah, I was with it, hung up and got geared\nGot a magnfying glass, then I brushed my beard\nRewound some tapes of some Def Jam tunes\nAs I waited for this freak to ring my bell at noon\n12 o'clock came, left the door crack\nThe freak walked in, a mink on her back\nPut her coat on the rack, threw my [sess robe?] on\nThen I threw in a tape of the quiet storm\nWe drank Round Hill Cabernet Sauvignon\nShe said, \"L.L., when you're gonna let me taste your tongue?\"\nMy skin got pale, I wam-bammed the tail\nDid it so hard I shoulda went to jail\nShe left, Earl came over and we went outside\nJumped in the BM to bust a joyride\nWent up to A.J., in my fresh black wheel\nI'm not a sucker on the corner tryin to scrape up a meal\nThe girlies want sex, the fellas try to plex\nBut those who flex end up with broke necks\nSigned some autographs for a posse of freaks\nSaid, \"It's L, baby, I ain't down with Chic\"\nConversated with the skeezers for 10 minutes more\nThen I jumped in my ride and the freaks slammed the door\nDue cause I'm a gangster people think I do crimes\nThey don't know I'm just a connoisseur of hip-hop rhymes\nSome smile, try to call L.L. a hoodlum at times\nBut he don't know my autograph's on his wife's behind\nL.L. has iced all the washed up slobs\nVigilante of rap, so to hell with the mob\nDon't run from the cops, makin suckers jock\nAnd I'm only 18 makin more than your pops\nTormentor of toys and boyscout boys\nAnd I dare any critic to call it noise\nPeeped at the clock, it said 6:03\nSaid 'later' to Creator and broke out with E\nWent up to White Castle for a chocolate shake\nThinkin 'bout a 100,000 that I'd soon make\nFinished up the snack, jumped up, out my seat\nE-Love hit the table and he made up a beat\nKicked a few lines, stepped out the door\nSaid \"Tonight is a bore, I'm in the mood for more\"\nWe jumped in my ride, I took a peek at the time\nIt was almost 7:30 and the show was at nine\nL.L. Cool J will soon stand at a jam\nWith thousands of people screamin, \"Touch my hand!\"\nBut since I had a hour plus a half attached\nI was searchin for the cutie who's my perfect match\nHer name was Renee, her face was okay\nBut she had the kinda body that made Jay wanna play\nI said, \"No need to rehearse,\" then I made my approach\nSaid, \"You got a good team, girl, but you need a new coach\"\nSaid, \"My name's L.L. - Cool, if I may introduce\nBut I'm not here for conversation, I'm here to seduce\nWanna mix it up, baby, wanna feel you grind\nCause it ain't 5th grade, and these ain't nursery rhymes\nAnd I know that you adore my sure side hardcore\nCheck out the real L.L. behind closed doors\nSo tell your buddies you're busy, tell your boyfriend beat it\nForget the silk dress,cause you ain't gonna need it\nUnplug your clock, do away with the light\nAfter five minutes or more you hear me say, 'That's right!'\nYour body is bad and I heard you got a Caddy\nWhen we make love you can call me daddy\nI'm L.L. Cool J, say hey, Renee\nI'm not a toyboy, but I still wanna play\nPromise you I'm not wack when I'm in the sack\nAfter that I leave you starvin for me to come back\nBut in the meantime, put your digits down\nAnd the next time I see ya I'm goin to town\"\nStepped away from the freak, it was a quarter to nine\nWhen I rolled to the jam I saw the crew on line\nTook a trip around the side, so I could get backstage\nIf you call me a tiger, then the stage is my cage\nI rip, stomp and crush, heavy metal bands rust\nThem flaky knuckleheads I crumble up like crust\nWalked in my dressing room, and then I heard four knocks\nThey said, \"L.L., you're runnin late and it'is time to rock\"\nTold Cut Creator what the order would be\nThen I said \"Lord have mercy\" and slapped hands with E\nWent onstage, I heard the girlies scream\nAnd that's the very moment I woke up from the dream\nAahh!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/360d16b8aeb2fd205516a7b8c96f11b2.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "LL

Cool J\nServin em well\nAnd as you all know..\nI AM - HARD - AS HELL\n\nWoke up at 9:30 on a Saturday morn'\nHemmed my remote control, turned my stereo on\nThen I reached for a brush since I don't use the picks\nAnd the floor was kinda cold, so I put on my kicks\nWalked to the kitchen and ate some cornflakes\nAs I bop to a tape of Cut Creator's breaks\nWith hardcore - heavyweight - b-boy blast\nConnoisseur of hardcore, and Cut Creator's fast\nJumped in the shower, it was boiling hot\nSo I stayed there a hour, cause I like it a lot\nJumped out, dried off, put on the Devin cologne\nThen I called up Earl on the telephone\nHe told me 'bout a jam that I could do later on\n10 g's plus a limo for one strong song\nSo I said, yeah, I was with it, hung up and got geared\nGot a magnfying glass, then I brushed my beard\nRewound some tapes of some Def Jam tunes\nAs I waited for this freak to ring my bell at noon\n12 o'clock came, left the door crack\nThe freak walked in, a mink on her back\nPut her coat on the rack, threw my [sess robe?] on\nThen I threw in a tape of the quiet storm\nWe drank Round Hill Cabernet Sauvignon\nShe said, \"L.L., when you're gonna let me taste your tongue?\"\nMy skin got pale, I wam-bammed the tail\nDid it so hard I shoulda went to jail\nShe left, Earl came over and we went outside\nJumped in the BM to bust a joyride\nWent up to A.J., in my fresh black wheel\nI'm not a sucker on the corner tryin to scrape up a meal\nThe girlies want sex, the fellas try to plex\nBut those who flex end up with broke necks\nSigned some autographs for a posse of freaks\nSaid, \"It's L, baby, I ain't down with Chic\"\nConversated with the skeezers for 10 minutes more\nThen I jumped in my ride and the freaks slammed the door\nDue cause I'm a gangster people think I do crimes\nThey don't know I'm just a connoisseur of hip-hop rhymes\nSome smile, try to call L.L. a hoodlum at times\nBut he don't know my autograph's on his wife's behind\nL.L. has iced all the washed up slobs\nVigilante of rap, so to hell with the mob\nDon't run from the cops, makin suckers jock\nAnd I'm only 18 makin more than your pops\nTormentor of toys and boyscout boys\nAnd I dare any critic to call it noise\nPeeped at the clock, it said 6:03\nSaid 'later' to Creator and broke out with E\nWent up to White Castle for a chocolate shake\nThinkin 'bout a 100,000 that I'd soon make\nFinished up the snack, jumped up, out my seat\nE-Love hit the table and he made up a beat\nKicked a few lines, stepped out the door\nSaid \"Tonight is a bore, I'm in the mood for more\"\nWe jumped in my ride, I took a peek at the time\nIt was almost 7:30 and the show was at nine\nL.L. Cool J will soon stand at a jam\nWith thousands of people screamin, \"Touch my hand!\"\nBut since I had a hour plus a half attached\nI was searchin for the cutie who's my perfect match\nHer name was Renee, her face was okay\nBut she had the kinda body that made Jay wanna play\nI said, \"No need to rehearse,\" then I made my approach\nSaid, \"You got a good team, girl, but you need a new coach\"\nSaid, \"My name's L.L. - Cool, if I may introduce\nBut I'm not here for conversation, I'm here to seduce\nWanna mix it up, baby, wanna feel you grind\nCause it ain't 5th grade, and these ain't nursery rhymes\nAnd I know that you adore my sure side hardcore\nCheck out the real L.L. behind closed doors\nSo tell your buddies you're busy, tell your boyfriend beat it\nForget the silk dress,cause you ain't gonna need it\nUnplug your clock, do away with the light\nAfter five minutes or more you hear me say, 'That's right!'\nYour body is bad and I heard you got a Caddy\nWhen we make love you can call me daddy\nI'm L.L. Cool J, say hey, Renee\nI'm not a toyboy, but I still wanna play\nPromise you I'm not wack when I'm in the sack\nAfter that I leave you starvin for me to come back\nBut in the meantime, put your digits down\nAnd the next time I see ya I'm goin to town\"\nStepped away from the freak, it was a quarter to nine\nWhen I rolled to the jam I saw the crew on line\nTook a trip around the side, so I could get backstage\nIf you call me a tiger, then the stage is my cage\nI rip, stomp and crush, heavy metal bands rust\nThem flaky knuckleheads I crumble up like crust\nWalked in my dressing room, and then I heard four knocks\nThey said, \"L.L., you're runnin late and it'is time to rock\"\nTold Cut Creator what the order would be\nThen I said \"Lord have mercy\" and slapped hands with E\nWent onstage, I heard the girlies scream\nAnd that's the very moment I woke up from the dream\nAahh!"}}, {"title": "Give Me Love", "album": "Authentic", "year": "2013-04-30", "lyrics": "[Bridge: Seal]\nGive me love\nI swear all I need is your heart (your heart)\nUh baby\nGive me love\nTell me where you need me to stop\nI swear all I need is your love\n\n[Verse 1: LL Cool J]\nHonestly, I'm afraid to give love\nDeep down I'm afraid to be judged\nThat's why I pull back, don't speak no rap\nPut on the beat, man every time we hug\nIt's deep, I'm afraid of heartbreak so much\nThe thought alone feels like my soul got cut\nMy heart's wide open, baby show me mercy\nLife is a desert and for love I'm thirsty\nYou lead me to the water, I'm afraid to drink\nYou hand me a glass, still don't know what to think\nYour love is terrifying, I'm standing on the brink\nI'm floating in your eyes then I start to sink\nGirl, I never knew that I could feel so weak\nFlying on a cloud in-between these sheets\nI'm one with myself, why do I retreat?\nIt's a battle just to try to go to sleep\n\n[Bridge: Seal]\nGive me love\nI swear all I need is your heart (that's alright)\nUh baby\nGive me love\nTell me when you need me to stop\nI swear all I need is your love\n\n[Chorus: Seal & LL Cool J]\nGive it to me baby (you baby)\nGive it to me baby (you baby)\nGive it to me baby (yea)\nGive it to me\nJust give me your heart\nGive it to me baby\nUh baby\nGive it to me baby\nUh girl\nGive it to me baby\nI swear all I need is your love\n\n[Verse 2: LL Cool J]\nEverybody knows that falling in love's easy, timing out's hard\nSo the only one who really knows my thoughts is God\nIt's crazy, I hold you in the highest regard\nBut us having true love? What's the odds?\nThat's scary, what if I get hit that hard\nSo hard I can't get up, heart got lit up\nToo weak to move, can't eat, won't sit up\nMommy used to say \u2013 don't worry, it's just a hiccup\nBut even she can't help\nWhen your heart's on fire and about to melt\nSo everything I really feel, I keep it to myself\nSo I don't end up hurt like everybody else\nTook love off the bat, burn

J]\nHonestly, I'm afraid to give love\nDeep down I'm afraid to be judged\nThat's why I pull back, don't speak no rap\nPut on the beat, man every time we hug\nIt's deep, I'm afraid of heartbreak so much\nThe thought alone feels like my soul got cut\nMy heart's wide open, baby show me mercy\nLife is a desert and for love I'm thirsty\nYou lead me to the water, I'm afraid to drink\nYou hand me a glass, still don't know what to think\nYour love is terrifying, I'm standing on the brink\nI'm floating in your eyes then I start to sink\nGirl, I never knew that I could feel so weak\nFlying on a cloud in-between these sheets\nI'm one with myself, why do I retreat?\nIt's a battle just to try to go to sleep\n\n[Bridge: Seal]\nGive me love\nI swear all I need is your heart (that's alright)\nUh baby\nGive me love\nTell me when you need me to stop\nI swear all I need is your love\n\n[Chorus: Seal & LL Cool J]\nGive it to me baby (you baby)\nGive it to me baby (you baby)\nGive it to me baby (yea)\nGive it to me\nJust give me your heart\nGive it to me baby\nUh baby\nGive it to me baby\nUh girl\nGive it to me baby\nI swear all I need is your love\n\n[Verse 2: LL Cool J]\nEverybody knows that falling in love's easy, timing out's hard\nSo the only one who really knows my thoughts is God\nIt's crazy, I hold you in the highest regard\nBut us having true love? What's the odds?\nThat's scary, what if I get hit that hard\nSo hard I can't get up, heart got lit up\nToo weak to move, can't eat, won't sit up\nMommy used to say \u2013 don't worry, it's just a hiccup\nBut even she can't help\nWhen your heart's on fire and about to melt\nSo everything I really feel, I keep it to myself\nSo I don't end up hurt like everybody else\nTook love off the bat, burn I put it on the shelf\nWith the books I never read about pain I never felt\nLove is a problem, baby I need help\nMy card's on the table and my heart's breaking me up\n\n[Bridge: Seal]\nGive me love\nI swear all I need is your heart (I swear)\nUh baby\nGive me love\nTell me when you need me to stop\nI swear all I need is your love\n\n[Chorus: Seal & LL Cool J]\nGive it to me baby (you baby)\nGive it to me baby (from you baby)\nGive it to me baby (yea)\nGive it to me\nJust give me your heart\nGive it to me baby\nUh baby\nGive it to me baby\nUh girl\nGive it to me baby\nI swear all I need is your love\n\n[Bridge: LL Cool J]\nIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times\nWhen the last chapter's done, I hope you're mine\nYea\n(I need you to know)\nIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times\nWhen the last chapter's done, I hope you're mine\nBut until that try\n\n[Bridge: Seal]\nGive me love\nI swear all I need is your heart (that's all I need)\nUh baby (Uh baby)\nGive me love (oh love)\nTell me when you need me to stop\nI swear all I need is your love\n\nGive it to me baby (your love)\nGive it to me baby (just what I need)\nGive it to me baby (your love is just what I need)\nGive it to me baby\nGive it to me baby (your love, your love, your love)\nGive it to me baby\nGive it to me baby (that's what I need)\nAll I need is your love\n\nDear diary (dear diary)\nI hope she feels the same\nI hope she keeps loving me\nKeeps loving me as I'm loving her\nAll I'm learning is to love her\nI pray our love won't change\nIt's kinda hard\nGive me love"}}, {"title": "Eat Em Up L Chill", "album": "Mama Said Knock You Out", "year": "1990-08-28", "lyrics": "[Chorus]\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\n\n[Verse 1]\nBring on the mo's and ho's\nDon't snooze or doze\n'Cause I'm rippin' up shows\nHold your nose, dead bodies are around\nI leave scratch marks under the tears of a clown\nI write rhymes that shine like lipstick\nSo much material, but not materialistic\nImperial styles I use\nWhen the mic is lifted the crowd is amused\nCome with it, if you feel you're full-fledged\nOr yell \"Geronimo!\" and jump off the edge\nYour e-n-d is near when I appear\nThe stage is yours, but wait until the smoke clears\nRhyme sayer, and I'm here to lay a load\nSo watch a player when he's playin' in player mode\nUncle L's bad, and you're soon to say\n'Cause I rip the mic until the toon decay\n\n[Chorus]\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\n\n[Verse 2]\nMC's are dumb, I catch em in a dragnet\nYou're not complete, I'm battlin' a fragment\nSo creative and witty and outstandin'\nAnd I be demandin' that you're abandoned\nIn the desert or a wild west town\nWhile I'm at your crib on a cherry-go-round\nWhere will she stop? No one knows\nLike I said before, bring on the mo's and ho's\nI know my abc's and my p's and q's\nJust chill and listen to the rhyme cruise\nAll aboard, the cod is a reward\nSome were ignored when they toured for they bored\nThe crowd was aloud, lyrics weren't endowed\nTook a crack of the 40 and went to show 'em how\nYou like me now, but you didn't before\n'Cause you forgot I was raw\n\n[Chorus]\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\n\n[Interlude]\nAh\nFuture of the funk, ah\n(Go 'head, baby)\n(Do it)\nGo 'head, baby\n(Do it)\nYeah\n(Do it)\n\n[Chorus]\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Yo, eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\n\n[Verse 3]\nIt's so visual the way I'm throwin' down\nVisualize MC's goin' down\nIn a barrage of bullets combinated with rhymes\nThe moral of the story is: I'ma get mines\nI saw the cord-less, boy, I'm gonna house that\nYour rhymes are cheesy, you found 'em in a mouse trap\nDon't try to front while the freestyle's droppin'\nHe wants to battle, he must be needle-poppin'\nYou better notify your next of kin\n'Cause when I begin it's like a needle to the skin\nIf you wasn't prepared\nThen you ought to be scared\nBut even if you was\nYou're aware what the rhyme does\nI remember when you was an amateur\nWritin' your rhymes, starin' at my signature\nBought the album, analyzed the style\nTisk-tisk (Hatchew!)

L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\n\n[Verse 1]\nBring on the mo's and ho's\nDon't snooze or doze\n'Cause I'm rippin' up shows\nHold your nose, dead bodies are around\nI leave scratch marks under the tears of a clown\nI write rhymes that shine like lipstick\nSo much material, but not materialistic\nImperial styles I use\nWhen the mic is lifted the crowd is amused\nCome with it, if you feel you're full-fledged\nOr yell \"Geronimo!\" and jump off the edge\nYour e-n-d is near when I appear\nThe stage is yours, but wait until the smoke clears\nRhyme sayer, and I'm here to lay a load\nSo watch a player when he's playin' in player mode\nUncle L's bad, and you're soon to say\n'Cause I rip the mic until the toon decay\n\n[Chorus]\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\n\n[Verse 2]\nMC's are dumb, I catch em in a dragnet\nYou're not complete, I'm battlin' a fragment\nSo creative and witty and outstandin'\nAnd I be demandin' that you're abandoned\nIn the desert or a wild west town\nWhile I'm at your crib on a cherry-go-round\nWhere will she stop? No one knows\nLike I said before, bring on the mo's and ho's\nI know my abc's and my p's and q's\nJust chill and listen to the rhyme cruise\nAll aboard, the cod is a reward\nSome were ignored when they toured for they bored\nThe crowd was aloud, lyrics weren't endowed\nTook a crack of the 40 and went to show 'em how\nYou like me now, but you didn't before\n'Cause you forgot I was raw\n\n[Chorus]\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\n\n[Interlude]\nAh\nFuture of the funk, ah\n(Go 'head, baby)\n(Do it)\nGo 'head, baby\n(Do it)\nYeah\n(Do it)\n\n[Chorus]\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Yo, eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\n\n[Verse 3]\nIt's so visual the way I'm throwin' down\nVisualize MC's goin' down\nIn a barrage of bullets combinated with rhymes\nThe moral of the story is: I'ma get mines\nI saw the cord-less, boy, I'm gonna house that\nYour rhymes are cheesy, you found 'em in a mouse trap\nDon't try to front while the freestyle's droppin'\nHe wants to battle, he must be needle-poppin'\nYou better notify your next of kin\n'Cause when I begin it's like a needle to the skin\nIf you wasn't prepared\nThen you ought to be scared\nBut even if you was\nYou're aware what the rhyme does\nI remember when you was an amateur\nWritin' your rhymes, starin' at my signature\nBought the album, analyzed the style\nTisk-tisk (Hatchew!) God bless you, child\nI'm unique when I speak to a beat\nAnother rapper'll fall when the mission's complete\nI daze and amaze, my display's a faze\nEvery phrase is a maze as Uncle L slays\nThe competition that's lost in a freestyle\n'Cause on the mic I'm the golden child\nWith the magical wand that they're callin' a mic\nAnd when MC's approach it turns into a spike\n\n[Chorus]\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nWhy don't you just chill?\n(Eat 'em up, L)\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, yeah\nI wanna say what's up to my man Kool Herc\nAnd my man Afrika Bambaataa and the Zulu Nation\nKnow what what I'm sayin'\nMy man Marley Marl and DJ Clash\nMy man B-Blast\nRush Town\nDef Jam\nWe in the house\nOf course I gotta say what's up to my homeboys EPMD\nYeah\nI get busy\nPeace"}}, {"title": "The G.O.A.T.", "album": "G.O.A.T.

So I figured yknowhatI'msayin\nI'd just make a little movie, witcha chick involved\nHehe, y'dig? Check it\n\n[Verse 1]\nIf you saw the movie Wall Street I guess you know\nThe way I stack chips and regulate wild dough\nBut ain't no G-Funk and far from my era\nTales in the hood your boys'll feel terror\nMCs contaminating tracks with feces\nYou think I'm pussy until I flip like Species\nHigh-tech, yep, my pen got velocity\nJumping out the SSL like Virtuosity\nAnd never question what I'm doing to your girl\nShe let me dive deep like her panties is Waterworld\nBut are metaphors the only thing in rap?\nYou brothers need to stop with that\nI'm going from\n\n[Chorus]\nHollis to Hollywood, but is he good?\n(See how it sounds?

Let's run it back\nSee the flavor's in my lifestyle, chill don't even lie to me\nBalls are lethal weapons, dick a menace to society\nYou ain't a player hater kid you took her off restriction\nI make her tell lies and knock the pulp out of fiction\nKid you know I'm game tight\nWhen you hit it tonight I hope she scream my name right\nThat's word is bond kid, you know why?\nI'm going from\n\n[Chorus]\nHollis to Hollywood, but is he good?\n(See how it sounds?

freak\nSome kind of metaphorical freak or somethin' man\nYknahmsayin, word up, so, yknowhatI'msayin\nYou know brother's wanna make a movie and all that\nYknahmean? So I figured yknowhatI'msayin\nI'd just make a little movie, witcha chick involved\nHehe, y'dig? Check it\n\n[Verse 1]\nIf you saw the movie Wall Street I guess you know\nThe way I stack chips and regulate wild dough\nBut ain't no G-Funk and far from my era\nTales in the hood your boys'll feel terror\nMCs contaminating tracks with feces\nYou think I'm pussy until I flip like Species\nHigh-tech, yep, my pen got velocity\nJumping out the SSL like Virtuosity\nAnd never question what I'm doing to your girl\nShe let me dive deep like her panties is Waterworld\nBut are metaphors the only thing in rap?\nYou brothers need to stop with that\nI'm going from\n\n[Chorus]\nHollis to Hollywood, but is he good?\n(See how it sounds? A little unrational)\n(Broken down to his very last compound)\nHollis to Hollywood, but is he good?\n(See how it sounds? A little unrational)\n(Broken down to his very last compound)\nHollis to Hollywood, but is he good?\n(See how it sounds? A little unrational)\n(Broken down to his very last compound)\nHollis to Hollywood, but is he good?\n(See how it sounds? A little unrational)\n(Broken down to his very last compound)\n\n[Verse 2]\nCheck it\nI'll make the speed like I'm Keanu Reeves\nBut too many true lies can make a honey bleed\nShe said, I know you want this, ghetto Pocahontas\nI got higher learning and banging gets monotonous\nHer ass was classic, cheeks was Jurassic\nServing her justice, poetic the way I lasted\nI touch ground real windy with my lyrics\nMake her talk in tongue and feelash to swing\nWhen I do my thing my balls is ha the Holy Spirit\nHear it, pull it like strings, got mad ciry like The Lion King\nI'm in the jungle laying down my mack\nYou brothers need to chill with that\nI'm going from\n\n[Chorus]\nHollis to Hollywood, but is he good?\n(See how it sounds? A little unrational)\n(Broken down to his very last compound)\nHollis to Hollywood, but is he good?\n(See how it sounds? A little unrational)\n(Broken down to his very last compound)\n\n[Bridge]\n(Take me away) Uhh, you think I won't boo?\n(Take me away) Uhh, you think I can't boo?\n(Take me away) Uhh, you think I won't boo?\n(Take me away) Uhh, you think I can't boo?\nIt's kinda like miniature satellites floating in closets\nSpying in pockets\nJumping out of a helicopter into a football stadium filled with cotton candy\nWheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!\nYknahmean? Worrrrd up!\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo your man got a good job loving you so much\nBoss on his back coming home like, \"What the fuck?\"\nBut you be on his side through the thick and all the thin\nThat's when LL come in\nBlast her ass like Apollo 13, sugar dipped in cream\nPopping Dom in every direction, what a scene\nHe can't understand your best friend's plan\nRunning game while you chill with the demolition man\nGood love, mad fun, tight hugs and flowers\nI have your girl running off to fake baby showers\nBetter get down for your crown at home\nI got her standing on the bed, getting closer to the drop zone\nSome brothers won't appreciate that\nAin't it scary when you meet a real mack? Let's run it back\nSee the flavor's in my lifestyle, chill don't even lie to me\nBalls are lethal weapons, dick a menace to society\nYou ain't a player hater kid you took her off restriction\nI make her tell lies and knock the pulp out of fiction\nKid you know I'm game tight\nWhen you hit it tonight I hope she scream my name right\nThat's word is bond kid, you know why?\nI'm going from\n\n[Chorus]\nHollis to Hollywood, but is he good?\n(See how it sounds? A little unrational)\n(Broken down to his very last compound)\nHollis to Hollywood, but is he good?\n(See how it sounds? A little unrational)\n(Broken down to his very last compound)\nHollis to Hollywood, but is he good?\n(See how it sounds? A little unrational)\n(Broken down to his very last compound)\nHollis to Hollywood, but is he good?\n(See how it sounds?

"lyrics": "[Verse]\nThe big showdown, the display of skill\nI'm that type of guy so put your girl on the pill\nTake a family snapshot and kiss your wife\nCause I'm like a knife, I cause grief and strife\nAnd I'll take your life and choke you like python\nI'mma do you wrong\nAny emcee, who you wanna name?\nI'm one panther that can't be tamed\nTalking about guns, punk it don't alarm me\nGot enough cash to make a whole damn army\nI can't hold back the way that I feel\nCause when I bust a rhyme it's like you're slipping on banana peels\nYou're like fruit cake and fruit cocktails\nFirst your title now I'm taking your female\nAll of a sudden you're so proud of black\nA baseball hat, but you ain't saying jack\nThe ripper is back and you can't escape\nCause one of my records'll sell more than your whole tape\nI want beef, bring on the rookies\nI got more than just Cool J cookies\nRip, rock, crush, stomp the comp, I'm poison come and take a chomp\nI bet you your teeth'll end up around the corner kid\nDon't ask me why I did\nUncivilized damage to a nobody\nAnd I'm carrying a gun if I'm rhyming at the party\nNew York, Chicago, Detroit, LA\nI'll slay wherever you play\nD.C. or Philly, or Baltimore\nI murder the rich and maim the poor\nPerpetrating in your video, here's the real schooling\nCountry accents, who you think you're fooling?\nI play Russian Roulette not Craps\nYou're only known cause of Yo MTV raps\nAnd Rap City and B.E.T\nAnd Channel 31, but now here I come\nTo save the day and now you're getting done\nLike a hooker, don't drop the soap, crumb\nThe first sign of the battle you little fink\nIs you see blood coming out your kitchen sink\nYour mic's a baby bottle son\nSome say they ain't but I am the one\nTo slice and dice and fry and boil, to bake and serve a nerd\nI heard a word occurred to him that he could move and wouldn't get\nMoved on, like a shotgun blast\nBig mouth emcees I'll bet you none last\nCause they ain't stable or able\nAnd I boost the party like jumper cables\nSo plug me in and put me on\nArsenio Hall so I can battle 'em all\nFrom coast to coast, blind, crippled and crazy\nYou use a dictionary but you still don't phase me\nListen and weep, you sound cheap\nPreach about blackness but you represent wackness\nYou're knocking on the castle door but when you fall in the moat\nI won't see you no more\nLet's get together and diss LL\nUse his name and your records might sell\nI can't believe your band of dead maggots\nCrawling all over my name I won't have it\nYou better look in the mirror and re-think your plan\nWhy walk in quicksand?\nWhen you can stand on your own two feet\nI'm ripping emcees from Funky Drummer to Big Beat\nName the date and the arena\nYou three year old ballerina\nI can't believe that suckers try to throw down\nWhether you're new or older than Motown\nJust kick back, I don't slack attack a wacker slapper rap\nThey can't handle the format\nWhether you're suave or smooth\nRough or rugged all I need is a groove\nI display a way to slay, punk play to pay\nMr Morris has entered the buffet\nSome of y'all are sitting in bowls\nPlates of the hot buttered rolls\nBeat you with baloney, stab you with salami\nCause when I get hot I get hot like pastrami\nThen I make you wonder\nWhy you don't hear bass, but you feel the thunder\nYou get cute, I'll knock out your tooth\nWe'll be fighting from the lobby to the roof\nYou annoy me like a roach at dinner time\nYo Marley (What's up?) It's Miller Time\n(Nah man, just kick a little more)\nPass the brass knuckles let me break his jaw\nWhen I'm on the microphone I want silence\nLet KRS One stop the violence\nAin't no rivals, ain't no competition\nPunk, I'm beating you into submission\nI'm gettin busier than ever before\nNever more will I slack I'mma keep it real raw\nEat you up like a pack-jam\nVideo's more popular than Batman\nRipping you to shreds, tap you in the head\nThen leave the battle looking happy as a newlywed\nGive me a Tec-9 to spray\nSave the beef and put it on lay-away\nI'm in command your man abandons on the table fans will understand\nThen you weep about the murdergram"}}, {"title": "Imagine That", "album": "G.O.A.T.

more, some more of my vocals\nYou know sex 'em up a little bit\nYou know what I mean?\n\n[Verse 1: LL Cool J]\nYou're the honey that I see when I'm riding by\nThe one giving me a feeling that I can't deny\nYou got the Prada boots on suede hitting your thigh\nActing like my chrome twenties ain't catching your eye\nSometimes I slow down catch the ass in the mirror\nTurn the fog lights on to see the legs more clearer\nYou're turning me on, keep me standing up\nI wish that I could prove to you that I'm man enough\nI come up to your job and handcuff your boss\nThrow that nigga in the closet and turn the lights off\nThen sit you up on the copy machine\nMake copies of your kitten with my chin in between\nThen I'll take you to the window so the world can see\nBaby I'm down on my knees let your world be free\nPearl tongue, come get up on this desk with me\nMultiple orgasms is your destiny\nWet dream, ride like you're going to Queens\nLike I just gave you fifty thou and ya just turned 18\nTo hell with your boss\nLet that nigga hear you scream\nSounding like that screech on the fax machine\nThen we can take it to the ladies bathroom\nMake your mascara run till you look like a racoon\nTouch yourself baby tell me it's wet\nSqueeze tight so I'll never forget, here we go\n\n[Chorus: LeShaun (LL Cool J)]\nI'ma get you for your paper\nMake you leave you girl\n(Imagine that)\nMake you trick on me around the world\n(Imagine that)\nHave you calling me your ultimate thrill\n(Imagine that)\nI got you whipped tell your niggas to chill\nI'ma hit you in the backseat and tell you to slide\n(Imagine that)\nMe and my fold got my broads collide\n(Imagine that)\nKnocking girls off two at a time\n(Imagine that)\nDisrespect you and still make you mine (Uh-uh)\n\n[Verse 2: LL Cool J]\nUh, imagine I'm your teacher and you stayed after school\nYou've been a bad girl you broke all the rules\nForgot your homework, chewed gum in class\nAnd the only way to fix it is to give me some ass\nI got a three piece suit on sitting at my desk\nI kinda need a shave but my body smell fresh\nYou're wearing a plad skirt and long white socks\nThe vibe is thick baby, we both red hot\nI kiss your neck unbutton your blouse\nLet my fingers make circles on the edge of your mouth\nYour apple's so ripe I'm your tutor for life\nGot your beggin' me to put you on detention tonight\nYou could read the Iliad and the whole Odyssey\nBut no Trojan soldier scold you like me\nMatch the calculus then measure my frequency\nBut when you blast on my lap that's the highest degree\nPut your hands on the chalkboard scratch it with ya nails\nGive me goose pimples when ya put yo tounge on my dimples\nBaby feel me now you got yo ass suspended\nGot a letter for your parents but I didn't wanna send it\nI stopped by the crib you invited me in\nYou convinced me somehow to sip some juice and gin\nThen you take me to your parent's room and laid me on my back\nYou twisting, kissing ya fist like that\nRubber meets the road till the tire goes flat\nI filled it up with air again baby hold that\nYou a bad girl look you got your sheets all wet\nSqueeze tight so i never forget the teacher's pet\n\n[Chorus: LeShaun (LL Cool

whipped tell your niggas to chill\nI'ma hit you in the backseat and tell you to slide\n(Imagine that)\nMe and my fold got my broads collide\n(Imagine that)\nKnocking girls off two at a time\n(Imagine that)\nDisrespect you and still make you mine (Uh-uh)\n\n[Verse 3: LL Cool J]\nYou was laughing with your girlfriends, sipping a drink\nWhen I came up from behind you and wrapped you with my mink\nGuided you to the dance floor and held you tight\nWe in the Tunnel in the back with the dim red lights\nI'm rocking the tank top baby nothing but ice\nYou rocking the baby tee and mini skirts and spikes\nThe club is so black we can't see our own hands\nI know you feel that bulge through them Fubu pants\nYou bold huh, wanna feel it in your hands\nRub your ass all up on it cause you know that I want it\nGod gave you beauty and you love to flaunt it\nLife is a song, you were born to perform it\nDrink the Cristal at the same time\nGet intoxicated till we lose are minds\nThe crowd seperated as we start to shine\nI lift you in the air your skirt starts to climb\nWe tongue kiss deep in front of the whole crowd\nThe lights start to flash the music is too loud\nWe hit the back door and jump in the limousine\nYou pull up your skirt I put some ice in between\nYou're tired from the dancing so I kiss your feet\nEven though we outside I hear the bass from the beat\nFunkmaster Flex chop it up for the freaks\nDJ Enuff make the mommies wanna creep\nNo problem uh mi spouse no aqui\nTu muy caliente tu vamos con mi\nSi mami I'm the chaffer make it whip\nTake a ride bet you never forget, here we go\n\n[Chorus: LeShaun (LL Cool J)]\nI'ma get you for your paper\nMake you leave you girl\n(Imagine that)\nMake you trick on me around the world\n(Imagine that)\nHave you calling me your ultimate thrill\n(Imagine that)\nI got you whipped tell your niggas to chill\nI'ma hit you in the backseat and tell you to slide\n(Imagine that)\nMe and my fold got my broads collide\n(Imagine

"lyrics": "[Intro: LL Cool J]\nI just want you to fantasize with imagination\nKnow what I'm saying, uh yeah, yeah\nUh, yeah I like that\nGive me some more, some more of my vocals\nYou know sex 'em up a little bit\nYou know what I mean?\n\n[Verse 1: LL Cool J]\nYou're the honey that I see when I'm riding by\nThe one giving me a feeling that I can't deny\nYou got the Prada boots on suede hitting your thigh\nActing like my chrome twenties ain't catching your eye\nSometimes I slow down catch the ass in the mirror\nTurn the fog lights on to see the legs more clearer\nYou're turning me on, keep me standing up\nI wish that I could prove to you that I'm man enough\nI come up to your job and handcuff your boss\nThrow that nigga in the closet and turn the lights off\nThen sit you up on the copy machine\nMake copies of your kitten with my chin in between\nThen I'll take you to the window so the world can see\nBaby I'm down on my knees let your world be free\nPearl tongue, come get up on this desk with me\nMultiple orgasms is your destiny\nWet dream, ride like you're going to Queens\nLike I just gave you fifty thou and ya just turned 18\nTo hell with your boss\nLet that nigga hear you scream\nSounding like that screech on the fax machine\nThen we can take it to the ladies bathroom\nMake your mascara run till you look like a racoon\nTouch yourself baby tell me it's wet\nSqueeze tight so I'll never forget, here we go\n\n[Chorus: LeShaun (LL Cool J)]\nI'ma get you for your paper\nMake you leave you girl\n(Imagine that)\nMake you trick on me around the world\n(Imagine that)\nHave you calling me your ultimate thrill\n(Imagine that)\nI got you whipped tell your niggas to chill\nI'ma hit you in the backseat and tell you to slide\n(Imagine that)\nMe and my fold got my broads collide\n(Imagine that)\nKnocking girls off two at a time\n(Imagine that)\nDisrespect you and still make you mine (Uh-uh)\n\n[Verse 2: LL Cool J]\nUh, imagine I'm your teacher and you stayed after school\nYou've been a bad girl you broke all the rules\nForgot your homework, chewed gum in class\nAnd the only way to fix it is to give me some ass\nI got a three piece suit on sitting at my desk\nI kinda need a shave but my body smell fresh\nYou're wearing a plad skirt and long white socks\nThe vibe is thick baby, we both red hot\nI kiss your neck unbutton your blouse\nLet my fingers make circles on the edge of your mouth\nYour apple's so ripe I'm your tutor for life\nGot your beggin' me to put you on detention tonight\nYou could read the Iliad and the whole Odyssey\nBut no Trojan soldier scold you like me\nMatch the calculus then measure my frequency\nBut when you blast on my lap that's the highest degree\nPut your hands on the chalkboard scratch it with ya nails\nGive me goose pimples when ya put yo tounge on my dimples\nBaby feel me now you got yo ass suspended\nGot a letter for your parents but I didn't wanna send it\nI stopped by the crib you invited me in\nYou convinced me somehow to sip some juice and gin\nThen you take me to your parent's room and laid me on my back\nYou twisting, kissing ya fist like that\nRubber meets the road till the tire goes flat\nI filled it up with air again baby hold that\nYou a bad girl look you got your sheets all wet\nSqueeze tight so i never forget the teacher's pet\n\n[Chorus: LeShaun (LL Cool J)]\nI'ma get you for your paper\nMake you leave you girl\n(Imagine that)\nMake you trick on me around the world\n(Imagine that)\nHave you calling me your ultimate thrill\n(Imagine that)\nI got you whipped tell your niggas to chill\nI'ma hit you in the backseat and tell you to slide\n(Imagine that)\nMe and my fold got my broads collide\n(Imagine that)\nKnocking girls off two at a time\n(Imagine that)\nDisrespect you and still make you mine (Uh-uh)\n\n[Verse 3: LL Cool J]\nYou was laughing with your girlfriends, sipping a drink\nWhen I came up from behind you and wrapped you with my mink\nGuided you to the dance floor and held you tight\nWe in the Tunnel in the back with the dim red lights\nI'm rocking the tank top baby nothing but ice\nYou rocking the baby tee and mini skirts and spikes\nThe club is so black we can't see our own hands\nI know you feel that bulge through them Fubu pants\nYou bold huh, wanna feel it in your hands\nRub your ass all up on it cause you know that I want it\nGod gave you beauty and you love to flaunt it\nLife is a song, you were born to perform it\nDrink the Cristal at the same time\nGet intoxicated till we lose are minds\nThe crowd seperated as we start to shine\nI lift you in the air your skirt starts to climb\nWe tongue kiss deep in front of the whole crowd\nThe lights start to flash the music is too loud\nWe hit the back door and jump in the limousine\nYou pull up your skirt I put some ice in between\nYou're tired from the dancing so I kiss your feet\nEven though we outside I hear the bass from the beat\nFunkmaster Flex chop it up for the freaks\nDJ Enuff make the mommies wanna creep\nNo problem uh mi spouse no aqui\nTu muy caliente tu vamos con mi\nSi mami I'm the chaffer make it whip\nTake a ride bet you never forget, here we go\n\n[Chorus: LeShaun (LL Cool J)]\nI'ma get you for your paper\nMake you leave you girl\n(Imagine that)\nMake you trick on me around the world\n(Imagine that)\nHave you calling me your ultimate thrill\n(Imagine that)\nI got you whipped tell your niggas to chill\nI'ma hit you in the backseat and tell you to slide\n(Imagine that)\nMe and my fold got my broads collide\n(Imagine that)\nKnocking girls off two at a time\n(Imagine that)\nDisrespect you and still make you mine (Uh-uh)"}}, {"title": "Father", "album": "Phenomenon", "year": "1998-01-13", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nI swear to tell the truth and nothin but the truth...\nSo help me God\nI just felt like tellin the story of my life\nFelt like, maybe somebody could be inspired, you know?\nWe all feel pain, we all go through things\nBut it's time to overcome all that\n\n[Verse 1]\nIf your plane crashed in the water and everybody died\nWould you drown on purpose or try to survive?\nI was born handicapped my arm wouldn't move\nThey called me a cripple pops caught an attitude\nBeat my moms smoked lye drove trucks\nMy moms had a miscarriage, he didn't give a fuck\nHe sniffed some coke, come home\nBeat up on my moms cause she's talkin on the phone\nCome on\n\n[Chorus]\n(all I ever wanted)\nAll I ever wanted\n(all I ever needed)\nAll I ever needed\n(was a father)\nWas a father\n(that's all)\nThat's all!\n(all I ever wanted)\nAll I ever wanted\n(all I ever needed)\nAll I ever needed... was a father\n(was a father)\n\n[Verse 2]\nMoms got tired of the beatings said, \"Yo, we got to go\"\nPacked up her bags we bounced out the do'\nShe said, \"I ain't takin these whippin's no mo'\nI wanna live to see my little Todd grow\"\nI remember tear drops on my pops face\nLookin down at me standin on the staircase\nHandsome brother with a smooth goatee\nMakes me wonder why he act so ugly, you feelin me?\n(I'm feelin you)\n\n[Chorus]\n(all I ever wanted)\nAll I ever wanted\n(all I ever needed)\nAll I ever needed\n(was a father)\nWas a father\n(that's

some Jack Dan', sniffed up a ounce\nGrabbed the shotty left Long Isle for Queens\nPossesed by a demon... a devil it seemed\nI was too young to understand the risk\nWhen your moms come home off the midnight shift\nShe turned around heard the shotgun click\nMy pops said, \"You think that you could leave me {bitch}?\"\nHe blasted my moms in the back\nShe fell down screamin I can't forget that\nMy grandfather tried to close the do'\nHe got shot ten times in the stomach yo, for real\n\n[Chorus]\n(all I ever wanted)\nAll I ever wanted\n(all I ever needed)\nAll I ever needed\n(was a father)\nWas a

blood\nFour years old, this don't feel like love\nAnyway, pops dissapeared\nGrandpops and moms healed up over the years\nThis therapist got up in her head\nLed her to believe without him she'd be dead\nYou know, they fell in love with one another\nEverything seemed right that's word to mother\nUntil I started gettin beatings everday\nSometimes for going outside to play\nLate at night on my knees I'd pray\nA young child, wishin the pain would go away\nDad where was you when he made me strip\nBeat with belts like a slave with a whip\nKicked me down steps outside in the snow\nPunched me in the chest stomped me out on the flo'\nThat's just the tip of the iceberg look\nIt's too long for a song but perfect for a book\nWord is bond, that's real baby\n\n[Chorus]\n(all I ever wanted)\nAll I ever wanted\n(all I ever needed)\nAll I ever needed\n(was a father)\nWas a father\n(that's all)\nThat's all!\n(all I ever wanted)\nAll I ever wanted\n(all I ever needed)\nAll I ever needed... was a

felt like tellin the story of my life\nFelt like, maybe somebody could be inspired, you know?\nWe all feel pain, we all go through things\nBut it's time to overcome all that\n\n[Verse 1]\nIf your plane crashed in the water and everybody died\nWould you drown on purpose or try to survive?\nI was born handicapped my arm wouldn't move\nThey called me a cripple pops caught an attitude\nBeat my moms smoked lye drove trucks\nMy moms had a miscarriage, he didn't give a fuck\nHe sniffed some coke, come home\nBeat up on my moms cause she's talkin on the phone\nCome on\n\n[Chorus]\n(all I ever wanted)\nAll I ever wanted\n(all I ever needed)\nAll I ever needed\n(was a father)\nWas a father\n(that's all)\nThat's all!\n(all I ever wanted)\nAll I ever wanted\n(all I ever needed)\nAll I ever needed... was a father\n(was a father)\n\n[Verse 2]\nMoms got tired of the beatings said, \"Yo, we got to go\"\nPacked up her bags we bounced out the do'\nShe said, \"I ain't takin these whippin's no mo'\nI wanna live to see my little Todd grow\"\nI remember tear drops on my pops face\nLookin down at me standin on the staircase\nHandsome brother with a smooth goatee\nMakes me wonder why he act so ugly, you feelin me?\n(I'm feelin you)\n\n[Chorus]\n(all I ever wanted)\nAll I ever wanted\n(all I ever needed)\nAll I ever needed\n(was a father)\nWas a father\n(that's all)\nThat's all!\n(all I ever wanted)\nAll I ever wanted\n(all I ever needed)\nAll I ever needed... was a father\n(was a father)\n\n[Verse 3]\nMy pops got drunk when me and my moms bounced\nSwigged some Jack Dan', sniffed up a ounce\nGrabbed the shotty left Long Isle for Queens\nPossesed by a demon... a devil it seemed\nI was too young to understand the risk\nWhen your moms come home off the midnight shift\nShe turned around heard the shotgun click\nMy pops said, \"You think that you could leave me {bitch}?\"\nHe blasted my moms in the back\nShe fell down screamin I can't forget that\nMy grandfather tried to close the do'\nHe got shot ten times in the stomach yo, for real\n\n[Chorus]\n(all I ever wanted)\nAll I ever wanted\n(all I ever needed)\nAll I ever needed\n(was a father)\nWas a father\n(that's all)\nThat's all!\n(all I ever wanted)\nAll I ever wanted\n(all I ever needed)\nAll I ever needed... was a father\n(was a father)\n\n[Verse 4]\nMy head was spinnin, I had never seen blood\nFour years old, this don't feel like love\nAnyway, pops dissapeared\nGrandpops and moms healed up over the years\nThis therapist got up in her head\nLed her to believe without him she'd be dead\nYou know, they fell in love with one another\nEverything seemed right that's word to mother\nUntil I started gettin beatings everday\nSometimes for going outside to play\nLate at night on my knees I'd pray\nA young child, wishin the pain would go away\nDad where was you when he made me strip\nBeat with belts like a slave with a whip\nKicked me down steps outside in the snow\nPunched me in the chest stomped me out on the flo'\nThat's just the tip of the iceberg look\nIt's too long for a song but perfect for a book\nWord is bond, that's real baby\n\n[Chorus]\n(all I ever wanted)\nAll I ever wanted\n(all I ever needed)\nAll I ever needed\n(was a father)\nWas a father\n(that's all)\nThat's all!\n(all I ever wanted)\nAll I ever wanted\n(all I ever needed)\nAll I ever needed... was a father\n(was a

intervention divine\nI gave you the gift for missing me\nIt\u2019s all bout design\n\n[Hook : Joe & (LL Cool J)]\nFor your talking, (it\u2019s a privilege to be mine)\nFor your loving, (i put it all on the line)\n(All nights, you can come, all day, you can shop)\n(Let the bells jingeling and let the champagne pop)\n12 to 6 and 6 to 9, round the clock i\u2019m riding high\nCan you take it, (take it), take it, (take it), take it?\nLet me love you babe, I won\u2019t make you wait\nCan you take it, (take it), take it, (take it), take it?\n\n[Verse 2 : LL Cool J]\nIgnore the clock, it\u2019s time to make the bed rock\nThis hood, we don\u2019t even hear the sirens or gun shots\nI\u2019m stroking you\u2019re floating and what not\nSkin sticky but no hickies, better knock\nThe tensions tie,

behind\nPressure bus fights, relax, you\u2019ll be fine\nLl got the remedy intervention divine\nI gave you the gift for missing me\nIt\u2019s all bout design\n\n[Hook : Joe & (LL Cool J)]\nFor your talking, (it\u2019s a privilege to be mine)\nFor your loving, (i put it all on the line)\n(All nights, you can come, all day, you can shop)\n(Let the bells jingeling and let the champagne pop)\n12 to 6 and 6 to 9, round the clock i\u2019m riding high\nCan you take it, (take it), take it, (take it), take it?\nLet me love you babe, I won\u2019t make you wait\nCan you take it, (take it), take it, (take it), take it?\n\n[Verse 2 : LL Cool J]\nIgnore the clock, it\u2019s time to make the bed rock\nThis hood, we don\u2019t even hear the sirens or gun shots\nI\u2019m stroking you\u2019re floating and what not\nSkin sticky but no hickies, better knock\nThe tensions tie, i\u2019m outside the box\nI pin on your balloon without making it pop\nIt feels like new year\u2019s but 2 balls drop\nAlmost at the top, now you begging me to stop\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3 : LL Cool J]\nTake a ride, look down in my eyes\nFlooded like my chain I can drown in your thighs\nA little bit of pain brings joy to your life\nLay your head back, relax and get right\nSouls unified beneath the moonlight\nIt\u2019s only you and i, no other invites\nI wanna see you naked, watch you take it\nCome here\u2026 so are

just standin' around\nHundred-bottles in your pocket, forty-dog in your hand\nDon't you know you're just a worker and your boss is my man?\nL.L. this, L.L. that, soon as I walk in the place\nI wanna take my gun and shoot you in your muthafuckin' face\nYou're playin' me too close with the schemin' and games\nI guess the beef and the bullshit is the price of fame\nMovies, records, goin' on tour\nTwenty-thousand people hip-hoppin' on the floor\nWhole parties body-rockin', and everything's chill\nGet back to New York, and the suckers act ill\nSee I fought with the devil, made a promise to God\nI have experience in goin' all the way to the top\nIt's harder harder than hard\nAll the suckers are barred\nYou used to try to talk down now your ego is scarred\nSee the problem is you want what another man has\nHis car, his wife, or his razzamatazz\nBut that's weak, you gotta do work on your own\nCuz when you're rich you got friends\nBut when you're poor you're alone\nSo get your own on your own, it'll strengthen your soul\nStop livin' off your parents like you're three years old\nInstead of walkin' like you're limp and talkin' yang about me\nWhy don't you take your monkey-ass and get a college degree?\nOr write a rhyme and ride a bike and try to live carefree\nHope my message reaches you before you're seventy-three\nA old man, when people ask you what you did with your life\nYou'll say \"I hated L.L. and I carried a big knife\"\nEvery day is a chase, every day is a race\nAnd every day you're being overpowered by my bass\nToo much juice to be a deuce, I had to be a ace\nIt's like the fire's in my eyes and the gun's in my face\nI'm stompin' stupid knuckleheads until they bleed\nI'm the leader of the show, so it's up to me to lead\nI'mma lead you away from drugs and petty crime\nLead you away from wack beats and rhyme\nLead you to that ticket line\nSo you can come in my show and watch the stars shine\nGet busy, not dizzy, wanna teach the young\nThe last man who didn't listen ended up gettin' hung\nNot that I killed him, it's just\nHe didn't wanna trust\nThe words of a master that's why you must\nTake heed to the speech, it's gonna reach your ear\nDon't try to say you can't hear cuz the words are clear\nThrowin' flurries, punks scurry and I bury the rest\nYou better hurry up and rock a rhyme and give it your best\nCuz tonight's the night we gonna see the big fight\nTwelve-gauge on the stage in case it don't go right\nE-Love drives a tank, he's strong like a truck\nIf you're cryin' while you're dyin' we ain't givin' a fuck\nL.L. Cool J is on the microphone\nTellin' all you punk ducks \"Leave me the hell alone\"\nCuz I'm rated X, born to snap necks\nStraight up and down, no special effects\nI'm the professor, the teacher, the hip-hop dean\nIf Russia bombed the U.S., they'd be scared to touch Queens\nCuz that's where I live, and this is what I give\nTurnin' top-notch crews into fugitives\nThey run, they frightened, they hide from King Titan\nLike a sniper when he's shootin' or a viper when he's bitin'\nHere I am, tellin' the truth\nAnd I'm spreadin' the word to my fellow youth\nIt goes man-to-man and jam-to-jam\nI got hip-hop, rock, and love song fans\nAll you petty MC's in the state of New York\nGettin' a thousand for a show but you still wanna squawk\nCan't get a decent contract, your beats ain't workin'\nDogged-out Pumas plus you're manager's jerkin'\nYour mic sounds weak, remember that skeezer\nI'm badder than Napoleon, Hitler or Caesar\nI'm a hitman, but I'm not for hire\nFly girl's desire, the man you admire\nNot only on the stage, I rock in the park\nAnd I'm a killer in the daytime, and worse after dark\nSo don't never ever mess with the king of the sound\nL.L. Cool J, the baddest around"}}, {"title": "Shut 'Em Down", "album": "G.O.A.T.

immaculate\nEvolutionary flows y'all want more dough\nBang with the best, get a vest, all the rest, should've blessed\nRip a nigga from the East to the West\nJust a lyrical maze, lyrical days\nGod works in mysterious ways\nI'm the warlord of war relieve the raw dog\nNiggas ain't even comin' close to my low score\nNiggas fleein' when I'm rippin' on the hardcore beat\nThat's slammin' through your jeep like a .44 MAC to your back\nNigga L never got ripped by a track\nI don't fuck around, always come back\nFor the lyrical miracle day one platinum plaque right off the bat\nLooked at every nigga

it?\nMy shit's exquisite, don't follow the yellow brick road\nThem niggas faking like the Wizard\n\n(Chorus)\n\n[LL Cool J]\nIs it really possible I'm this hot?\nLL Cool J, still on top?\n24 years, I ain't forget the block\nYou can ask my Jay in the shop\nLinden Boulevard, little Coupe, big rocks\nReal estate only, I ain't fucking with the stocks\nWhy not, so our grandkids could feed they grandkids\nAnd they grandkids, can feed they damn kids\nAnd Collin Park throw ya hands in the air\nJump before I turn 'em in a Cool J affair\nMy word is my bond, every summer I'm there\nYa'll can jump double dutch while I'm laying in the cut\nI told ya'll I wasn't giving up\nI told ya'll, I can jump on tracks and switch the rhythm up\nDo work, treat rap like a ripped skirt\nSow it up, rep your hood, nigga, throw it up\nYou'd been standing by my side for years\nSold out concerts, screams and cheers\nFront row T-Shirt, L, we here\nI bought every album, too many to count 'em\nWatch your movies, your the only good thing about 'em\nTodd Smith jeans, I can't live without 'em\nAnd the only thing I want from you\nIs for you to keep doing that shit you do\n\n(Chorus 2x)", "image":

paper, the inch to penicillin\nI told ya'll the real, they started catching feelings\nMuthafuck 'em all, throw ya L's to the ceiling\nCool J, still hotter than a helicopter crashing in lava\nStill sweeter to the ladies than a box of Godiva\nMusic industry is like a game of cops and robbers\nToo many Indians, no chiefs to follow\nWhat I'm sowing today, I be reaping tomorrow\nSo here's some joyful bars, to replace your sorrow\nI'm beyond a legend, I'm iconic\nFall off, rebuild, your man's bionic\nPut your trust in me, I never let you down\nI always come up with a way to checkmate these clowns\nI effeminate these clowns, trynna take me down\nAsk Puffy and Nas, who 'hates me now'\nThe Phenomenon, ladies love the don\nI give 'em an ear-gasm, they can't keep calm\n\n(Chorus: LL Cool J)\nOld school, new school, need to learn though\nI burn baby burn like disco inferno\nOld school, new school, need to learn though\nI burn baby burn like disco inferno\n\n[LL Cool J]\nI told ya'll that I was coming back\nI told ya'll I ain't going out like that\nI told ya'll I was the greatest to ever rap\nAnd I built Def Jam and took a piss on the map\nI told ya'll, I wasn't like the other cats\nI'm fresh like a Wii, them niggas playing jacks\nThey all a bunch of a rats, they copying off 2Pac's stats\nWearing tuxedos to hide they tight speedo\nChains is tucked in, I'm incognito\nFuck with your ego, and touch your girl's labito\nThere will never be one flyer, LL Cool J\nTaking you higher and higher\nThe wire, the GOAT, the grand sire\nWho good are 24's if you on flat tires\nTelling your soul and then performing with a choir\nPeople, please, don't listen to these liars\nLadies and gentlemen, these, niggas is selling you up\nBunch of irrelevant shit, it's not intelligent, is

ain't forget the block\nYou can ask my Jay in the shop\nLinden Boulevard, little Coupe, big rocks\nReal estate only, I ain't fucking with the stocks\nWhy not, so our grandkids could feed they grandkids\nAnd they grandkids, can feed they damn kids\nAnd Collin Park throw ya hands in the air\nJump before I turn 'em in a Cool J affair\nMy word is my bond, every summer I'm there\nYa'll can jump double dutch while I'm laying in the cut\nI told ya'll I wasn't giving up\nI told ya'll, I can jump on tracks and switch the rhythm up\nDo work, treat rap like a ripped skirt\nSow it up, rep your

baby, bring it in, bring it)\n\nJames Todd Smith when nine years old\nWhen 'Sugarhill' was in control\nI'm listenin' to cold-crushed tapes to get sold\nI set my demo in a Silvia treated me cold\nTime flew cause I was gettin' my shit off\nSixteen now, it's about the time to set my first hit off\n\n'I Need A Beat', it was a smash on the DL\nBut every time I did a show my name was misspelled\n'Can't Live Without My Radio' drops\nI'm kickin' down the door-crushed cool box\n'Rockin' the bells' like a madman dissin' me\nEvent-flippin' the script-but then I made my first 50 grand\n\nAll I wanted was a pencil, a little gold\nA little money in my pocket and a Phillie to roll\nI'm makin' records, now alla the girls are on my tip\nI'm sleepin' late, no money damn, I'm late for school, shit\n\nTodd, get upstairs and take out that garbage\n\nAnd it's the funkadelic relic, yeah\n(Bring in the funk baby, bring in the funk)\nAnd it's the funkadelic relic, yeah\n(Bring in the funk baby, bring in the funk)\nIt's the funkadelic relic, yeah\n(Bring in the funk baby, bring it in, bring it)\n\nI wasn't tryin' to hear it cause I'm bad\nWhen I'm alone in my room, I pick up a pen and start to get mad\nI need love, that means I need a girl to love me down\nI dropped the pretty style cause rap was gettin' ugly\nI waited a year for the results, I'm triple platinum\nWe know the presidents are flowin' by who's sackin' 'em\n\nI'm that type of guy when poppa wasn't happy with it\nTripplin' 'em up, that was my style, but everybody bit it\nYo Marley, hit the remix, make it fresh with flavor\nAnother power move, I'll switch my hat, the shit is major\nPuttin' out till da break of dawn', tell me what sucker?\nCops harass me illegal search motherfucker\n\nI'm just a brother makin' jams now I got a name\nI still remember chillin' with my pistol on the train\nI'm sayin' two to this I'm representin' hip hop\nAdmit that I'm the man, it's time for me to get my props\n\nYeah, and it's the funkadelic relic\n(Bring in the funk baby, bring in the funk)\nYeah, and it's the funkadelic relic\n(Bring in the funk baby, bring in the funk)\nYeah, I'm the funkadelic relic, yeah\n(Bring in the funk baby, bring it in, bring it)\nCome on man\n\nMama said to knock 'em out' I knocked 'em out the box\nI got a rhyme to wake, you're sloppin' up and down the blocks\nThere never was a time when I was down to meetin' by myself\nWhen all the punks on top of everybody else, but\n\nIn '92 and '93 I'm makin' history\nThe largest motherfuckin' street, that ain't no mystery\nThe baddest rapper ever born, you think I'm crazy?\nI heard your albums' kinda warm, that shit don't phase me\nI'm too rough, too rugged, now that doesn't sound so easy does it\nThought I was going back to Cali' where I knew I wasn't\n\nI sent a 'Murder Gram', solo in a black van\nI'm claimin' knuckle game, stomp you with my Timberland\n'Mr. Goodbar' lickin' all the rough stuff\nI'm kickin' down your door with condoms in a rudder-put\nYou wanna find me come to Farmers Boulevard\nAnd you can hear me, eat 'em up, just ask for Todd\n\nUh, and I'm the funkadelic relic\nYeah, I'm the funkadelic relic\n(Bring in the funk baby, bring it in, bring it)\nYeah, and it's the funkadelic relic\n(Bring in the funk baby, bring it in, bring it)\nYeah, I'm the funkadelic relic\n(Bring in the funk baby, bring it in, bring it)\n\nBring in the funk baby, bring in the funk\nBring in the funk baby, bring in the funk\nBring in the funk baby, bring in the funk\nBring in the funk\n\nBring in the funk baby, bring in the

13\"\n\n[Chorus]\nOnce I live a life of a millionaire\nStill do!\nSpending my money, honey ohh I didn't care\nStill don't!\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'ma floss 'til I die, ball never fall\nCop 'til I drop, motherfuck 'em all\nCount paper schemin, leanin on the wall\nMoney comin fast, niggas ridin balls\nI been to hell and back, I seen what you saw\n6 in the mornin, D's at the door\nI was a shorty on a bike, hangin with Alpo\nI was a shorty uptown with Rich Porter\nI was a shorty up on 1, 3, 2\nMy man AZ he really schooled me\nMy man Big Chuck, he took me to Mt. V\nI messed up the count, Kev winked at me\nWhat I learned is niggas need paper to burn\nAnd you gotta spread love when cats is fucked up\nYou can't be lazy, for niggas that's bad fuck\nSometimes you move quiet and lay upin the cut (whattup)\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 2]\nI learned if you talk to much you get that ass shot up\nFollow your dreams, and watch the cash pile up\nI used to be in Queens with my man Black Just\nBefore he got killed, now that nigga was real\nHe took me to the crib, showed me how gangsters live\nTook me to hot blocks, showed me big knots\nHim and Richard Porter used to tease me and what not\nYou ain't movin pies, so your car can be fly\nUsed to run to Big Kev before he got knocked\nWhen niggas was stuntin and wouldn't let me on the block\n125th in the Beemer with AZ\nHe gave a bum 50 dollars that really taught me\nThat being a gangster don't mean you're all bad\nAnd niggas respect you when they know you got cash\nRemember Big dave had the dust on smash\nI was amazed the lifestyle was so fast\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI remember Remy showed my his first 8th ki'\nThat was before Queens had blood in the street\nStretch from BK had the pretty gold Benz\nHe took me out to Brooklyn where he was gettin some ends\nLet me state this again, I ain't gotta pretend\nThey was playing the money game and I wanted in\nI was just a young boy with dangerous friends\nIf it wasn't for rap, who knows where I would've been\nI took a hustlas heart to make the top of the charts\nBig Chuck when to jail when i was ready to start\nI guess i was destin, God pulled us apart\nBut I admit, getting that street money is a art\nI was so many players I knew back in the D\nLike Cuban Alberto from Mi-ami\n'86 that nigga's Benz had TV's\nOnly God knows what these niggas mean to me\nReal talk\n\n[Chorus]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9e00cf56336ec8915e2fa3b2b2e7502d.377x377x1.jpg", "artist": "LL Cool J", "raw": {"annotation_count": 5, "api_path": "/songs/29108",

13\"\n\n[Chorus]\nOnce I live a life of a millionaire\nStill do!\nSpending my money, honey ohh I didn't care\nStill don't!\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'ma floss 'til I die, ball never fall\nCop 'til I drop, motherfuck 'em all\nCount paper schemin, leanin on the wall\nMoney comin fast, niggas ridin balls\nI been to hell and back, I seen what you saw\n6 in the mornin, D's at the door\nI was a shorty on a bike, hangin with Alpo\nI was a shorty uptown with Rich Porter\nI was a shorty up on 1, 3, 2\nMy man AZ he really schooled me\nMy man Big Chuck, he took me to Mt. V\nI messed up the count, Kev winked at me\nWhat I learned is niggas need paper to burn\nAnd you gotta spread love when cats is fucked up\nYou can't be lazy, for niggas that's bad fuck\nSometimes you move quiet and lay upin the cut (whattup)\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 2]\nI learned if you talk to much you get that ass shot up\nFollow your dreams, and watch the cash pile up\nI used to be in Queens with my man Black Just\nBefore he got killed, now that nigga was real\nHe took me to the crib, showed me how gangsters live\nTook me to hot blocks, showed me big knots\nHim and Richard Porter used to tease me and what not\nYou ain't movin pies, so your car can be fly\nUsed to run to Big Kev before he got knocked\nWhen niggas was stuntin and wouldn't let me on the block\n125th in the Beemer with AZ\nHe gave a bum 50 dollars that really taught me\nThat being a gangster don't mean you're all bad\nAnd niggas respect you when they know you got cash\nRemember Big dave had the dust on smash\nI was amazed the lifestyle was so fast\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI remember Remy showed my his first 8th ki'\nThat was before Queens had blood in the street\nStretch from BK had the pretty gold Benz\nHe took me out to Brooklyn where he was gettin some ends\nLet me state this again, I ain't gotta pretend\nThey was playing the money game and I wanted in\nI was just a young boy with dangerous friends\nIf it wasn't for rap, who knows where I would've been\nI took a hustlas heart to make the top of the charts\nBig Chuck when to jail when i was ready to start\nI guess i was destin, God pulled us apart\nBut I admit, getting that street money is a art\nI was so many players I knew back in the D\nLike Cuban Alberto from Mi-ami\n'86 that nigga's Benz had TV's\nOnly God knows what these niggas mean to me\nReal talk\n\n[Chorus]"}}, {"title": "Get Down", "album": "Bigger and Deffer", "year": "1987-05-29", "lyrics": "[LL Cool J]\nG, G, G, G, G, G Get...\n\n[LL Cool J]\nDown, to the rhythm that'll rock the walls\nCold sportin' Air Jordans, and I'm on the ball\nDon't lack and I'm black but I'm not Lou Rawls\nDisappeared for a year now I'm back y'all\nSo get down with me, entrepreneur of funk\nNot a sloppy fat punk or a Shaolin Monk\nAin't down with Johnny Cousin know as use at a jam\nSo the hell with Ed McMahon and Tom Macan\nJVC is the box, Farmers is the street\nSoundin' hungry over beats, that's why I always eat\nUp to you to guess who's rockin' the funky sound\nIf you don't know never mind come on and get down\n\n[Hook]\nGo L.L., go L.L., go L.L., go L.L\nGet Down\nGo L.L., go L.L., go L.L\nGet Down\n\n[LL Cool J]\nGet down, hard like Haystacks Calhoun\nCallin me a sucker boy you're pushin a broom\nIf you try to pull a ace you'll get a punch in the face\nAll eyes are on my posse when we walk in the place\nNot the Cunningham family from Happy Days\nNot the boys who play the bench for the Oakland A's\nHe drop you to a hop to the record he play\nCouldn't keep it a secret I'm L.L. Cool J\nRhymes are all wack and real all real\nYo Earl, tell the party people the deal\n\n[Earl]\nYo listen here\nYa ain't no thing, can't complain\nGet cash like a muh'fuck, pass the \"J\"\n\n[LL Cool J]\nThat's right I'm back he's talks out rap\nYou used to smirk, now you're jockin' cause my name's on the map\nSit and lie my homeboy Earl says that it's a E-Love hat\nWith the hands like a hatchet, Cut Creator's in back\nCut Creator on the fader, the teacher's pet\nBaddest man with ten fingers you've ever met\nAnd sooner or later we'll house the set\nCut Creator cut the record so they don't forget\nGet down\n\n[Hook]\nGo L.L., go L.L., go L.L\nGet Down\nGo L.L., go L.L., go L.L\n\n[LL Cool J]\nI make hard rock jams for hard rock fans\nWhat I'm sayin's for real, this ain't la-la land\nGot a can full of jams pullin off the lid\nCompetition in New York can't do what I did\nNo Cinderella story, I paid my dues\nI rocked at house parties I was down with crews\nNow I'll never be caught I'm on my P's and Q's\nAnd for the rest of your life you wanna be in my shoes\nI'm strong like stone, hard like cement\nAnd I rocked every jam that I ever went\nCause I got a better reppin than any emcee has\nAnd I'm bad like a brother from Alcatraz\nGet down\n\n[Hook]\nGo L.L., go L.L., go L.L\nGet Down\nGo L.L., go L.L., go L.L\n\n[LL Cool J]\nNi-ni-nigga-nigga-ni-ni-ni-\nNinja of rap, the boss is back\nThe only man you should call on when the party is packed\nFrom Paris to L.A they say I'm sharp as a pin\nWhen it's a Cool J party you gotta get in\nSo I can make you kick steps like Gladys Knight and the Pips\nOne rhyme, you're on my tip, soon as it leaves my lips\nUp the block kids are talkin and spreadin the news\nAbout the new grandmaster the one you'll choose\nCause I'm treacherous, I wanna stomp the rest\nWhat I'm kickin' couldn't bore, it can only impress\nI'm not a Hula-Hoop, this ain't no passin' phase\nHard work pays, I'm gettin straight-up A's\nCool J is runnin' things, I want it understood\nExecutioner, I should wear a black hood\nAnd carry an axe cause I'm ruff on wax\nSpeakers speakin ?phone-wear from durable? eight-tracks\nGet down\n\n(G, G, G, G,

walls\nCold sportin' Air Jordans, and I'm on the ball\nDon't lack and I'm black but I'm not Lou Rawls\nDisappeared for a year now I'm back y'all\nSo get down with me, entrepreneur of funk\nNot a sloppy fat punk or a Shaolin Monk\nAin't down with Johnny Cousin know as use at a jam\nSo the hell with Ed McMahon and Tom Macan\nJVC is the box, Farmers is the street\nSoundin' hungry over beats, that's why I always eat\nUp to you to guess who's rockin' the funky sound\nIf you don't know never mind come on and get down\n\n[Hook]\nGo L.L., go L.L., go L.L., go L.L\nGet Down\nGo L.L., go L.L., go L.L\nGet Down\n\n[LL Cool J]\nGet down, hard like Haystacks Calhoun\nCallin me a sucker boy you're pushin a broom\nIf you try to pull a ace you'll get a punch in the face\nAll eyes are on my posse when we walk in the place\nNot the Cunningham family from Happy Days\nNot the boys who play the bench for the Oakland A's\nHe drop you to a hop to the record he play\nCouldn't keep it a secret I'm

over the phone, it's safe to do it raw\nImaginary worlds we could both explore\n(Hello) Baby what you wearin' right now?\n(Hot pants) My girl ain't around, let's get down\nAnd I hope the phone's tapped, let's pretend you on my lap\n(I'm bouncin' up and down with my shoulders back)\n(Nigga you like that?)  You see I'm runnin' up my bill\nMomma might hear me, but you just too ill\nI got your flicks lined up, stereo low\nCherry flavored grease beneath my elbow\nIf I was there what would you do?  (I'd lay you on your back)\n(Ride or die daddy, and I love it like that)\n\n[Chorus: Amil (LL Cool J)]\nHello, hello (yo, yo)\nHello, hello (yo, yo)\nHello, hello (yo, yo)\nHello, hello (yo, yo)\nHello, hello (yo, yo)\nHello, hello (yo, yo)\n{Call me on the telephone}\n\n[Verse 2: LL Cool J (Amil)]\nYou the freak of my dreams, the reason that I keep on baggy jeans\n(Oooh, I love me a nigga from killer Queens)\n(I'ma rub up on your muscles, ride 'til I'm sweatin' it)\n(I bet you I can make you cum first) throw the bets in\nI'm a nasty nigga, made to order\nKiss below the border with a warm glass of water\nIs you wit me?

(In the hood)\n(Talkin' on the phone like a good girl should\nTo my nig', baby I'ma reach my peak)\nStrawberry shortcake, good enough to eat\n(And I taste mad sweet) We big freaks\nBlastin' off on the phone seven days a week, uh\n\n[Chorus: Amil (LL Cool J)]\nHello, hello (yo, yo)\nHello, hello (yo, yo)\nHello, hello (yo, yo)\nHello, hello (yo, yo)\nHello, hello (yo, yo)\nHello, hello (yo, yo)\n{Call me on the telephone}\n\n[Verse 3: LL Cool J (Amil)]\nI throw sugar in the water so the ice tastes sweet\nTo make sure your ex-man can't compete\nShower curtain on the bed, warm baby oil\nG-string sittin' like a snake in a coil\n(Hold on, I think somebody on the other line)\nInterrupt this nut I'ma bust, you out your mind\nLay back, imagine us chest to chest\nTongue-kissin' deep while we spark a sess\n(Everything is crazy, L do it the best)\nRidin' rough baby, put my pipe to the test\n(On the telephone?)

you like a lil nigga 'cause you is\nBut don't forget that daddy's gonna always love his kids\nFaggot niggas got the nerve to wan' know why I rob\nYou guys are livin' phat while everybody else'll starve!\nThat pretty shit is lame, fuck what your name hold\nBreak a nigga off somethin', watch a nigga gain fo'\nNow you layin somewhere cold, stiff as shit\nAnd all that riffin' shit, mens will get

Cool\nSoakin' wet with bad bitches in the indoor pool\nYo what am I, an animal?\n'Cause I bagged your's too\nOne bad mooley, nigga you can't school me\nI'm the G.O.A.T., what I wrote cause fire and smoke\nTo think I started on the choir singin' solo for the pope\nTell your mama please, get up off her knees\nYou can't wear yellow spandex with a ass like cottage cheese\nOpen toed shoes, feet smell like collard greens\nToes Kriss Krossed like she on J. Dupri's team\nBunyon you're sittin' up like beach balls in the sand plus\nA mouth full of rotten teeth with a dildo in her hand\nWho the fuck let you in, all my assistants are fired\nNow I'm lookin' for some washed up rapper that I can hire\nYou know some old school nigga with a bit of attitude\nPay him $1500 to fuck a girl in an interlude\nYou say I'm souped up, well, soup is good food\nSo what I scratch my nuts, HOW THE FUCK IS THAT RUDE?\nFor soul glowin, afro pickin'\nS-curl hatin', Jamaican rum sippin'\nKid I'll burp on your girl buttcheeks\n'Cause honey had my nuts like two red beets\nI'm bananas, out of my fuckin mind they won't let me back in\n'Cause I was down before the hype like Dusty Rhodes and Bob Backlund\nBruno Samartino, Stan Staziak\nNow The Rock and Stone Cold are my favorite maniacs\nThe top rooster pluckin', chickens when I\u2019m cluckin'\nWWF stands for When and Where we Fuckin\n\n[Chorus: LL Cool J]\nFuhgidabowdit\nYo

Menace II Society\nI roll through the drive-thru like Kane\nJack you for the cheeseburgers and chicken wings, and Daytons too\nSee my boys down the ride crack patience too\nBricks, walk around, snorkel down\nMacaroni and cheese Timbs broke out the orphan house\nTransportin out, the poison in 'em\nBox 'em up in the aisle with the frozen dinners\nAnd them niggas that ran...\nMy goal's to get 'em\nWith the heat seekin' flow with, fo' antennas\nDoc's Da Name, that's why y'all fuck with me\nI'm pocket change, the bums don't fuck with D\nObjective in 'em, Carlo inspection sticka\nCheck the pen, I write like a X was in 'em\nTeeth grittin', I brawl with a major league mitten\nWhere the stash at, punk?\nYo, yo, and he takin me with him\n\n[Chorus: Redman]\nFuhgidabowdit\nYo,

cuffs and, put the eight up, repercussion\nYou know my name, so there's no need for introduction\nI'm Mr. Done it all, so none of y'all can do me nothing\nBitch I'm grown, puffin on that one and bone\nBet me and Queen Bee be swingin' 'til the honey come\nBacks get blown, trash get thrown\nIn headlocks, from this view, I'm fuckin Star Jones\nI'm red hot just like candy, in '95 won the Grammy\nYo, he use it as an ashtray now\nNiggas can't stand or understand me, yeah\nEither or, funky headhunter wild comanchees with shitty draws\nWhat's that shit, what shit, that shit on your lip\nI can't smoke with ya kid, but I'll save ya the clip...\n\n[Chorus: Redman Method Man]\nFuhgidabowdit\nAyo nigga, Fuhgidabowdit\nYo, what the fuck, Fuhgidabowdit\nYo, Fuhgidabowdit\nUh, Fuhgidabowdit

forget it\nTraveling the world on my total devastation tour\nA supercalifragilistic emcee executioner\nWicked witch, digging your ditch\nGiving ya stitch by stitch, ain't this a bitch?\nSweeter than lemonade, stronger than a hand-grenade\nRhymes I laid go deeper than a mermaid\nLouder than a siren, I'm not retirin'\nAspirin', admirin' the way I'm getting fly and\nMCs are kleptos and I resent those\nBrothers who slept on, when they should have kept on\nRollin' with Rush it don't get no rougher\nI'll snuff a huffer and puffer, a brother'll suffer\nI was holding back the man superior, right?\nYou wanna take my title, yo, you'll be alright\nYou stand below the plateau I stand on\nYou want perfection, then put the man on\nI shake and bake and break the laws of gravity\nAnd if you chew on, you'll get a cavity\nCause I'm a giant, and you're a peewee\nAnd all that LL shit, you can't see me\nYou're cheap and weak, incomplete and off-beat\nEhem!

love growing up in Queens\nWe didn't know a thing about love\nWe was innocent sneakin' on the doorstep to hug\nHeld you tightly and promised you the world\nYou gave me hickys and said you was my girl\nWhen I think about it now makes me smile\nCause I ain't felt these butterflies in a while\nFunny how you grow up and innocence fades\nWe used to live for love but now we're afraid (of what?)\nOf the darkness and bitter memories\nLovers who crushed us through infidelity\nI promised you I'd love you to the end\nAlways and forever since way back when\nYou're like candy the world's sweetest friend\nYou taste better now than you did back then\n\n[Chorus: Ralph Tresvant & Ricky Bell]\nYou will always be my candy\nOne day we will start a family\nYou will always be my candy girl\n(you'll be my candy girl forever)\nYou will always be my candy\nWant your love girl understand me\nYou will always be my candy girl\n\n[Verse 2: LL Cool J]\nWhile you sucked caramel apple lolly pops\nRain sleet or snow I'm troopin' up the murdock\nWe used to walk down the block hold hands\nI would get you after school cause I was your man\nAnd any guys that wanna socalize\nJust know that I'm a flip on any cat that trys\nMy peeps used to say I was whipped\nAll your girls said since you got with him you flipped\nBut uh they couldn't feel the feelings we felt\nMirrors on the ceiling we melt\nI would look up at ya I remember\nThe afternoon you surrendered\nWe made love the tempature was high as could be\nYou said Todd promise you ain't liein' to me\nAnd as we went our seperate ways you turned back\nSmiled I remember all that\n\n[Chorus: Ralph Tresvant & Ricky Bell]\nYou will always be my candy\nOne day we will start a family\nYou will always be my candy girl\n(you'll be my candy girl forever)\nYou will always be my candy\nWant your love girl understand me\nYou will always be my candy girl\n\n[Bridge: Ralph Tresvant & Ricky Bell]\nCandy girl\nYou are my world\nLook so sweet\nYou're a special treat\nCandy girl\nAll I want to say\nI need your love\nEach and every day\n\n[Verse 3: LL Cool J]\nWhen I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall\nAnd in the back of my mind I hear my memories call\nOf days when love was true I slept and held you\nTaste the brown sugar let your climax melt yo\nCandy you're occupying all of my thoughts\nTurned my soul upside down with lessons you taught\nI can feel you even when you're far away you're right here wit' me\nSweet love strictly\nAnd I'm a bend over backwards to keep you on my side\nTake you for a mental and emotional ride\nMake love to your soul your heart and your mind\nIn your hour of need girl I'll be there every time\nAnd as long as you support my dreams\nStayin' right beside me as a part of my team\nI'll take you where the average man can only dream of\nCause in a world so sour I got the sweetest love\n\n[Chorus: Ralph Tresvant & Ricky Bell]\nYou will always be my candy\nOne day we will start a family\nYou will always be my candy girl\n(you'll be my candy girl forever)\nYou will always be my candy\nWant your love girl understand me\nYou will always be my candy girl\n\n[Outro: Ralph Tresvant & Ricky Bell]\nCandy girl\nYou are my world\nLook so sweet\nYou're a special trea\n(you'll be my candy girl forever)\nCandy girl\nAll I want to say\n(word is bond sweetheart)\nI need your love\n(I swear I'm down for whatever)\nCandy girl\n(sometimes you gotta go back home)\nLook so sweet\n(I love you)\nCandy girl", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5234ac9d05aa49d6d1b6cc3b58801cac.500x500x1.jpg",

"lyrics": "[Verse 1: LL Cool J]\nWhen you was seventeen and I was nineteen\nWe feel deep in love growing up in Queens\nWe didn't know a thing about love\nWe was innocent sneakin' on the doorstep to hug\nHeld you tightly and promised you the world\nYou gave me hickys and said you was my girl\nWhen I think about it now makes me smile\nCause I ain't felt these butterflies in a while\nFunny how you grow up and innocence fades\nWe used to live for love but now we're afraid (of what?)\nOf the darkness and bitter memories\nLovers who crushed us through infidelity\nI promised you I'd love you to the end\nAlways and forever since way back when\nYou're like candy the world's sweetest friend\nYou taste better now than you did back then\n\n[Chorus: Ralph Tresvant & Ricky Bell]\nYou will always be my candy\nOne day we will start a family\nYou will always be my candy girl\n(you'll be my candy girl forever)\nYou will always be my candy\nWant your love girl understand me\nYou will always be my candy girl\n\n[Verse 2: LL Cool J]\nWhile you sucked caramel apple lolly pops\nRain sleet or snow I'm troopin' up the murdock\nWe used to walk down the block hold hands\nI would get you after school cause I was your man\nAnd any guys that wanna socalize\nJust know that I'm a flip on any cat that trys\nMy peeps used to say I was whipped\nAll your girls said since you got with him you flipped\nBut uh they couldn't feel the feelings we felt\nMirrors on the ceiling we melt\nI would look up at ya I remember\nThe afternoon you surrendered\nWe made love the tempature was high as could be\nYou said Todd promise you ain't liein' to me\nAnd as we went our seperate ways you turned back\nSmiled I remember all that\n\n[Chorus: Ralph Tresvant & Ricky Bell]\nYou will always be my candy\nOne day we will start a family\nYou will always be my candy girl\n(you'll be my candy girl forever)\nYou will always be my candy\nWant your love girl understand me\nYou will always be my candy girl\n\n[Bridge: Ralph Tresvant & Ricky Bell]\nCandy girl\nYou are my world\nLook so sweet\nYou're a special treat\nCandy girl\nAll I want to say\nI need your love\nEach and every day\n\n[Verse 3: LL Cool J]\nWhen I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall\nAnd in the back of my mind I hear my memories call\nOf days when love was true I slept and held you\nTaste the brown sugar let your climax melt yo\nCandy you're occupying all of my thoughts\nTurned my soul upside down with lessons you taught\nI can feel you even when you're far away you're right here wit' me\nSweet love strictly\nAnd I'm a bend over backwards to keep you on my side\nTake you for a mental and emotional ride\nMake love to your soul your heart and your mind\nIn your hour of need girl I'll be there every time\nAnd as long as you support my dreams\nStayin' right beside me as a part of my team\nI'll take you where the average man can only dream of\nCause in a world so sour I got the sweetest love\n\n[Chorus: Ralph Tresvant & Ricky Bell]\nYou will always be my candy\nOne day we will start a family\nYou will always be my candy girl\n(you'll be my candy girl forever)\nYou will always be my candy\nWant your love girl understand me\nYou will always be my candy girl\n\n[Outro: Ralph Tresvant & Ricky Bell]\nCandy girl\nYou are my world\nLook so sweet\nYou're a special trea\n(you'll be my candy girl forever)\nCandy girl\nAll I want to say\n(word is bond sweetheart)\nI need your love\n(I swear I'm down for whatever)\nCandy girl\n(sometimes you gotta go back home)\nLook so sweet\n(I love you)\nCandy girl"}},

steps to the musical feast\nAnd witness the force I'm about to release\nYou'll rock!!\n\n[LL Cool J]\nI'm a professional producer of hip-hop songs\nIn case you're unaware my beats are always strong\nI'll exterminate your crew if I don't like you\nWith one rhyme I subdue my adversaries are through\nI'm the best, fascinatin' my names' Cool J\nI'm the royalty of rap, what else can I say\nExperience, rhymin' skill, plus my voice is on wax\nFunky fresh party rocker, so let's face facts\nI'll dust a rapper off if I require practice\nVocal cords so rough that I can eat cactus\nChoreographer of rhymes, best of all times\nComposition technican with a b-boy's mind\nTerrorizin MCs, destructions' in my path\nMake your girlfriend ask me for my autograph\nI'm the mic dominater, best of all times\nAnd you ain't heard nothin' till you heard J rhyme\nYou'll rock!!\n\n[LL Cool J]\nNow I'm a tell you the name behind the scratchin' sound\nHe's Cut Creator, Philly-Phil, he has the DJ crown\nMe and him are imitatin' but never underated\nMy rhymes and his cuts have been consolidated\nMy mission ain't complete without the use of his hands\nHe makes my rhymes sound fresher, my beat expand\nSo I'd like you to meet him, but don't attempt to beat him\nA five man crew, me and him'll defeat 'em\nHe'll scratch...and wipe out all foes\nTurntable terrorizer and I think you should know\nThat we're - high calibered and my names' J\nAnd for all you sucker crews it's Judgment Day\nDuring this encounter, I'm your rhyme sayer\nI hate to say it girls, but yes, I'm a player\nMaterial royal, dominating all\nLight-brown with dimples and I'm six feet tall\nAnd promoter of recordings that I call my own\nAnd I'll love to take one of you ladies home\nI'll complete and clear, infiltratin' your ears\nMy litera-ture is above Shakespeare\nMC assassinator, and I just won't stop\nI'm the author and the designer of the jam you'll rock\nI'm a lyrical flame on the heels of fame\nAnd the world will be glad that Cool J came\nYou'll rock!!\n\n[LL Cool J]\nNow I'm a dedicate this rhyme to my favorite street\nYou think about it every time that you hear this beat\nAny other jam you hear just dis-regard\nThis is the National Anthem of the Boulevard\nSee I'm loyal to the Boule cause it taught me the deal\nCertainly the place to be and that's how I feel\nFarmers Boulevard, E-Love and me Cool J\nIn the center of it all is the Q-3-A\n42nd will surrender, Delancey's in fear\nQueens Boulevard is soft, they don't come around here\nWith gazelles on my face, I will hold my space\nEntertain, stimulate, and conduct the bass\nYou'll rock!!\n\n[LL Cool J]\nNow I'ma kick it for the beat, check complete my mission\nSubtractin' emcee's like a mathematician\nChairman of the board at the rappin' commission\nSoul inventor of this composition\nI disintegrate rappers I can and I could\nThe great Edgar Allen Poe couldn't write this good\nI'm the warlord of rap with my own army\nJapans' whole military couldn't disarm me\nSuper bad, cold crush, number one b-boy\nLike a paintin' from Picasso, I'm the real McCoy\nCrown Prince of rappin', godfather of beats\nMC's that I meet, I mutilate and defeat\nYou'll rock!!\n\n[LL Cool J]\nYouknowI'msayin'? Break!!\nYouknowI'msayin'? Break!! Break!!

musical feast\nAnd witness the force I'm about to release\nYou'll rock!!\n\n[LL Cool J]\nI'm a professional producer of hip-hop songs\nIn case you're unaware my beats are always strong\nI'll exterminate your crew if I don't like you\nWith one rhyme I subdue my adversaries are through\nI'm the best, fascinatin' my names' Cool J\nI'm the royalty of rap, what else can I say\nExperience, rhymin' skill, plus my voice is on wax\nFunky fresh party rocker, so let's face facts\nI'll dust a rapper off if I require practice\nVocal cords so rough that I can eat cactus\nChoreographer of rhymes, best of all times\nComposition technican with a b-boy's mind\nTerrorizin MCs, destructions' in my path\nMake your girlfriend ask me for my autograph\nI'm the mic dominater, best of all times\nAnd you ain't heard nothin' till you heard J rhyme\nYou'll rock!!\n\n[LL Cool J]\nNow I'm a tell you the name behind the scratchin' sound\nHe's Cut Creator, Philly-Phil, he has the DJ crown\nMe and him are imitatin' but never underated\nMy rhymes and his cuts have been consolidated\nMy mission ain't complete without the use of his hands\nHe makes my rhymes sound fresher, my beat expand\nSo I'd like you to meet him, but don't attempt to beat him\nA five man crew, me and him'll defeat 'em\nHe'll scratch...and wipe out all foes\nTurntable terrorizer and I think you should know\nThat we're - high calibered and my names' J\nAnd for all you sucker crews it's Judgment Day\nDuring this encounter, I'm your rhyme sayer\nI hate to say it girls, but yes, I'm a player\nMaterial royal, dominating all\nLight-brown with dimples and I'm six feet tall\nAnd promoter of recordings that I call my own\nAnd I'll love to take one of you ladies home\nI'll complete and clear, infiltratin' your ears\nMy litera-ture is above Shakespeare\nMC assassinator, and I just won't stop\nI'm the author and the designer of the jam you'll rock\nI'm a lyrical flame on the heels of fame\nAnd the world will be glad that Cool J came\nYou'll rock!!\n\n[LL Cool J]\nNow I'm a dedicate this rhyme to my favorite street\nYou think about it every time that you hear this beat\nAny other jam you hear just dis-regard\nThis is the National Anthem of the Boulevard\nSee I'm loyal to the Boule cause it taught me the deal\nCertainly the place to be and that's how I feel\nFarmers Boulevard, E-Love and me Cool J\nIn the center of it all is the Q-3-A\n42nd will surrender, Delancey's in fear\nQueens Boulevard is soft, they don't come around here\nWith gazelles on my face, I will hold my space\nEntertain, stimulate, and conduct the bass\nYou'll rock!!\n\n[LL Cool J]\nNow I'ma kick it for the beat, check complete my mission\nSubtractin' emcee's like a mathematician\nChairman of the board at the rappin' commission\nSoul inventor of this composition\nI disintegrate rappers I can and I could\nThe great Edgar Allen Poe couldn't write this good\nI'm the warlord of rap with my own army\nJapans' whole military couldn't disarm me\nSuper bad, cold crush, number one b-boy\nLike a paintin' from Picasso, I'm the real McCoy\nCrown Prince of rappin', godfather of beats\nMC's that I meet, I mutilate and defeat\nYou'll rock!!\n\n[LL Cool J]\nYouknowI'msayin'? Break!!\nYouknowI'msayin'? Break!! Break!! Break two!!"}}, {"title": "Mr. President", "album": "Exit 13", "year": "2008-09-05", "lyrics": "[LL Cool J - Verse 1]\nDear Mr. President, with all due respect\nWish we could have a conversation\nI would take a trip down to your residence\nAnd we would talk about the state of the nation\nMr. President, I would ask you about the war\nReally and truly, what is it for?\nWhen a I.E.D. make a soldier fall\nIs he dying for something above us all?\nIs it all about him at the end of the day\nIs a pledge of allegiance just something to say\nI hope not, cuz I love the U.S.A\nDespite of all the drama we have today\nMr. President are you aware?\nOur flesh and blood is dying over there\nWhen the coffins come back, do you care?\nWhen only the poor kids die, is it fair?\n\n[Hook: Wyclef Jean]\nIf I could talk to the President\nWould he pay attention, really listen?\nIf I could talk real intelligent\nWould he beware and then change his position?\nNow is time, time, time\nFor me to speak my mind, mind, mind\n\n[LL Cool J]\nDon't get me wrong, I respect the flag\nBut it hurt to see a kid in a body bag\nHe fought for his country with all he had\nNow he have a family without a dad\nWith a mama crying, the kids is scared\n9/11, why were we unprepared?\nMr. President, are you aware?\nUnless you rich you have poor health care\nMakes you scream and wanna pull out your hair\nDischarged from hospitals as soon as you get there\nMr. President, truth or dare\nTerrorists are hiding, and you know where\nIllegal immigrants are everywhere\nIs it really their fault, they wanted to come here\nI respect you, please be clear\nBut talk with me, show the people you care\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Wyclef Jean]\nWhat am I to do, have you wiggle any you\nTell me something that I just make sense\nYou sent us off to war, please be honest what it's for\nDoes it matter if it's life or death?\n\n[LL Cool J]\nI'm not Republican or Democrat\nI'm independent and I want the facts\nWhen are the soldiers coming back?\nAre we prepared for a terror attack?\nLate at night I watch CNN\nIt gets so bad, I might stop breathing\nThe Middle East hates us, what's the reason?\nMr. President, my heart is bleeding\nTuck my kids in every evening\nTry to teach them to keep believing\nHoping my government won't deceive them\nTell 'em, touch your goals, you could achieve them\nMr. President, I have to know\nIf I die for you, what will I have to show\nWill it really and truly help our country go?\nI'm waiting for your answer, let me know\n\n[Hook 2x]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0c13f17b61fb5401ffd0b607a7ca75ab.500x500x1.jpg", "artist": "LL Cool J", "raw": {"annotation_count": 9, "api_path": "/songs/29011", "apple_music_id": "290279667", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/29011/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "Mr President is the 14th track off LL Cool J\u2019s Exit 13 album, which was his last album on Def Jam Recordings after more than 20 years.

fee\n\u2018Cause these pop melodies ain\u2019t fucking with me\nGet back on your tour bus roll some broccoli\nI'll leave your crew twisted and your hoes knock kneed\nHell through (time) and the game in my speed\n\u2018Cause water down hip hop we do not need\nYes sir, I got the real recipe\nA little bit of old E and bon bon Z\nI guess by now you can tell you miss me\nThe baddest motherfucker in rap history\nOne to the temple put you out your misery\nThat\u2019s not an album , that\u2019s a frisbee\nTangle with LL boy that\u2019s risky\nThem boys is backwash, we want whiskey\n\n[Hook]\n(Jump on it! jump on it!)\nWhen the chips is down you gotta fight for the crown\n(Jump on it! jump on it!)\nTell them boys over there get down or lay down\n(Jump on it! jump on it!)\nI got the house of pain for your little pop clown\n(Jump on it! jump on it!)\nDon\u2019t get it criss cross we\u2019re taking over the town\n\n[Verse 2]\nRoll up on your set pull out the 4 pound\nWho\u2019s pitching out here blast them off the mound\nThe game got us bored, no rebounce\nClaims he\u2019s hardcore how he sound\nMy radio\u2019s a bunch of noise in the background\nFor a factory manufacturing pop clowns\nThat\u2019s what happens when LL ain\u2019t around\nThe pop stars flooding and the hip hop drowns\nDJ suffer while sarada goes round\nYou screaming? got the real creaming\nWelcome to hip hop, we\u2019re out here fiending\nWatch a program directed in the bin and\nWent from cruss group to a boy band screaming\nWhen it come under the car I ain\u2019t leaning\nI wish I could bump the brim creaming\nI tell you what, play my stupid \u2014 call it even\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhat y\u2019all want, no cut!\nWhat y\u2019all need, pure raw\nWhat we do, we sold out\nAll because.. you bought more!\nNo affects on my voice, that\u2019s my choice\nHard raw beat make a soft voice moist\nGet the dinero bring the heat like Jon Voight\nTimbaland music, rolls royce\nHit you in the head like a fat

just don't do that\n\n(LL Cool J)\nI see you in between class and my mind skips a task\nOne glimpse of your eyes and my heart beats fast\nA mysterious fantasy, lovely young queen\nYou\u2019re pose so subtle, just like a magazine\nCome and visit my sister, sit in the livin' room\nEat doughnuts and milk, listen to a pop tune\nUsed to be my babysitter, I want you for my woman\nWithout you girl, my life is bitter like a lemon\nI want you\n\n(LL Cool J)\nI day dream love scenes, girl, when you pass by\nI wonder what the future holds for you and I\nI tell my friends fairy tales about me and you\nMy total devotion for you is true\nSee you on the bus, I trip as I get on\nMy body gets warm but my mind is torn\nI admit you\u2019re the queen of elegance\nMaybe I\u2019m just another puppy love nuisance\nI will tell you straight up, not cologne on a letter\nOpportunity knocks, I feel I just better\nDisappear outta sight, rejection is my fright\nTo me you\u2019re like a drug, boy, a hazy red light\nI want you\n\n(LL Cool J)\nToo weak, I can\u2019t speak, I\u2019m messin' up in school\nJust to hear your name girl, it makes me drool\nAs you sing falsetto on the college choir\nMy temperature level grows much higher\nSpend the night over my house with my sister and friends\nI wish you wouldn\u2019t treat my like I\u2019m your cousin\nYour high school yearbook under my pillow\nYou walk by my window, I see your silhouette\nCandle light is want I desire\nBut all I get to do is fix your flat tire\nWhen you ring my bell purfume I smell\nThe aroma pierces through my heart\u2019s shell\nI tell you that my sister isn\u2019t here today\nYou go away, but I wish you\u2019d stay\nYes, girl, I\u2019m twisted around your finger\nWhen you leave your purfume lingers\nI want you\n\n(LL Cool J)\nThe clock tick-tocks as I lay in my bed\nIt\u2019s visions of you circlin' through my head\nI sip lemon ice tea, read a magazine\nWish we were involved in a steamy love scene\nSaturday night, it\u2019s time to party y'all\nBut an unseen force has my back on the wall\nAll eyes hit the door, red dress shines loud\nThe moment has come, my fantasy\u2019s here now\nYou sip Gin and Tonic with the double hole straw\nFinally I get the nerve to buy you one more\nThe bartender smirks, I whisper \u201cHe\u2019s a jerk\u201d\nI\u2019m wearin' leather pants and a thirty dollar shirt\nOffer you some Double-Mints, sit back, crack a smile\nTry to act like I\u2019m relaxed and not a child\nYou see I\u2019m sixteen and you\u2019re in college\nLovely sweet thing please give me the knowledge\nI want you\n\n(LL Cool J)\nIt\u2019s easy to detect a line that\u2019s preset\nWhat you don\u2019t know is you\u2019re the woman I\u2019ve wanted to get\nFor years and now I\u2019m here sweet dear\nCool as the snow under a polar bear\nI light your cigarette with the Raphael lighter\nYour dress seems like its gettin' tighter and tighter\nThe ice cubes melt, the heat is felt\nThe card\u2019s on the table and my deal is dealt\nI want you\n\n(LL Cool J)\nI had to search through  my soul, cowardice kept a hold on me\nAs the key was analysin' my role\nAs a man to instigate romance\nNot break down and cry when you ask for a dance\nSome fellas talk to her and she walks by\nShe can only say no its not do or die like Bed-Stuy\nIt\u2019s Nature\u2019s way\nA sweet love story from LL Cool J\nI want

J)\nI see you in between class and my mind skips a task\nOne glimpse of your eyes and my heart beats fast\nA mysterious fantasy, lovely young queen\nYou\u2019re pose so subtle, just like a magazine\nCome and visit my sister, sit in the livin' room\nEat doughnuts and milk, listen to a pop tune\nUsed to be my babysitter, I want you for my woman\nWithout you girl, my life is bitter like a lemon\nI want you\n\n(LL Cool J)\nI day dream love scenes, girl, when you pass by\nI wonder what the future holds for you and I\nI tell my friends fairy tales about me and you\nMy total devotion for you is true\nSee you on the bus, I trip as I get on\nMy body gets warm but my mind is torn\nI admit you\u2019re the queen of elegance\nMaybe I\u2019m just another puppy love nuisance\nI will tell you straight up, not cologne on a letter\nOpportunity knocks, I feel I just better\nDisappear outta sight, rejection is my fright\nTo me you\u2019re like a drug, boy, a hazy red light\nI want you\n\n(LL Cool J)\nToo weak, I can\u2019t speak, I\u2019m messin' up in school\nJust to hear your name girl, it makes me drool\nAs you sing falsetto on the college choir\nMy temperature level grows much higher\nSpend the night over my house with my sister and friends\nI wish you wouldn\u2019t treat my like I\u2019m your cousin\nYour high school yearbook under my pillow\nYou walk by my window, I see your silhouette\nCandle light is want I desire\nBut all I get to do is fix your flat tire\nWhen you ring my bell purfume I smell\nThe aroma pierces through my heart\u2019s shell\nI tell you that my sister isn\u2019t here today\nYou go away, but I wish you\u2019d stay\nYes, girl, I\u2019m twisted around your finger\nWhen you leave your purfume lingers\nI want you\n\n(LL Cool J)\nThe clock tick-tocks as I lay in my bed\nIt\u2019s visions of you circlin' through my head\nI sip lemon ice tea, read a magazine\nWish we were involved in a steamy love scene\nSaturday night, it\u2019s time to party y'all\nBut an unseen force has my back on the wall\nAll eyes hit the door, red dress shines loud\nThe moment has come, my fantasy\u2019s here now\nYou sip Gin and Tonic with the double hole straw\nFinally I get the nerve to buy you one more\nThe bartender smirks, I whisper \u201cHe\u2019s a jerk\u201d\nI\u2019m wearin' leather pants and a thirty dollar shirt\nOffer you some Double-Mints, sit back, crack a smile\nTry to act like I\u2019m relaxed and not a child\nYou see I\u2019m sixteen and you\u2019re in college\nLovely sweet thing please give me the knowledge\nI want you\n\n(LL Cool J)\nIt\u2019s easy to detect a line that\u2019s preset\nWhat you don\u2019t know is you\u2019re the woman I\u2019ve wanted to get\nFor years and now I\u2019m here sweet dear\nCool as the snow under a polar bear\nI light your cigarette with the Raphael lighter\nYour dress seems like its gettin' tighter and tighter\nThe ice cubes melt, the heat is felt\nThe card\u2019s on the table and my deal is dealt\nI want you\n\n(LL Cool J)\nI had to search through  my soul, cowardice kept a hold on me\nAs the key was analysin' my role\nAs a man to instigate romance\nNot break down and cry when you ask for a dance\nSome fellas talk to her and she walks by\nShe can only say no its not do or die like Bed-Stuy\nIt\u2019s Nature\u2019s way\nA sweet love story from LL Cool J\nI want you"}}, {"title":

Where's your heart shorty?\nIt's all over, cash your chips in, crack a forty\nYou look thirsty, you ain't gettin' no mercy mercy\nAnd ain't no way that you can rehearse for me\nMurder I wrote, murder I wrote, is what I figure\nIt's in my tote, it's in my tote, so I pull the trigger\nPut up your women, your crib, your speakers\nYour dog, your cat, your crate, your speakers\nYour sister, your aunt, your crew, your Knicks\nGot 'em booin' all you other rappers who think that's too tough\nBam bam, here's a hit you wish you had\nA hit that makes you mad, a hit that makes you slap your dad\nDead dead dead, kill dead, kill dead\nTry to battle me I gots to buck you in your head\nI pull your file, click\nI know you're good to style, blaow\nLivin' wild, when it comes to this I never smile\nWhat did you learn from the lesson I just gave ya?\nObey your mama, be on your best behavior\nIt's never endin' and I am recommendin'\nYou put your name as Brendan\nI see y'all that is blendin'\nThe message that I'm sendin'\nIs there ain't no pretendin'\nGet in the trunk, buy the album, here to end it\n\n[Outro]\nI'm comin'", "image":

night\nYou can call me R&B, that's only if it stands for Rough Brother\nWord to my grandmother\nI buck you in the head just to let ya know\nStick you for ya dough, spit on the flo'\nDrag it out of ya, bring it on\nI smack him back down, yo dope word is bond\nI know you want a piece of the champ\nBut you roll too weak, you couldn't make it in my camp\nYou thought I went for the flip\nBut I'm bustin' off hip-hop clip after clip\nI kept you out there, ripped you for your wear\nJump inside your video, bust you with a chair\nSmack slap smack slap smack slap smack\nJust to make it worse and hurt your pride I'll run it back\nSmack slap smack slap smack slap smack\nClick click boom, stop dead in your tracks\nStick the steel in your mouth\nBuck buck buck buck buck, lights out\n\n[Chorus]\n(\"I'm comin'\")\nHow ya comin' baby?\n(\"I'm comin'\")\nHow ya comin' baby?\nThis is how I'm comin'\n(\"I'm comin'\")\nHow ya comin' baby?\n(\"I'm comin'\")\nHow ya comin' baby?\nThis is how I'm comin'\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe album that I'm comin' with is rough, the flavor's mean\n(ooooh) kickin' you for real in the guillotine\nFourteen shots to your dome kid\nI'm doin' time in the game like a bid\nMovin' rhymes like a package\nSo stigetty step up and get your nostrils damaged\nShootin', lickin', bustin', sprayin', all of that\nAnd then some, dead dead dead, one by one\nNever step to a real man\nCause your rhymes only work on a playground program\nThey impress your little friends, bring you a little ends\nBut you still you gotta ride in your man's Benz\nWord to hip-hop, I'm a blast ya\nGotta set you on fire cause I gassed ya\nBoom, blow, Batman, bang, pow\nUnh (what) unh (what), that's the way it's goin' down\nMy new album ain't no joke\nYou wanna take me out, how many bunch ya smoke?\nI'll never slack again, I'm off the job like the mob\nHey, no prob', many solved, on the knob, make his heartthrob\nWhat you gotta deal with is real, made of steel\nYou can feel it comin', burnin', buildin', flowin' like an eel\nMovin', killin', breakin', servin' you just like a meal\nTake off your clothes and taste the steel\n\n[Chorus]\n(\"I'm comin'\")\nHow ya comin' baby?\n(\"I'm comin'\")\nHow ya comin' baby?\nThis is how I'm comin'\n(\"I'm comin'\")\nHow ya comin' baby?\n(\"I'm comin'\")\nHow ya comin' baby?\nThis is how I'm comin'\n\n[Interlude]\nCheck baby\nCheck baby, yeah\nCheck baby\nCheck baby, uh\nCheck baby\nCheck baby\nCheck baby\nCheck baby\nCheck baby, uh\nCheck baby\nCheck baby\nCheck baby\nCheck baby\nCheck baby, yeah\nCheck baby\nCheck baby\n\n[Verse 3]\nRockabye baby on the rooftop\nOpen up your mouth and taste my Glock\nWhen your jaw breaks your gold teeth will fall\nDown will come the monkey, banana clip and all\nSplat (buck buck buck) it's all over wit'\nAnother plan O.D.'ed over my war hit\nThe way I'm workin' and jerkin' and hurtin' brothers converted\nNon-believers get murdered, that\u2019s how I preferred it\nGet your face out the bill, catch the thrill\nCarry a nine put your hoochies on the bill\nThe thought of you gettin' scarred turns me on\nLike my first television with my backup tip hard\nSo where's your mouth kid? Where's your heart shorty?\nIt's all over, cash your chips in, crack a forty\nYou look thirsty, you ain't gettin' no mercy mercy\nAnd ain't no way that you can rehearse for me\nMurder I wrote, murder I wrote, is what I figure\nIt's in my tote, it's in my tote, so I pull the trigger\nPut up your women, your crib, your speakers\nYour dog, your cat, your crate, your speakers\nYour sister, your aunt, your crew, your Knicks\nGot 'em booin' all you other rappers who think that's too tough\nBam bam, here's a hit you wish you had\nA hit that makes you mad, a hit that makes you slap your dad\nDead dead dead, kill dead, kill dead\nTry to battle me I gots to buck you in your head\nI pull your file, click\nI know you're good to style, blaow\nLivin' wild, when it comes to this I never smile\nWhat did you learn from the lesson I just gave ya?\nObey your mama, be on your best behavior\nIt's never endin' and I am recommendin'\nYou put your name as Brendan\nI see y'all that is blendin'\nThe message that I'm sendin'\nIs there ain't no pretendin'\nGet in the trunk, buy the album, here to end it\n\n[Outro]\nI'm comin'"}}, {"title": "Down the Aisle", "album": "Todd Smith", "year": "2006-04-11",

partner waiting for me at the altar\nMade a vow before God to love me\nAnd finally I'm walking down that aisle\nI will never second guess us how\nWhen we're laughing together, and we're crying together\nHaving kids together, my life begins right now\n\n[LL Cool J]\nFinally the day has arrived\nI'm standing at the altar, you're walking down the aisle\nMy heart skips a beat, emotions run wild\nHalf of me is crying, the other half smiles\nI can feel my stomach turnin and tossin and goin through it\nI just can't believe it, I'm really 'bout to do it\nTake the vow to be together forever\nPlus promise I'ma be there, whenever, wherever\nThrough the ups and downs, through the darkest clouds\nSide by side in the rain 'til the sun comes out\nI was blind to love, God showed me you\nNow I'm standin here shakin 'bout to say \"I do\"\nAnd I do\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[LL Cool J]\nButterflies, my palms are sweaty\nIt's a lifetime commitment, I pray that I'm ready\nBut your eyes tell me not to worry, you're sincere\nCan't turn back now, destiny's why I'm here\nOur friends laugh as I take you by the hand\nBut they single and this a feeling that they don't understand\nYou're my partner for life, I'ma treat you right\nOur honeymoon's forever, not just tonight\nKnew the time was right, to be husband and wife\nUs both dressed alike in the purest white\nSuch a beautiful gown, friends and family around\nIgnore the cold feet now, time to take these vows\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[LL Cool J]\nIt's a beautiful and heavenly day\nAs the pastor asks, \"Who gives this woman away?\"\nYour father says \"I do\" and gives me a hand\nPlus the tough guy, and I completely understand\nHe losin a diamond and now you're mine and\nHe don't have to worry, I'ma keep you shinin\nI'ma build us a future, I'ma keep on climbin\nWith our family on my back, cause that's my assignment\nI'ma work overtime, make sure y'all live\nBut still find time for you and homework with the kids\nTook a long time to learn, I was so hardheaded\nBut you stuck with me and you won't regret it, \"I do\"\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[112] + (LL)\nAnd I do (I do)\nBaby I do (I do)\nBaby I doooooooooooooooooooo\nWe made a vow baby\nI do (I do)\nBaby I do (I do)\nBaby I doooooooooooooooooooo\nFind that perfect partner, yeah yeah (I do)\nWaiting for me at the altar\nAnd I make a vow before God to love you\nFinally I'm walking down that

partner waiting for me at the altar\nMade a vow before God to love me\nAnd finally I'm walking down that aisle\nI will never second guess us how\nWhen we're laughing together, and we're crying together\nHaving kids together, my life begins right now\n\n[LL Cool J]\nFinally the day has arrived\nI'm standing at the altar, you're walking down the aisle\nMy heart skips a beat, emotions run wild\nHalf of me is crying, the other half smiles\nI can feel my stomach turnin and tossin and goin through it\nI just can't believe it, I'm really 'bout to do it\nTake the vow to be together forever\nPlus promise I'ma be there, whenever, wherever\nThrough the ups and downs, through the darkest clouds\nSide by side in the rain 'til the sun comes out\nI was blind to love, God showed me you\nNow I'm standin here shakin 'bout to say \"I do\"\nAnd I do\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[LL Cool J]\nButterflies, my palms are sweaty\nIt's a lifetime commitment, I pray that I'm ready\nBut your eyes tell me not to worry, you're sincere\nCan't turn back now, destiny's why I'm here\nOur friends laugh as I take you by the hand\nBut they single and this a feeling that they don't understand\nYou're my partner for life, I'ma treat you right\nOur honeymoon's forever, not just tonight\nKnew the time was right, to be husband and wife\nUs both dressed alike in the purest white\nSuch a beautiful gown, friends and family around\nIgnore the cold feet now, time to take these vows\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[LL Cool J]\nIt's a beautiful and heavenly day\nAs the pastor asks, \"Who gives this woman away?\"\nYour father says \"I do\" and gives me a hand\nPlus the tough guy, and I completely understand\nHe losin a diamond and now you're mine and\nHe don't have to worry, I'ma keep you shinin\nI'ma build us a future, I'ma keep on climbin\nWith our family on my back, cause that's my assignment\nI'ma work overtime, make sure y'all live\nBut still find time for you and homework with the kids\nTook a long time to learn, I was so hardheaded\nBut you stuck with me and you won't regret it, \"I do\"\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[112] + (LL)\nAnd I do (I do)\nBaby I do (I do)\nBaby I doooooooooooooooooooo\nWe made a vow baby\nI do (I do)\nBaby I do (I do)\nBaby I doooooooooooooooooooo\nFind that perfect partner, yeah yeah (I do)\nWaiting for me at the altar\nAnd I make a vow before God to love you\nFinally I'm walking down that

Mallika\nFeat.

paradise\nStill I can't help but worry\nFor your safety I pay any price\nI'm sorry I didn't recognize your fathers struggle\nBut its hard to be understanding with the amounts of task I juggle\nWhen I think of paradise\nAnd the natural spring flowing\nI get jealous of your father\nFearing your love for him might be growing\n**D\u00f4me \u00e9pais, le jasmin a la rose s\u00b4assemble\nRive en

Mallika\nWhen I held you in my arms\nYour skin was like a rose slightly caressed by the sun\nI chose you before anyone\nWalked through the garden barefoot\nTasting mangoes in the forest\nMy feelings can't be captured by an artist\nIt was beautiful in every heavenly way imagined\nYou're my hero\nFor you Id slay any dragon\nDig tunnels to the depths of my own weakness\nI miss all your grandeur your splendor your sweetness\nYour eloquence fine raiment's sensitivity\nIn a land of thousand paradises\nYou're the epitome\nAnd I'm missing you\nFor love intensifies from yearmin\nI have a smoke filled aura\nFor my insides are burning\nMy love is in your shadows\nMy prayers are always near\nAnd although I live oppressed Mallika\nI have no fear\nFor I know that destiny will cause our paths to cross\nAnd I shall process once more\nThe love I almost lost\nYes, yes\n**Chorus**\nDear Mallika, sweet Mallika\nAs for me sweet Mallika, my country's in upheaval\nMenus hearts have darkened\nSeduced by silent evil\nThey oppress me for colour, class, even religion\nVacuums filled with narcissism sucking up the living\nColonial mentality\nConquerors of peaceful tribes\nI suffocate and grow weary trying to stand in the tide\nBut just knowing that one day Ill have Mallika by my side\nHelps me live on through the storm\nAnd pull the thorns from my side\n**Chorus**\nDear Mallika\nSweet sweet sweet sweet Mallika\nFor an eternity, I shall love you eternally\nWherever you go, my heart goes with you\nIll always love you\nWe will always be one", "image":

return\nAll adversaries should be concerned\nLL Cool J is back again\nAllow me to introduce you to my friend, Cut Creator\n\nHe circumcises DJ's while he's on the airwaves\nTill the missions' complete, you're a musical slave\nIn his division, he'll endure any collision\nLike a surgeon with a scalpel, he'll make an incision\nAs for me I'll annihilate, exile, ex-communicate\nYou from rappin' and my lyrics are the best\nSlow down the rap but not the subject matter\nAll you sucker DJ's will scatter\nCut-Crea-tor will employ techniques that will absorb toy boy\nChoreographer of cuts, Cut Creator is his name\nThe boy's so nice, my vocals will strain\nYou could re-arrange but you don't have the brains\nTo arrange scratch patterns full of audio change\nNot trigonometry, or fundamental geometry\nJust Cool J, that's me, I'm dangerous\n\n(*\"I Need A Beat\" - cut and scratched*)\n\nYeah I made it, don't look astonished\nI had to remind you of what I accomplished\nMy scenario for your stereo\nUs being beat, zero is the ratio\nCut Creator, LL Cool J\nSay \"Ol\u00e9\" to what we display\nBattles, we don't evade, instead we invade\nAnd all competitors will be slayed\nAny comment is a compliment\nNo group's talent could be the equivalent\nOf mine and his combined\nTotal harmony between the cuts and the rhyme\nTurmoil is erased by the depth of the bass\nTakin' out every sucker DJ in the place\nA performance underrated, is now narrated\nSo Cut Creator's social status can be elevated\nHe's dangerous\n\nDemolishin' DJ's in under a second\nI'll quote an old phrase from my last record\nThe beat elevates, the scratch excels\nExcept I came here to raise some hell\nServin up slices and cuts like a blade\nHe could squeeze a dry sponge and make Kool-Aid\nAcute and steady, the record turns steady\nInstead of a needle, he uses a machete\nHis cuts evolve to get you involved\nAs the record revolves, DJ's dissolve\nMusically, physically, mentally, he's an innovator, greater\nCut Creator is on the crossfader\nSo try to digest what I invent\nOn Farmer's Boulevard is where I rest\nI'm numero uno, amigo with an ego\nJe pan de la francais, and Italiano\nFrom my projects and I'll inject\nInto your ears, a new concept\nConceived in silence, to be unveiled\nTo the Cool J phenomena, all must hail\nI'm dangerous"}}, {"title": "I Can Give You More", "album":

I'm here now\nYou'll never be alone long as I'm around\nGood hearts don't belong in the lost and found\nSo, I pick up the pieces, erase your frown\nAnd I show my true colors when we paint the town\nI hate to hear you cry; I don't like the sound\nSo my love is turned up; sheets get turned down\nI know it hurts now; the drama's the worst now\nIt's fourth and a hundred, but love's a first down\nA quarterback to come back right now\nWhen a Hail Mary works, the world is like, \"Wow!\"\nYou down for the count? I ain't having it, baby\nThey can all go to hell, I know they calling me crazy\nBut you're my sunshine when the world gets shady\nA toast to the first lady\n\n[Hook: Fitz & The Tantrums (LL Cool J)]\nYou shouldn't be (You shouldn't be alone) alone (Nah)\nI'm not leaving you tonight\nLove, you know, I'm right here\nI'm not leaving you tonight\n(Fitz and the Tantrums, huh?)\nGo away, baby (That's right)\nI'm not leaving you tonight\nGo away, baby (Uh, uh)\nI'm not leaving you, not leaving you tonight\n\n(Farmer's Boulevard)\n\n[Verse 2: LL Cool J]\nTurn your back on it, and the sun

inclined\nI used to be a Casanova in the lunch room line\nNow there's more important things occupying my mind\nLike being there for you, breathing the air for you\nDo trust falls and truth or dare for you\nThe weight of the world, I'm prepared to bear for you\nThe haters get cynical and call you spoiled\nNot knowing about the drama in which you embroiled\nThe numerous pit falls, the tussle and the toil\nBut farmers taught me to put seeds in the soil\nAnd here comes the harvest; this part's the hardest\nI'm still here regardless\n\n[Hook: Fitz & The Tantrums (LL Cool J)]\nYou shouldn't be (I'm still here, baby) alone\nI'm not leaving you tonight (And you shouldn't be alone)\nLove, you know, (Uh, uh) I'm right here\nI'm not leaving you tonight (Nah, nah)\nGo away, (Yeah) baby\nI'm not leaving you tonight (Uh)\nGo away, baby\nI'm not leaving you, not leaving you tonight\n\n[Bridge: Eddie Van Halen (LL Cool J)]\n(When I'm alone in my room, sometimes, I stare at the wall)\n(And, in the back of my mind, I hear my conscience call)\n(When I'm alone in my room, sometimes, I stare at the wall)\n(And, in the back of my mind, I hear my conscience call)\n\n[Hook: Fitz & The Tantrums (LL Cool J)]\nYou shouldn't be (I'm still here, baby) alone\nI'm not leaving you tonight (And you shouldn't be alone)\nLove, you know, (Uh, uh) I'm right here\nI'm not leaving you tonight (Nah, nah)\nGo

around\nGood hearts don't belong in the lost and found\nSo, I pick up the pieces, erase your frown\nAnd I show my true colors when we paint the town\nI hate to hear you cry; I don't like the sound\nSo my love is turned up; sheets get turned down\nI know it hurts now; the drama's the worst now\nIt's fourth and a hundred, but love's a first down\nA quarterback to come back right now\nWhen a Hail Mary works, the world is like, \"Wow!\"\nYou down for the count? I ain't having it, baby\nThey can all go to hell, I know they calling me crazy\nBut you're my sunshine when the world gets shady\nA toast to the first lady\n\n[Hook: Fitz & The Tantrums (LL Cool J)]\nYou shouldn't be (You shouldn't be alone) alone (Nah)\nI'm not leaving you tonight\nLove, you know, I'm right here\nI'm not leaving you tonight\n(Fitz and the Tantrums, huh?)\nGo away, baby (That's right)\nI'm not leaving you tonight\nGo away, baby (Uh, uh)\nI'm not leaving you, not leaving you tonight\n\n(Farmer's Boulevard)\n\n[Verse 2: LL Cool J]\nTurn your back on it, and the sun still shines\nGrapes get old, and they turn into wine\nThe deeper the roots, the stronger the vines\nThese lines on my face just a sign of the times\nYou could cry on my shoulder if you're so inclined\nI used to be a Casanova in the lunch room line\nNow there's more important things occupying my mind\nLike being there for you, breathing the air for you\nDo trust falls and truth or dare for you\nThe weight of the world, I'm prepared to bear for you\nThe haters get cynical and call you spoiled\nNot knowing about the drama in which you embroiled\nThe numerous pit falls, the tussle and the toil\nBut farmers taught me to put seeds in the soil\nAnd here comes the harvest; this part's the hardest\nI'm still here regardless\n\n[Hook: Fitz & The Tantrums (LL Cool J)]\nYou shouldn't be (I'm still here, baby) alone\nI'm not leaving you tonight (And you shouldn't be alone)\nLove, you know, (Uh, uh) I'm right here\nI'm not leaving you tonight (Nah, nah)\nGo away, (Yeah) baby\nI'm not leaving you tonight (Uh)\nGo away, baby\nI'm not leaving you, not leaving you tonight\n\n[Bridge: Eddie Van Halen (LL Cool J)]\n(When I'm alone in my room, sometimes, I stare at the wall)\n(And, in the back of my mind, I hear my conscience call)\n(When I'm alone in my room, sometimes, I stare at the wall)\n(And, in the back of my mind, I hear my conscience call)\n\n[Hook: Fitz & The Tantrums (LL Cool J)]\nYou shouldn't be (I'm still here, baby) alone\nI'm not leaving you tonight (And you shouldn't be alone)\nLove, you know, (Uh, uh) I'm right here\nI'm not leaving you tonight (Nah, nah)\nGo away, (Yeah) baby\nI'm not leaving you tonight (Uh)\nGo away, baby\nI'm not leaving you, not leaving you tonight\n\n[Outro: LL Cool J]\nFarmer's Boulevard\nQueens"}}, {"title": "New York", "album": "Exit 13", "year": "2008-09-09", "lyrics": "[Intro] (Broadway sample & LL Cool J ad-libs)\nIt's up to you!
