provide everything you need, and I\nLike your smile, I don't want to see you cry\nGot some questions that I got to ask\nAnd I hope you can come up with the answers, babe\n\n[Hook: Nate Dogg]\nGirl, it's easy to love me now\nWould you love me if I was down and out?\nWould you still have love for me?\nGirl, it's easy to love me now\nWould you love me if I was down and out?\nWould you still have love for me?\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nIf I fell off tomorrow, would you still love me?\nIf I didn't smell so good, would you still hug me?\nIf I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century\nCould I count on you to be there to support me mentally?\nIf I went back to a hooptie from a Benz\nWould you poof and disappear like some of my friends?\nIf I was hit and I was hurt, would you be by my side?\nIf it was time to put in work, would you be down to ride?\nI get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive\nI'm askin' questions to find out how you feel inside\nIf I ain't rap \u2018cause I flip burgers at Burger King\nWould you be ashamed to tell your friends you're feelin' me?\nIn the bed, if I used my tongue, would you like that?\nIf I wrote you a love letter, would you write back?\nNow we can have a little drink, you know, a nightcap\nAnd we could go do what you like, I know you like that\n\n[Hook: Nate Dogg]\nGirl, it's easy to love me now\nWould you love me if I was down and out?\nWould you still have love for me?\nGirl, it's easy to love me now\nWould you love me if I was down and out?\nWould you still have love for me?\n\n[Verse 2: 50 Cent]\nWould you leave me if your father found out I was thuggin'?\nDo you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm lovin'?\nAre you mad \u2018cause I'm askin' you 21 questions?\nAre you my soulmate? \u2018Cause if so, girl, you a blessing\nDo you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?\nI'm starin' at you, tryna figure how you got in them jeans\nIf I was down, would you say things to make me smile?\nI'll treat you how you want to be treated, just teach me how\nIf I was with some other chick and someone happened to see\nAnd when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me\nWould you believe me? or up and leave me?\nHow deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?\nWe only humans, girl, we make mistakes\nTo make it up, I'll do whatever it take\nI love you like a fat kid love cake\nYou know my style, I say anything to make you smile\n\n[Hook: Nate Dogg]\nGirl, it's easy to love me now\nWould you love me if I was down and out?\nWould you still have love for me?\nGirl, it's easy to love me now\nWould you love me if I was down and out?\nWould you still have love for me?\n\n[Outro: Nate Dogg]\nCould you love me in a Bentley?\nCould you love me on a bus?\nI'll ask 21 questions and they all about us\nCould you love me in a Bentley?\nCould you love me on a bus?\nI'll ask 21 questions and they all about us"}}, {"title": "In Da Club", "album": "Get Rich or Die Tryin\u2019", "year":

and (Lloyd Banks)]\n(Man, we gotta go get somethin' to eat\nMan, I'm hungry as a motherfucker)\nAyo man, damn\nWhat's takin' homie so long, son?\n(50, calm down, he coming)\n*9 Gunshots*\n(Ahh, ohh, what the fuck)\nAh, son, pull off, pull off)\n\n[Intro: 50 Cent]\nMany men wish death upon me\nBlood in my eye, dawg, and I can't see\nI'm tryin' to be what I'm destined to be\nAnd niggas tryin' to take my life away\nI put a hole in nigga for fuckin' with me\nMy back on the wall, now you gon' see\nBetter watch how you talk when you talk about me\n\u2018Cause I'll come and take your life away\nMany men, many, many, many, many men\nWish death 'pon me\nLord, I don't cry no more\nDon't look to the sky no more\nHave mercy on me\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nNow these pussy niggas puttin' money on my head\nGo on and get your refund, motherfucker, I ain't dead\nI'm the diamond in the dirt that ain't been found\nI'm the underground king and I ain't been crowned\nWhen I rhyme somethin' special happen every time\nI'm the greatest, somethin' like Ali in his prime\nI walk the block with the bundles\nI've been knocked on the humble\nSwing the ox when I rumble, show your ass what my gun do\nGot a temper, nigga, go 'head, lose your head\nTurn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs\nI walk around gun on my waist, chip on my shoulder\n'Til I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nMany men, many, many, many, many men\nWish death 'pon me\nLord, I don't cry no more\nDon't look to the sky no more\nHave mercy on me\nHave mercy on my soul\nSomewhere my heart turned cold\nHave mercy on many men\nMany, many, many, many men\nWish death upon me\n\n[Verse 2: 50 Cent]\nSunny days wouldn't be special if it wasn't for rain\nJoy wouldn't feel so good if it wasn't for pain\nDeath gotta be easy, \u2018cause life is hard\nIt'll leave you physically, mentally and emotionally scarred\nThis is for my niggas on the block twistin' trees in cigars\nFor the niggas on lock doin' life behind bars\nI don't say \"Only God can judge me,\" \u2018cause I see things clear\nCrooked-ass crackers will give my black-ass a hundred years\nI'm like Paulie in Goodfellas, you can call me the Don\nLike Malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm\nSlim switched sides on me, let niggas ride on me\nI thought we was cool, why you want me to die, homie?\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nMany men, many, many, many, many men\nWish death 'pon me\nLord, I don't cry no more\nDon't look to the sky no more\nHave mercy on me\nHave mercy on my soul\nSomewhere my heart turned cold\nHave mercy on many men\nMany, many, many, many men\nWish death upon me\n\n[Verse 3: 50 Cent]\nEvery night I talk to God, but he don't say nothin' back\nI know he protectin' me, but I still stay with my gat\nIn my nightmares niggas keep pullin' TEC's on me\nPsychic says some bitch done put a hex on me\nThe feds didn't know much when Pac got shot\nI got a kite from the pens that told me Tut got knocked\nI ain't gonna spell it out for you motherfuckers all the time\nAre you illiterate, nigga? You can't read between the lines?\nIn the Bible it says what goes around comes around\n\"Hommo\" shot me, three weeks later he got shot down\nNow it's clear that I'm here for a real reason\n\u2018Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fuckin' breathin'\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nMany men, many, many, many, many men\nWish death 'pon me\nLord, I don't cry no more\nDon't look to the sky no more\nHave mercy on me\nHave mercy on my soul\nSomewhere my heart turned cold\nHave mercy on many men\nMany, many, many, many men\nWish death upon me"}}, {"title": "My Life", "album": "Street King Immortal", "year": "2012-11-26", "lyrics": "[Produced by S1]\n\n[Hook: Adam Levine]\nMy life, my life\nMakes me wanna run away\nThere's no place to go\nNo place to go\nAll the confusion\nIt's an illusion, like a movie\nGot nowhere to go\nNowhere to run and hide\nNo matter how hard I try\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nYeah, '03, I went from quite filthy to filthy rich\nMan, their emotions change, so I can never trust a bitch\nI tried to help niggas get on, they turned around and spit\nRight in my face, so Game and Buck both can suck a dick\nNow when you hear 'em it may sound like it's some other shit\n\u2018Cause I'm not writin' anymore, they not makin' hits\nI'm far from perfect, there's so many lessons I done learned\nIf money's evil, look at all the evil I done earned\nI'm doin' what I'm supposed to, I'm a writer, I'm a fighter\nEntrepreneur, fresh out the sewer, watch me maneuver\nWhat's it to ya?

go\nNowhere to run and hide\nNo matter how hard I try\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nYeah, '03, I went from quite filthy to filthy rich\nMan, their emotions change, so I can never trust a bitch\nI tried to help niggas get on, they turned around and spit\nRight in my face, so Game and Buck both can suck a dick\nNow when you hear 'em it may sound like it's some other shit\n\u2018Cause I'm not writin' anymore, they not makin' hits\nI'm far from perfect, there's so many lessons I done learned\nIf money's evil, look at all the evil I done earned\nI'm doin' what I'm supposed to, I'm a writer, I'm a fighter\nEntrepreneur, fresh out the sewer, watch me maneuver\nWhat's it to ya? The track I lace it, it's better than basic\nThis is my recovery, my comeback, kid\n\n[Hook: Adam Levine]\nMy life, my life\nMakes me wanna run away\nThere's no place to go\nNo place to go\nAll the confusion\nIt's an illusion, like a movie\nGot nowhere to go\nNowhere to run and hide\nNo matter how hard I try\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nWhile you were sippin' your own Kool-Aid gettin' your buzz heavy\nI was in the fucking shed, sharpening my machete\nSippin' on some of that revenge juice, getting my taste buds ready\nTo wolf down this spaghetti\nOr should I say this spa-get-even?\nI think you fucking meatballs keep on just forgetting\nThought he was finished, motherfucker, it's only the beginning\nHe's buggin' again, he's straight thuggin', fuck who he's offending!\nHe'll rip your vocal chords out\nAnd have them bitches plugged in the\nMotherfucking wall with 3000 volts of electricity\nNow take the other end of 'em\nThen plug them motherfuckers-in-each one of your eye sockets\n\u2018Cause I thought you might finally fucking see\nThat'll teach you to go voicin' your cocksuckin' opinion to me\nI done put my blood, my sweat and my tears in this shit\nFuck letting up! You\u2019re gonna end up regretting\nYou ever betted against me\nFeels like I'ma snap any minute, yeah, it's happenin' again\nAnd I'm thinking about just saying\n\"Motherfuck everybody that's up in this bitch but 50!\"\n\u2018Cause this is all I know, this is why so hard I go\nI swear to God I put my heart and soul\nIn this more than anybody knows\nI'm trapped, so all I do is rap\nBut everytime I rap I'm more trapped\nAnd I rap myself right to this bubble, oh I guess it's bubble wrap\nIt's like a vicious cycle, my life's in a crisis\nChrist, how was I supposed to know shit would turn up like it did?\nFeels like I'm going psycho again (shh, shh, shh, shh)\nAnd I might just blow my lid\nShit, I almost wish that I would have never made Recovery, kid\n\u2018Cause I'm runnin' in circles with\u2014\n\n[Hook: Adam Levine]\nMy life, my life\nMakes me wanna run away\nThere's no place to go\nNo place to go\nAll the confusion\nIt's an illusion, like a movie\nGot nowhere to go\nNowhere to run and hide\nNo matter how hard I try\n\n[Verse 3: 50 Cent]\nI haven't been this fuckin' confused since I was a kid\nSold like 40 million records, people forgot what I did\nMaybe this is for me, maybe\nMaybe I'm supposed to go crazy\nMaybe I'll do it 3AM in the morning like Shady\nPsycho killer, Michael Myers, I'm on fire like a lighter\nTry to say this ain't classic, get yo' ass kicked mad quick\nWrap your head up in plastic\nPussy, now pick the casket, dirt nap with the maggots\nIt's tragic, it's sad it's never gonna end\nNow we number one again\nWith that frown on your face and your heart full of hate\nAccept it, respect it, this a gift God-given\nLike the air in the lungs of every fuckin' thing livin'\n\n[Hook: Adam Levine]\nMy life, my life\nMakes me wanna run away\nThere's no place to go\nNo place to go\nAll the confusion\nIt's an illusion, like a movie\nGot nowhere to go\nNowhere to run and hide\nNo matter how hard I try"}}, {"title": "Patiently Waiting", "album": "Get Rich or Die Tryin\u2019", "year": "2003-02-06", "lyrics": "[Intro: 50 Cent]\nHey Em, you know you're my favorite white boy, right?\nI owe you for this one\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nI been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on\nYou can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on\nIf it feels like my flow's been hot for so long\nIf you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nI'm innocent in my head, like a baby born dead\nDestination heaven\nSit and politic with passengers from 9/11\nThe Lord's blessings leave me lyrically inclined\nShit, I ain't even got to try to shine\nGod's the seamstress that tailor-fitted my pain\nI got scriptures in my brain, I could spit at your dame\nStraight out the good book, look, niggas is shook\n50 fear no man, warrior, swing swords like Conan\nPicture me, pen in hand, writin' lines\nKnowin' The Source will quote it\nWhen I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it\nI grew up without my pops, should that make me bitter?\nI caught cases, I copped out, does that make me a quitter?\nIn this white man's world I'm similar to a squirrel\nLookin' for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut\nIf I get shot today my phone'll stop ringin' again\nThese industry niggas ain't friends\nThey know how to pretend\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nI been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on\nYou can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on\nIf it feels like my flow's been hot for so long\nIf you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong\nI been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on\nYou can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on\nIf it feels like my flow's been hot for so long\nIf you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong\n\n[Bridge: Eminem]\nIf you're patiently waitin' to make it through all the hatin'\nDebatin' whether or not you can even weather the storm\nAs you lay on the table, they operatin' to save you\nIt's like an angel came to you, sent from the heavens above\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nThey think they're crazy, but they ain't crazy\nLet's face it, shit, basically\nThey're just playin' sick, they ain't shit\nThey ain't sayin' shit \u2014 spray 'em, 50!\nA to the K, get in the way I'll bring Dre and them with me\nAnd turn this day into fuckin' mayhem, you stayin' with me?\nDon't let me lose you, I'm not tryna confuse you\nWhen I let loose with this Uzi\nAnd just shoot through your Isuzu\nYou get the message?

want and yo' ass'll get rolled on\nIf it feels like my flow's been hot for so long\nIf you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nI'm innocent in my head, like a baby born dead\nDestination heaven\nSit and politic with passengers from 9/11\nThe Lord's blessings leave me lyrically inclined\nShit, I ain't even got to try to shine\nGod's the seamstress that tailor-fitted my pain\nI got scriptures in my brain, I could spit at your dame\nStraight out the good book, look, niggas is shook\n50 fear no man, warrior, swing swords like Conan\nPicture me, pen in hand, writin' lines\nKnowin' The Source will quote it\nWhen I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it\nI grew up without my pops, should that make me bitter?\nI caught cases, I copped out, does that make me a quitter?\nIn this white man's world I'm similar to a squirrel\nLookin' for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut\nIf I get shot today my phone'll stop ringin' again\nThese industry niggas ain't friends\nThey know how to pretend\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nI been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on\nYou can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on\nIf it feels like my flow's been hot for so long\nIf you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong\nI been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on\nYou can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on\nIf it feels like my flow's been hot for so long\nIf you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong\n\n[Bridge: Eminem]\nIf you're patiently waitin' to make it through all the hatin'\nDebatin' whether or not you can even weather the storm\nAs you lay on the table, they operatin' to save you\nIt's like an angel came to you, sent from the heavens above\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nThey think they're crazy, but they ain't crazy\nLet's face it, shit, basically\nThey're just playin' sick, they ain't shit\nThey ain't sayin' shit \u2014 spray 'em, 50!\nA to the K, get in the way I'll bring Dre and them with me\nAnd turn this day into fuckin' mayhem, you stayin' with me?\nDon't let me lose you, I'm not tryna confuse you\nWhen I let loose with this Uzi\nAnd just shoot through your Isuzu\nYou get the message? Am I gettin' through to you?\nYou know what's comin'?\nYou motherfuckers don't even know, do you?\nTake some Big and some Pac and you mix 'em up in a pot\nSprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?\nYou got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot\nThe juggernauts of this rap shit, like it or not\nIt's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot\nYou put your life in this, nothin' like survivin' a shot\nY'all know what time it is, soon as 50 signs on this dot\nShit, what you know about death threats, \u2018cause I get a lot\nShady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers\nSome cowards fucked with the wrong building\nThey meant to hit ours\nBetter evacuate all children, it's nuclear showers\nThere's nothin' spookier\nYou now about to witness the power of fuckin' 50\n\n[Hook 2: 50 Cent]\nI been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on\nYou can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on\nIf it feels like my flow's been hot for so long\nIf you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong\nIf the gun squad hearin' all the shots go off\nIt's 50, they say it's 50\nSee a nigga laid out with his fuckin' top blown off\nIt's 50 \u2014 man, that wasn't 50, don't holla my name\n\n[Verse 3: 50 Cent]\nNiggas shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house\nAnd if you got a glass jaw you should watch your mouth\n\u2018Cause I'll break your face\nHave your ass runnin', mumblin' to the jake\nYou goin' against me, dawg, you makin' a mistake, I'll split ya\nLeave you lookin' like the Michael Jackson jackets\nWith all them zippers\nI'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper\nThe way I turn the money over, you should call me flipper\nYour bitch a regular bitch, you callin' her wifey\nI fucked and feed her fast food, you keepin' her icey\nI'm down to sell records but not my soul\nSnoop said this in '94: \"We don't love them hoes.\"\nI got pennies for my thoughts, now I'm rich\nSee the twenties spinnin' lookin' mean on the six\nNiggas wearin' flags \u2018cause the colors match they clothes\nThey get caught in the wrong hood\nAnd filled up with holes, motherfucker\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nI been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on\nYou can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on\nIf it feels like my flow's been hot for so long\nIf you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong\nI been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on\nYou can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on\nIf it feels like my flow's been hot for so long\nIf you thinkin' I'ma

bitch can't get a dollar out of me\nNo Cadillac, no perms, you can't see\nThat I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P\nI don't know what you heard about me\nBut a bitch can't get a dollar out of me\nNo Cadillac, no perms, you can't see\nThat I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P\n\n[Verse 1]\nNow, shorty, she in the club, she dancin' for dollars\nShe got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada\nThat BCBG, Burberry, Dolce and Gabbana\nShe feed them foolish fantasies\nThey pay her, \u2018cause they want her\nI spit a little G, man, and my game got her\nA hour later have that ass up in the Ramada\nThem trick niggas in her ear sayin' they think about her\nI got the bitch by the bar tryin' to get a drink up out her\nShe like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk\nShe from the country\nThink she like me \u2018cause I'm from New York\nI ain't that nigga tryin' to holla \u2018cause I want some head\nI'm that nigga tryin' to holla \u2018cause I want some bread\nI could care less how she perform when she in the bed\nBitch, hit that track, catch a date, and come and pay the kid!\nLook, baby, this is simple, you can't see\nYou fuckin' with me, you fuckin' with a P-I-M-P\n\n[Hook]\nI don't know what you heard about me\nBut a bitch can't get a dollar out of me\nNo Cadillac, no perms, you can't see\nThat I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P\nI don't know what you heard about me\nBut a bitch can't get a dollar out of me\nNo Cadillac, no perms, you can't see\nThat I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm 'bout my money, you see, girl, you can holla at me\nIf you fuckin' with me, I'm a P-I-M-P\nNot what you see on TV, no Cadillac, no greasy\nHead full of hair, bitch, I'm a P-I-M-P\nCome get money with me if you curious to see\nHow it feels to be with a P-I-M-P\nRoll in the Benz with me, you could watch TV\nFrom the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P\nGirl, we could pop some Champagne and we could have a ball\nWe could toast to the good life, girl, we could have it all\nWe could really splurge, girl, and tear up the mall\nIf ever you needed someone I'm the one you should call\nI'll be there to pick you up if ever you should fall\nIf you got problems I can solve 'em, they big or they small\nThat other nigga you be with ain't 'bout shit\nI'm your friend, your father, and confidant, bitch\n\n[Hook]\nI don't know what you heard about me\nBut

and double knowledge of self\nEntrepreneur visions, Moulin Rouge religion\nThat pussy make a weak nigga break down\nSo which you want, the cheese or the cheeks\nYou want the cheeks but she want the cheese, a bitch gotta eat\nI\u2019m havin\u2019 the epiphany you niggas ain\u2019t shit to me\nWorse than the scum in the slum I\u2019m from\nI\u2019m a Southside nigga, yeah I\u2019m \u2018bout

scheme (what else?)\nGuns in your video get you locked in a bing\nYeah, I kill a nigga quick, no worries, my record clean\nMurder one become manslaughter as soon as they brought up\nCharity work, parking tickets and no charges\nFuck nigga you fucked over your father when he gave you a dick\nShould have been a bitch in pajamas\nI made my first million fucking dollars\nBought a Bible, oh yeah, God got me\nMade my second million dollars, bought a chopper and a binocular\nI'm scared, this shit don't happen to everybody\nI'm on Instagram looking at your favorite singer\nDebating on should I fuck her or jump on her single\n20 thou, she got a hell of a adlib\nI'm in her mouth like I knew I could have kids, K-Dot\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent]\nWe on now; we pullin\u2019 off the lot\nBrake hit the

bitch back blown out\nIt's never nothing personal, believe me\nI fuck around, your bitch don't wanna leave me\nShe talking 'bout takin' flights tonight when I'm out of town\nNot around, she want me to fly in to put it down\nIt's nothing to a real nigga, had that ass flying in first class\n'Cause you seem to be regular, she don't want nothing regular\nTurn me on when she talk Spanish, that fat ass\nYou know I wanna get with it, so lady let's get it\n\n[Bridge: 50 Cent]\nToo much on my mind right now\nI'm on the grind right now\nLooking for me, sucker, then I need to be found right now\nI got my nine right now\nBitch, I'll blow your mind right now\nI ain't fucking around right now\nBetter get in line right now\nOr fuck around and die right now\nHope you understand that\n\n[Hook: Sonny Digital]\nBitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man you know I'm the man\nBitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man you know I'm the man\nBitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man you know I'm the man\nBitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man you know I'm the man", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ba09eef1371d0972cfb1c09eab701266.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "50 Cent", "raw": {"annotation_count": 16, "api_path":

came in the world cryin' and fussin'\nNigga, we ain't have nothin'\nEvery ghetto I know the same\nWe trying to make a little change\nPreacher man come around talkin'\nI don't wanna hear it, keep walkin'\nI'ma put the powder in the pot\nWhip it 'till I'm pullin' off a lot\nImagine when I pull it off the lot\nNew shit come without a top\nOnce I'm on I ain't never gon' stop\nBitch, I'm on, I ain't never gon' stop\n\n[Interlude: Sonny Digital]\nI'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man\nI'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man\n\n[Verse 2: 50 Cent]\nAye, came in the game gettin' money\nFlippin' chickens, whip it, gettin' money\nNiggas get to playin' with the money\nClique bang for the money\nShit changed over money\nThey love to see a nigga on the bottom\nCatch it coming, gotta keep it on the low\nA nigga plug bless a nigga with a whole\nWanna break the bitch down into 36 O's\nLooky here, bitch, I'm A-okay\nShorty wanna fuck with me\nStripping, yeah, the jiggy, nigga\nLady, she gon' hit my line\nWe ain't gon' waste no time\nShe sucking and we fucking like she need me\nWhile she make a bankroll easy\nAll the light in the room from the T.V\nWe gettin' it on then I'm gone\nIt's the type of shit that a nigga be on\n\n[Bridge: 50 Cent]\nToo much on my mind right now\nI'm on the grind right now\nLooking for me, sucker, then I need to be found right now\nI got my nine right now\nBitch, I'll blow your mind right now\nI ain't fucking around right now\nBetter get in line right now\nOr fuck around and die right now\nHope you understand that\n\n[Hook: Sonny Digital]\nBitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man you know I'm the man\nBitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man you know I'm the man\nBitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man you know I'm the man\nBitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man you know I'm the man\n\n[Verse 3: 50 Cent]\nI'm a bonafide grade A hustler\nA1, day 1, they can't touch us\nNigga like me, I be with the shit\nTry and stick me I'ma get you hit\nYeah, you know just how I get down\nBad bitches around, they smoking and they drinking\nAnd I'm thinking it can all work out\nSeen your bitch back blown out\nIt's never nothing personal, believe me\nI fuck around, your bitch don't wanna leave me\nShe talking 'bout takin' flights tonight when I'm out of town\nNot around, she want me to fly in to put it down\nIt's nothing to a real nigga, had that ass flying in first class\n'Cause you seem to be regular, she don't want nothing regular\nTurn me on when she talk Spanish, that fat ass\nYou know I wanna get with it, so lady let's get it\n\n[Bridge: 50 Cent]\nToo much on my mind right now\nI'm on the grind right now\nLooking for me, sucker, then I need to be found right now\nI got my nine right now\nBitch, I'll blow your mind right now\nI ain't fucking around right now\nBetter get in line right now\nOr fuck around and die right now\nHope you understand that\n\n[Hook: Sonny Digital]\nBitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man you know I'm the man\nBitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man you know I'm the man\nBitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man you know I'm the man\nBitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man you know I'm the man"}}, {"title": "Candy Shop", "album": "The

don't you stop\nKeep going 'til you hit the spot, whoaa\nI'll take you to the candy shop\nBoy, one taste what I got\nI'll have you spendin' all you got\nKeep going 'til you hit the spot, whoaa\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nYou could have it your way, how do you want it?\nYou gonna back that thing up or should I push up on it?\nTemperature rising, okay, let's go to the next level\nDance floor jam packed, hot as a tea kettle\nI break it down for you now, baby, it's simple\nIf you be a nympho, I be a nympho\nIn the hotel or in the back of the rental\nOn the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into\nGot the magic stick, I'm the love doctor\nHave your friends teasing you about how sprung I got you\nWhen you show me what you working, baby, no problem\nGet on top, get your bounce around like a low rider\nI'm a seasoned vet when it come to this shit\nAfter you work up a sweat, you could play with the stick\nI'm trying to explain, baby, the best way I can\nI melt in your mouth, girl, not in your hand (uh huh)\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent & Olivia]\nI'll take you to the candy shop\nI'll let you lick the lollipop\nGo ahead, girl, don't you stop\nKeep going 'til you hit the spot, whoaa\nI'll take you to the candy shop\nBoy, one taste what I got\nI'll have you spendin' all you got\nKeep going 'til you hit the spot, whoaa\n\n[Bridge: 50 Cent & Olivia]\nGirl, what we do, what we do\nAnd where we do, and where we do\nThe things we do, things we do\nAre just between me and you, yeah, oh yeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 2: 50 Cent]\nGive it to me, baby, nice and slow\nClimb on top, ride like you in a rodeo\nYou ain't never heard a sound like this before\n\u2018Cause I ain't never put it down like this\nSoon as I come through the door\nShe kept pulling on my zipper\nIt's like a race, who can get undressed quicker\nIsn't it ironic, how erotic it is to watch her in thongs?\nHad me thinking about that ass after I'm gone\nI touched the right spot at the right time\nLights on or lights off, she like it from behind\nSo seductive, you should see the way she whine\nHer hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind\nLong as she ain't stoppin', homie, and I ain't stoppin'\nDripping wet with sweat, man, it's on and poppin'\nAll my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle, it's on\nAnd we gonna sip that heavy bubble, man, every bottle is gone\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent & Olivia]\nI'll take you to the candy shop\nI'll let you lick the lollipop\nGo ahead, girl, don't you stop\nKeep going 'til you hit the spot, whoaa\nI'll take you to the candy shop\nBoy, one taste what I got\nI'll have you

you to the candy shop\nI'll let you lick the lollipop\nGo ahead, girl, don't you stop\nKeep going 'til you hit the spot, whoaa\nI'll take you to the candy shop\nBoy, one taste what I got\nI'll have you spendin' all you got\nKeep going 'til you hit the spot, whoaa\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nYou could have it your way, how do you want it?\nYou gonna back that thing up or should I push up on it?\nTemperature rising, okay, let's go to the next level\nDance floor jam packed, hot as a tea kettle\nI break it down for you now, baby, it's simple\nIf you be a nympho, I be a nympho\nIn the hotel or in the back of the rental\nOn the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into\nGot the magic stick, I'm the love doctor\nHave your friends teasing you about how sprung I got you\nWhen you show me what you working, baby, no problem\nGet on top, get your bounce around like a low rider\nI'm a seasoned vet when it come to this shit\nAfter you work up a sweat, you could play with the stick\nI'm trying to explain, baby, the best way I can\nI melt in your mouth, girl, not in your hand (uh huh)\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent & Olivia]\nI'll take you to the candy shop\nI'll let you lick the lollipop\nGo ahead, girl, don't you stop\nKeep going 'til you hit the spot, whoaa\nI'll take you to the candy shop\nBoy, one taste what I got\nI'll have you spendin' all you got\nKeep going 'til you hit the spot, whoaa\n\n[Bridge: 50 Cent & Olivia]\nGirl, what we do, what we do\nAnd where we do, and where we do\nThe things we do, things we do\nAre just between me and you, yeah, oh yeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 2: 50 Cent]\nGive it to me, baby, nice and slow\nClimb on top, ride like you in a rodeo\nYou ain't never heard a sound like this before\n\u2018Cause I ain't never put it down like this\nSoon as I come through the door\nShe kept pulling on my zipper\nIt's like a race, who can get undressed quicker\nIsn't it ironic, how erotic it is to watch her in thongs?\nHad me thinking about that ass after I'm gone\nI touched the right spot at the right time\nLights on or lights off, she like it from behind\nSo seductive, you should see the way she whine\nHer hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind\nLong as she ain't stoppin', homie, and I ain't stoppin'\nDripping wet with sweat, man, it's on and poppin'\nAll my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle, it's on\nAnd we gonna sip that heavy bubble, man, every bottle is gone\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent & Olivia]\nI'll take you to the candy shop\nI'll let you lick the lollipop\nGo ahead, girl, don't you stop\nKeep going 'til you hit the spot, whoaa\nI'll take you to the candy shop\nBoy, one taste what I got\nI'll have you spendin' all you got\nKeep going 'til you hit the spot, whoaa"}}, {"title": "Best Friend", "album": "Get Rich or Die Tryin' Soundtrack",

Ferrari F-50\nBreak it down\nI got a lot of livin' to do before I die\nAnd I ain't got time to waste\nLet's make it\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'\nWe say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'\nYou ain't a friend of mine, you ain't no kin of mine\nWhat makes you think that I won't run up on you with a 9?\nWe do this all the time, right now we on the grind\nSo hurry up and cop and go, we sellin' nicks and dimes\nShorty she so fine, I gotta make her mine\nAn ass like that gotta be one of a kind\nI crush 'em every time, punch 'em with every line\nI'm fuckin' with they mind, I make 'em press rewind\nThey know they can't shine if I'm around to rhyme\nBeen on parole since '94 'cause I commit the crime\nI send you my line, I did a three-to-nine\nIf D's ran up in my crib you know who droppin' dimes\n\n[Hook]\nYou say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'\nWe say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'\nYou go to the dealership, but you never cop nothin'\nYou been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin'\n\n[Verse 2]\nDamn, homie\nIn high school you was the man, homie\nThe fuck happened to you?\nI got the sickest vendetta when it come to the cheddar\nIf you play with my paper you gotta meet my Beretta\nNow shorty think I'ma sweat her sippin' on Amaretto\nI might hit once, then dead her, I know I can do better\nShe look good, but I know she after my cheddar\nShe tryin' to get in my pockets, homie, and I ain't gon' let her\nBe easy, start some bullshit, you get your whole crew wet\nWe in the club doin' the same old two step\nGuerrilla Unit, cuz, they say we bugged out\n'Cause we don't go nowhere without toast, we thugged out\n\n[Hook]\nYou say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'\nWe say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'\nYou go to the dealership, but you never cop nothin'\nYou been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin'\n\n[Bridge]\nMe I'm no mobster, me I'm no gangsta\nMe I'm no hitman, me I'm just me, me\nMe I'm no wanksta, me I'm no actor\nBut it's me you see on your TV\n\n[Verse 3]\n'Cause I hustle, baby, this rap shit is so easy\nI'm gettin' what you get for a brick to talk greasy\nBy any means, partner, I gotta eat on these streets\nIf you play me close for sure I'm gonna pop my heat\nNiggas sayin' they goin' murk 50, how?\nWe ridin' round with guns the size of Lil Bow Wow\nWhat you know about AK's and AR-15's\nEquipped with night vision, shell catchers and inf-beams, huh?\n\n[Hook]\nYou say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'\nWe say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'\nYou go to the dealership, but you never cop nothin'\nYou been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin'"}}, {"title": "Ghetto Qu'ran (Forgive Me)", "album": "Power of the Dollar", "year": null, "lyrics": "[Produced by Trackmasters]\n\n[Chorus]\nLord forgive me, for I've sinned\nOver and over again just to stay on top\nI recall memories, filled with sin\nOver and over, again and again\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhen you hear talk of the Southside, you hear talk of the Team\nSee, niggas feared Prince and respected Preme\nFor all you slow motherfuckers, I'mma break it down iller\nSee, Preme was the business man and Prince was the killer\nRemember, he used to push the bulletproof BM, uh huh\nHis hair'll get you seasick, I sat back and peeped shit\nThe roll with E-Z Wider and they ain't get blunted\nHad the whole projects working for 50 on 500\nAs a youth, all I ever did was sell crack\nI used to idolize Cat\nHurt me in my heart to hear that nigga snitched on Pap\nHow he go out like that?\nRumors in the hood was Just was snitching\nI ain't believe that, pa, he helped me cop my first GSXR\nHad the 4-runner, the Z, the 5 and the 3\nUsed to drive his truck through the hood dragging jet skis\nFrom Gerald Wallace to Baby Wise, don't be surprised\nOf how freely I throw out names of guys who dealt with pies\nLike LA and Wise, L got shot in the neck, then told his connect\nThem niggas who shot them got 'em for ten bricks\nFucking Dominicans, turned around and gave 'em more bricks\n\n[Chorus]\nLord forgive me, for I've sinned\nOver and over again just to stay on top\nI recall memories, filled with sin\nOver and over, again and again\n\n[Verse 2]\nThat first verse is just a dose of the shit that I'm on\nConsider this the first chapter in the ghetto's Qu'ran\nI know a lot of niggas that get dough like Bimmy and Joe\nAnd Prince and Righteous from Hillside with the mole on his nose\nThroughout my struggles in the hood, I started learning\nLife's a bitch with a pretty face, but she burning\nMan I'm a get cheese like Chaz then run through whips like Cigar\nGamble all the time like country-curly head Prince and Tah-Tah\nPo-po under pressure too, they know what they facing\nGo against crews like Bebo and killers like Pappy Mason\nA lot of niggas I know been corrupted since birth\nEnticed to rob nuns for fun, for everything they worth\nI know some cats that held down whole complexes like Corley Wall\nTogether niggas stand and divided they fall\nRound here, shook niggas they keep it in motion\nCome around here with your Roley, you can get robbed like Ocean\nLord knows, Tommy had Laurelton sold\nHelicopters, Rolls Royces with Louis Vuitton interior\nMight sound like I'm fantasizing, but son I'm dead serious\nMontana was no dummy, brought business to wash the money\nHad money out the ass, he politic like the Asian\nFeds couldn't catch him dirty, so settled for tax evasion\n\n[Chorus]\nLord forgive me, for I've sinned\nOver and over again just to stay on top\nI recall memories, filled with sin\nOver and over, again and again\n\n[Verse 3]\nRest in peace to Rich and Ron, money what they was about, yo\nThe twins was from Queens but got crazy cream with Alpo\nThroughout my time I heard tales of Himey, Frenchy\nJamaican Pauly, Duckie Corley\nRonnie Bumps and Chick... shit\nA lot a niggas flow the way I flow\nBut ain't been in the game all their life so don't know who I know\nWriting rhymes is the best way I express how I feel\nIf I ain't rich by 26, I'll be dead or in jail\nComing up I heard sipping too much booze'll leave you confused\nAnd if you watch the news you see players in this game that lose\nI'm forgetting Lefty and Jazz, Pretty Tony and Lance\nHead Lou, Mel son, Troy and E Money Bags\nIn a conversation over shrimp and lobster\nAt Benihana's, heard Chico stopped boxing, and started robbing diners\nShout out to Clarence and Clutch, Bob Dre, Black Will\nIf the flow don't kill you the Mac will", "image":

again\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhen you hear talk of the Southside, you hear talk of the Team\nSee, niggas feared Prince and respected Preme\nFor all you slow motherfuckers, I'mma break it down iller\nSee, Preme was the business man and Prince was the killer\nRemember, he used to push the bulletproof BM, uh huh\nHis hair'll get you seasick, I sat back and peeped shit\nThe roll with E-Z Wider and they ain't get blunted\nHad the whole projects working for 50 on 500\nAs a youth, all I ever did was sell crack\nI used to idolize Cat\nHurt me in my heart to hear that nigga snitched on Pap\nHow he go out like that?\nRumors in the hood was Just was snitching\nI ain't believe that, pa, he helped me cop my first GSXR\nHad the 4-runner, the Z, the 5 and the 3\nUsed to drive his truck through the hood dragging jet skis\nFrom Gerald Wallace to Baby Wise, don't be surprised\nOf how freely I throw out names of guys who dealt with pies\nLike LA and Wise, L got shot in the neck, then told his connect\nThem niggas who shot them got 'em for ten bricks\nFucking Dominicans, turned around and gave 'em more bricks\n\n[Chorus]\nLord forgive me, for I've sinned\nOver and over again just to stay on top\nI recall memories, filled with sin\nOver and over, again and again\n\n[Verse 2]\nThat first verse is just a dose of the shit that I'm on\nConsider this the first chapter in the ghetto's Qu'ran\nI know a lot of niggas that get dough like Bimmy and Joe\nAnd Prince and Righteous from Hillside with the mole on his nose\nThroughout my struggles in the hood, I started learning\nLife's a bitch with a pretty face, but she burning\nMan I'm a get cheese like Chaz then run through whips like Cigar\nGamble all the time like country-curly head Prince and Tah-Tah\nPo-po under pressure too, they know what they facing\nGo against crews like Bebo and killers like Pappy Mason\nA lot of niggas I know been corrupted since birth\nEnticed to rob nuns for fun, for everything they worth\nI know some cats that held down whole complexes like Corley Wall\nTogether niggas stand and divided they fall\nRound here, shook niggas they keep it in motion\nCome around here with your Roley, you can get robbed like Ocean\nLord knows, Tommy had Laurelton sold\nHelicopters, Rolls Royces with Louis Vuitton interior\nMight sound like I'm fantasizing, but son I'm dead serious\nMontana was no dummy, brought business to wash the money\nHad money out the ass, he politic like the Asian\nFeds couldn't catch him dirty, so settled for tax evasion\n\n[Chorus]\nLord forgive me, for I've sinned\nOver and over again just to stay on top\nI recall memories, filled with sin\nOver and over, again and again\n\n[Verse 3]\nRest in peace to Rich and Ron, money what they was about, yo\nThe twins was from Queens but got crazy cream with Alpo\nThroughout my time I heard tales of Himey, Frenchy\nJamaican Pauly, Duckie Corley\nRonnie Bumps and Chick... shit\nA lot a niggas flow the way I flow\nBut ain't been in the game all their life so don't know who I know\nWriting rhymes is the best way I express how I feel\nIf I ain't rich by 26, I'll be dead or in jail\nComing up I heard sipping too much booze'll leave you confused\nAnd if you watch the news you see players in this game that lose\nI'm forgetting Lefty and Jazz, Pretty Tony and Lance\nHead Lou, Mel son, Troy and E Money Bags\nIn a conversation over shrimp and lobster\nAt Benihana's, heard Chico stopped boxing, and started robbing diners\nShout out to Clarence and Clutch, Bob Dre, Black Will\nIf the flow don't kill you the Mac will"}}, {"title":

my mind\nIs contagious, hypnotic, it sounds melodic\nIf rap was the block or a spot, I'd be that potent product\nNow get a load of me, flashy, far from low key\nAnd you can locate me wherever that dope be\nGetting money man\n\n[Chorus]\nI want the finer things in my life\nSo I hustle (Hustle)\nNigga, you get in my way while I'm trying to get mine\nAnd I'll buck you (Buck you)\nI don't care who you run with, or where you from\nNigga, fuck you (Fuck you)\nI want the finer things in my life\nSo I hustle (Hustle)\n\n[Verse 3]\nIt's the Hustler's Ambition, close your eyes, listen see my vision\nMossberg pumpin', shotgun dumpin'\nThe drama means nothing, it's part of the game\nCatch me in the coup\u00e9 switching lanes or in the jeweler switching chains\nI upgrade from dirty \"BS\" to clean VS\nRocks that I copped from proceeds from the spot\nI got the energy to win, I'm full of adrenaline\nPlay the curb and get nauseous, watching the spinners spin\nI made plans to make it, a prisoner of the state\nNow I can invite your ass out to my estate\nThem hollow tips bent me up, but I'm back in shape\nPour Cristal in the blender, make a protein shake\nI'm like the East coast number one playboy B\nHugh Hefner'll tell you he ain't got shit on me\nThe feds watch me, icey, they can't stop me\nRacist, pointing at me, \"Look at Niggaraci\" - hello\n\n[Chorus]\nI want the finer things in my life\nSo I hustle (Hustle)\nNigga, you get in my way while I'm trying to get mine\nAnd I'll buck you (Buck you)\nI don't care who you run with, or where you from\nNigga, fuck you (Fuck you)\nI want the finer things in my life\nSo I hustle (Hustle)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c88daabe96ca5c2f841163e60e9b45e3.892x796x1.jpg", "artist": "50 Cent", "raw": {"annotation_count": 28,

Hustler's Ambition, close your eyes, listen see my vision\nMossberg pumpin', shotgun dumpin'\nThe drama means nothing, it's part of the game\nCatch me in the coup\u00e9 switching lanes or in the jeweler switching chains\nI upgrade from dirty \"BS\" to clean VS\nRocks that I copped from proceeds from the spot\nI got the energy to win, I'm full of adrenaline\nPlay the curb and get nauseous, watching the spinners spin\nI made plans to make it, a prisoner of the state\nNow I can invite your ass out to my estate\nThem hollow tips bent me up, but I'm back in shape\nPour Cristal in the blender, make a protein shake\nI'm like the East coast number one playboy B\nHugh Hefner'll tell you he ain't got shit on me\nThe feds watch me, icey, they can't stop me\nRacist, pointing at me, \"Look at Niggaraci\" - hello\n\n[Chorus]\nI want the finer things in my life\nSo I hustle (Hustle)\nNigga, you get in my way while I'm trying to get mine\nAnd I'll buck you (Buck you)\nI don't care who you run with, or where you from\nNigga, fuck you (Fuck you)\nI want the finer things in my life\nSo I hustle (Hustle)"}}, {"title": "Window Shopper", "album": "Get Rich or Die Tryin' Soundtrack",

me ride by\n\n[Verse 1]\nSummertime, white Porsche Carrera is milky\nI'm on the grind, let my paper stack but I'm filthy\nIt's funny how niggas get to screw-facin' at me\nAnyhow they ain't got the heart to get at me\nI'll get down, Southside's the hood that I come from\nSo I don't cruise through nobody hood without my gun\nThey know the kid ain't gon' fall for all that bullshit\nTry and stick me, I'ma let off a full clip\nIt ain't my fault you done fucked up your re-up\nAt the dice game, who told you put a G up?\nEverybody mad when they paper don't stack right\nBut when I come around y'all niggas better act right\nWhen we got the tops down, you can hear the systems thump\nNigga, when we rollin', rollin', rollin'\nShut your block down, quick to put a hole in a chump\nNigga, when we

scoop me up at LAX and I hop in\nNow when it comes to bad bitches you know I got them\nSome from Long Beach, some from Watts and from Compton\nYou know a nigga wanna see how Cali girls freak off\nAfter that five hour flight from New York\nI start spittin' G at a bitch like a pimp, mane\nTell her, \"Meet me at the Mondrian so we can do our thang.\"\nShe can bring the lingerie with her, I sup-pose\nThen we can go from fully dressed to just havin' no clothes\nThen she can run and tell her best friend 'bout my sex game\nThen her best friend could potentially be next, mane\nListen mane, shit changed, I came up, I'm doin' my thang\nHomie, I'm holdin', holdin', holdin'\nOh shit, mane, the store owner watchin' you\nBefore somethin' get stolen, stolen, stolen\n\n[Chorus]\nNigga, you's a

shit\nMan 1 :  I don't give a fuck. I don't play that shit, and I'm finna' buss a cap in a nigga\nMan 2 : Man, shut the fuck up! Whoa! Slow down, slow down, slow down! You see that brick house right there? That's the nigga's crib. When he come out you gotta tighten his ass up. Imma get in the other car.

Piper picked peppers and Run rocked rhymes\nI'm 50 Cent, I write a little bit, but I pop 9's\nTell niggas get they money right, \u2018cause I got mine\nAnd I'm around, quit playing, nigga, you can't shine\nYou gon' be that next chump to end up in the trunk\nAfter being hit by the pump \u2013 is that what you want?\nBe easy, nigga, I'll lay your ass out\nBelieve me, nigga, that's what I'm about, gangsta\nYou could find a nigga sitting on chrome\nHit the clutch, hit the gear, hit the gas and I'm gone\n\n[Hook]\nIf I can't do it, homie, it can't be done\nNow I'mma let the champagne bottle pop\nI'mma take it to the top\nFor sure I'mma make it hot, baby\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm down for the action, he smart wit' his mouth so smack him\nYou holding a strap, he might come back, so clap him\nReact like a gangsta, die like a gangsta for actin'\n\u2018Cause you'll get hit and homicide'll be asking what happened\nOh no, look who clapped 'em with the .44\n20 inch rims sitting on Low-pro\u2019s\nEastside, Westside, niggas know, yo, I\u2019m loco\nEven my mama said something really wrong with my brain\nNiggas don't rob me, they know I'm down to die for my chain\nG-Unit \u2013 we get it popping in the hood\nG-Unit \u2013 motherfucker, what's good?\nI'm waiting on niggas to act like they don't know how to act\nI had a sip of too much Jack, I'll blow 'em off the map\nWith the MAC, thinking it's all rap, 'til that ass get clapped and Doc say, \"It's a wrap\" (It's a wrap, nigga!)\n\n[Hook]\nIf I can't do it, homie, it can't be done\nNow I'mma let the champagne bottle

fair, I'm dirty-dirty\nI'm from Southside Jamaica, Queens, nigga, ya heard me?\nWhen streetlights come on niggas blast the 9's\nGet locked up, they read books to pass the time\nIn the game there's ups and downs so I stay on the grind\nNiggas on my dick more than my bitch, I stay on they mind\nThere ain't nothing they could do to stop my shine\nThis is God's plan, homie, this ain't mine\nI played the music loud so Grandpa called me a nuisance\nAnd Grandma who always gotta throw in her two cents\nI'm the drop-out who made more money than these teachers\nRoofless like the Coupe, but I come with more features\nI am what I am, you could like it or love it\nIt feels good to blow 50 grand and think nothing of it, fuck it!\n\n[Hook]\nIf I can't do it, homie, it can't be done\nNow I'mma let the

big, rich town\nI just come from the poorest part\nBright lights, city life, I gotta make it\nThis is where it goes down\nI just happen to come up hard\nLegal or illegal, baby, I gotta make it\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nI never took a straight path nowhere, life's full of twist and turns\nBumps and bruises, I live, I learn\nI'm from that city full of yellow cabs and skyscrapers\nIt's hard to get a start in these parts without paper\nHomie, I grew up in hell, a block away from heaven\nThat corner every 15 minutes it move a seven\nPure snow, bag it then watch it go\nOccupational options, get some blow or some hoes\nShoot the bowl or the strap, learn to rap or to jack\nFuck it, man, in the mean time go ahead and pump a pack\nThis my regal royal flow, my James Bond bounce\nThat 007, that 62 on my count\nI'm a undercover liar, I lie under the covers\nLook a bitch in the eyes and tell her ''baby, I love it''\nYou're my inspiration, you're my motivation\nYou're the reason that I'm moving it with no hesitation\n\n[Hook: Joe]\nThey say this is a big, rich town\nI just come from the poorest part\nBright lights, city life, I gotta make it\nThis is where it goes down\nI just happen

school\nOf hard knocks, shots pop, bodies drop\nGraveyard, pick a block cause niggas want your spots\nI'm trying to stack shit then I go legit\nHollow tip, stuff 'em in a clip case niggas trip\nMy cocaine endeavours give me corporate ties\nI'm supposed to lose, watch me win against the odds\nAll I got is my word, balls and my instinct\nI'm trying to make it, we already made it my friends think\nWe already on top, I got a bigger plan\nNo more controlled substances or hand to hand\nWhite collar visions, game changing mission\nBig risks, big wins, equal bigger living\nPerfect position, watch me transition\nFrom caterpillar to butterfly in the sky\n\n[Hook: Joe]\nThey say this is a big, rich town\nI just come from the poorest part\nBright lights, city life, I gotta make it\nThis is

part\nBright lights, city life, I gotta make it\nThis is where it goes down\nI just happen to come up hard\nLegal or illegal, baby, I gotta make it\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nI never took a straight path nowhere, life's full of twist and turns\nBumps and bruises, I live, I learn\nI'm from that city full of yellow cabs and skyscrapers\nIt's hard to get a start in these parts without paper\nHomie, I grew up in hell, a block away from heaven\nThat corner every 15 minutes it move a seven\nPure snow, bag it then watch it go\nOccupational options, get some blow or some hoes\nShoot the bowl or the strap, learn to rap or to jack\nFuck it, man, in the mean time go ahead and pump a pack\nThis my regal royal flow, my James Bond bounce\nThat 007, that 62 on my count\nI'm a undercover liar, I lie under the covers\nLook a bitch in the eyes and tell her ''baby, I love it''\nYou're my inspiration, you're my motivation\nYou're the reason that I'm moving it with no hesitation\n\n[Hook: Joe]\nThey say this is a big, rich town\nI just come from the poorest part\nBright lights, city life, I gotta make it\nThis is where it goes down\nI just happen to come up hard\nLegal or illegal, baby, I gotta make it\n\n[Verse 2: 50 Cent]\nI gotta hustle through the hustle and bust while I make a move\nManuever around the rats and wolves, I'm from the school\nOf hard knocks, shots pop, bodies drop\nGraveyard, pick a block cause niggas want your spots\nI'm trying to stack shit then I go legit\nHollow tip, stuff 'em in a clip case niggas trip\nMy cocaine endeavours give me corporate ties\nI'm supposed to lose, watch me win against the odds\nAll I got is my word, balls and my instinct\nI'm trying to make it, we already made it my friends think\nWe already on top, I got a bigger plan\nNo more controlled substances or hand to hand\nWhite collar visions, game changing mission\nBig risks, big wins, equal bigger living\nPerfect position, watch me transition\nFrom caterpillar to butterfly in the sky\n\n[Hook: Joe]\nThey say this is a big, rich town\nI just come from the poorest part\nBright lights, city life, I gotta make it\nThis is where it goes down\nI just happen to come up hard\nLegal or illegal, baby, I gotta make it"}}, {"title": "Back Down", "album": "Get Rich or Die Tryin\u2019", "year": "2003-02-06", "lyrics": "[Hook]\nIt's easy to see when you look at me\nIf

listen\nYour mami, your papi, that bitch you chasin'\nYour little dirty ass kids, I'll fucking erase them\nYour success is not enough, you wanna be hard\nKnowing that you get knocked you get fucked in the yard\nYou's a Pop Tart, sweetheart, you soft in the middle\nI eat ya for breakfast, the watch was an exchange for your necklace\nAnd your boss is a bitch, if he could he would\nSell his soul for cheap, trade his life to be Suge\nYou can buy cars, but you can't buy respect in the hood\nMaybe I'm so disrespectful cause to me you're a mystery\nI know niggas from ya hood, you have no history\nNever poked nothing, never popped nothing, nigga stop fronting\nJay put you on, X made you hot\nNow you run around like you some big shot\nHa ha, pussy\n\n[Hook]\nIt's easy to see when you look at me\nIf you look closely 50 don't back down\nEverywhere I go both coasts with toast\nEastside, Westside, I hold that mack down\nEvery little nigga you see around me\nHold a gun big enough to fucking hold Shaq down\nNext time you in the hood and see an O.G\nYou ask about me, the young boy don't back down\n\n[Verse 2]\n\"The rap game is all fucked up now, what are we gonna do now?\nHow we gonna eat man? 50 back around\"\nThat's Ja's little punk ass thinking out loud\nSouthside 'til I die, that's just how I get down\nI'm back in the game, shawty, to rule and conquer\nYou sing for hoes and sound like the cookie monster\nI'm the hardest from New York, my flow is bonkers\nAll the other hard niggas they come from Yonkers\nIt's been years and you had the same niggas in the background\nYou never gonna sell Mitsubishi Tah, Crack Child\nThem niggas dead, they just suck, they no good\nI ain't never heard a nigga say they like them in the hood\nI'm back better than ever on top of my game\nEven them country boys saying \"50 we feeling you, mane\"\nNow you stay the fuck outta my zone, outta my throne\nI'm New York City's own bad guy\n\n[Hook]\nIt's easy to see when you look at me\nIf you look closely 50 don't back down\nEverywhere I go both coasts with toast\nEastside, Westside, I hold that mack down\nEvery little nigga you see around me\nHold a gun big enough to fucking hold Shaq down\nNext time you in the hood and see an O.G\nYou ask about me, the young boy don't back down\n\n[Verse 3]\nI ain\u2019t gonna' tell nobody you pussy\nI ain\u2019t gonna' tell nobody you getting extorted\nI've been patiently waiting to blow\nLadies and gentlemen, welcome to \"The 50 Cent Show\"\nThis is my life, my pain, my knife, my gun\nNow that I'm back, you can't sleep, I'm a nightmare, huh?\nYou hired cops to hold you down cause you fear for your life\nBut you heard about them guns I done bought, right?\nI ain't going nowhere, I done told you, nigga\nI'm a G-Unit motherfucking soldier, nigga\n(They not gon' like you)\nI know, I know\n\n[Outro]\nOh no, he didn't say anything about Ja\nOkay? Ja is my boo, okay? Jeffrey Atkins ain't never hurt nobody\nAnd y'all know big thangs come in small packages, holla\nNow everythang was cool until 50 Cent came back into the picture\nThey better not put their hands on Jeffrey\nOkay, first of all, they don't know that I am a 12 degree pink belt\nOkay, I will dice his ass up like a little piece of celery\nOkay, cause see, they don't know me, Delicious, do they know me?\nOkay, I though so\nCause you know that I know karate, and I will see him\nAnd I will Jet Li his ass, hitaaaah!", "image":

me\nIf you look closely 50 don't back down\nEverywhere I go both coasts with toast\nEastside, Westside, I hold that mack down\nEvery little nigga you see around me\nHold a gun big enough to fucking hold Shaq down\nNext time you in the hood and see an O.G\nYou ask about me, the young boy don't back down\n\n[Verse 1]\nAny living thing that cannot co-exist with the kid\nMust cease existing, little nigga, now listen\nYour mami, your papi, that bitch you chasin'\nYour little dirty ass kids, I'll fucking erase them\nYour success is not enough, you wanna be hard\nKnowing that you get knocked you get fucked in the yard\nYou's a Pop Tart, sweetheart, you soft in the middle\nI eat ya for breakfast, the watch was an exchange for your necklace\nAnd your boss is a bitch, if he could he would\nSell his soul for cheap, trade his life to be Suge\nYou can buy cars, but you can't buy respect in the hood\nMaybe I'm so disrespectful cause to me you're a mystery\nI know niggas from ya hood, you have no history\nNever poked nothing, never popped nothing, nigga stop fronting\nJay put you on, X made you hot\nNow you run around like you some big shot\nHa ha, pussy\n\n[Hook]\nIt's easy to see when you look at me\nIf you look closely 50 don't back down\nEverywhere I go both coasts with toast\nEastside, Westside, I hold that mack down\nEvery little nigga you see around me\nHold a gun big enough to fucking hold Shaq down\nNext time you in the hood and see an O.G\nYou ask about me, the young boy don't back down\n\n[Verse 2]\n\"The rap game is all fucked up now, what are we gonna do now?\nHow we gonna eat man? 50 back around\"\nThat's Ja's little punk ass thinking out loud\nSouthside 'til I die, that's just how I get down\nI'm back in the game, shawty, to rule and conquer\nYou sing for hoes and sound like the cookie monster\nI'm the hardest from New York, my flow is bonkers\nAll the other hard niggas they come from Yonkers\nIt's been years and you had the same niggas in the background\nYou never gonna sell Mitsubishi Tah, Crack Child\nThem niggas dead, they just suck, they no good\nI ain't never heard a nigga say they like them in the hood\nI'm back better than ever on top of my game\nEven them country boys saying \"50 we feeling you, mane\"\nNow you stay the fuck outta my zone, outta my throne\nI'm New York City's own bad guy\n\n[Hook]\nIt's easy to see when you look at me\nIf you look closely 50 don't back down\nEverywhere I go both coasts with toast\nEastside, Westside, I hold that mack down\nEvery little nigga you see around me\nHold a gun big enough to fucking hold Shaq down\nNext time you in the hood and see an O.G\nYou ask about me, the young boy don't back down\n\n[Verse 3]\nI ain\u2019t gonna' tell nobody you pussy\nI ain\u2019t gonna' tell nobody you getting extorted\nI've been patiently waiting to blow\nLadies and gentlemen, welcome to \"The 50 Cent Show\"\nThis is my life, my pain, my knife, my gun\nNow that I'm back, you can't sleep, I'm a nightmare, huh?\nYou hired cops to hold you down cause you fear for your life\nBut you heard about them guns I done bought, right?\nI ain't going nowhere, I done told you, nigga\nI'm a G-Unit motherfucking soldier, nigga\n(They not gon' like you)\nI know, I know\n\n[Outro]\nOh no, he didn't say anything about Ja\nOkay? Ja is my boo, okay? Jeffrey Atkins ain't never hurt nobody\nAnd y'all know big thangs come in small packages, holla\nNow everythang was cool until 50 Cent came back into the picture\nThey better not put their hands on Jeffrey\nOkay, first of all, they don't know that I am a 12 degree pink belt\nOkay, I will dice his ass up like a little piece of celery\nOkay, cause see, they don't know me, Delicious, do they know me?\nOkay, I though so\nCause you know that I know karate, and I will see him\nAnd I will Jet Li his ass, hitaaaah!"}}, {"title": "No Romeo No Juliet", "album": "Kanan Reloaded", "year": "2016-05-06",

an S on my chest\nNah, that's a semi-auto, and a vest on my chest\nI try not to say nothing, the DA might want to play in court\nBut I'll hunt a duck nigga down like it's a sport\nFront on me, I'll cut you, gun-butt you or buck you\nYou getting money, I can't get none with ya, then fuck ya\nI'm not the type to get knocked for D.W.I\nI'm the type that'll kill your connect when the coke price rise\nGangstas, they bump my shit, them they know me\nI grew up around some niggas that's not my homies\nHundred G's I stash it, the Mac I blast it\nD's come we dump the diesel in battery acid\nThis flow's been mastered, the ice I flash it\nJux me, I'll have your mama picking out your casket, bastard\nI'm on the next level, Breitling baguette bezel\nBenz pedal to the metal, hotter than a tea

kick, duck quick, it sounds like thunder\nIn December I'll make your block feel like summer\nThe rap critics say I can rhyme, the fiends say my dope is a nine\nEvery chick I fuck with is a dime\nI'm like Patti LaBelle, homie I'm on my own\nWhere I lay my hat is my home, I'm a rolling stone\nCross my path I'll crush ya, thinking I won't touch ya\nI'll have your ass using a wheelchair, cane, or crutches\nIndustry hoes fuck us, in the hood they love us\nStomp a bone out your ass with some brand new Chukkas\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat up, blood?\nWhat up, cuz?\nWhat up, blood?\nWhat up, gangsta?\nWhat

down\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat up, blood?\nWhat up, cuz?\nWhat up, blood?\nWhat up, gangsta?\nWhat up, blood?\nWhat up, cuz?\nWhat up, blood?\nWhat up, gangsta?\n\n[Verse 1]\nThey say I walk around like I got an S on my chest\nNah, that's a semi-auto, and a vest on my chest\nI try not to say nothing, the DA might want to play in court\nBut I'll hunt a duck nigga down like it's a sport\nFront on me, I'll cut you, gun-butt you or buck you\nYou getting money, I can't get none with ya, then fuck ya\nI'm not the type to get knocked for D.W.I\nI'm the type that'll kill your connect when the coke price rise\nGangstas, they bump my shit, them they know me\nI grew up around some niggas that's not my homies\nHundred G's I stash it, the Mac I blast it\nD's come we dump the diesel in battery acid\nThis flow's been mastered, the ice I flash it\nJux me, I'll have your mama picking out your casket, bastard\nI'm on the next level, Breitling baguette bezel\nBenz pedal to the metal, hotter than a tea kettle, blood\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat up, blood?\nWhat up, cuz?\nWhat up, blood?\nWhat up, gangsta?\nWhat up, blood?\nWhat up, cuz?\nWhat up, blood?\nWhat up, gangsta?\n\n[Bridge]\nWe don't play that\nWe don't play that\nWe don't play that (G-Unit)\nWe don't play around\n\n[Verse 2]\nI sit back, twist the best bud, burn and wonder\nWhen gangstas bump my shit, can they hear my hunger?\nWhen the fifth kick, duck quick, it sounds like thunder\nIn December I'll make your block feel like summer\nThe rap critics say I can rhyme, the fiends say my dope is a nine\nEvery chick I fuck with is a dime\nI'm like Patti LaBelle, homie I'm on my own\nWhere I lay my hat is my home, I'm a rolling stone\nCross my path I'll crush ya, thinking I won't touch ya\nI'll have your ass using a wheelchair, cane, or crutches\nIndustry hoes fuck us, in the hood they love us\nStomp a bone out your ass with some brand new Chukkas\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat up, blood?\nWhat up, cuz?\nWhat up, blood?\nWhat up, gangsta?\nWhat up, blood?\nWhat up, cuz?\nWhat up, blood?\nWhat up, gangsta?\n\n[Outro]\nWe don't play that\nWe don't play that\nWe don't play that (G-Unit)\nWe don't play around\nWe don't play that\nWe don't play that\nWe don't play that (G-Unit)\nWe don't play around\nWe don't play that\nWe don't play that\nWe don't play that (G-Unit)\nWe don't play around\nWe don't play that\nWe don't play that\nWe don't

to pray for me and\nI need you to care for me and\nI need you to want me to win\nI need to know where I'm heading cause I know where I've been\nThe flow is bone crushing, it's nothing, I come up with something\nCome through your strip fronting, stunting\nIt's something you want, 745 chrome spinners\nHaters hate that I'm winning\nMan, I've been hot from the beginning\nMotherfuckers envy the kid, control your jealousy\nCause I can't control my temper, I'm finna catch a felony\nPistol in hand, homie, I'm down to get it popping\nOnce I squeeze the first shot you know I ain't stopping\n'Till my clip is empty, I'm simply\nNot that nigga you should try your luck with or fuck with\nHollow-tip shells struck you with your bones broken, guns smoking, still locing\nWhat nigga, lay your ass down, paramedics get you up feeling\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent]\nRight now I'm on the edge so don't push me\nI aim straight for your head so don't push me\nFill your ass up with lead, so don't push me\nI got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy\n\n[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]\nI done lost my bigger nigga and I didn't cry\nToo young to understand the consequences of a man\nLiving a lie, I gotta get that money\nI'll be damned if I'm bummy\nGotta watch my back around these niggas cause they funny\n20 years of watching my mama's tears got me heated, heavily weeded\nSmoking that bong cause I need it\nThese niggas don't want me balling, they want me buried\nBogged in the dirt from shots flurried\nLaying with bugs under my shirt\nI got plans to hop up in that Hummer\nCause I'm a stunner, I sit back and wonder\nWhen them angels gonna call my number\nUnder my chest is a heart of a lion\nI ain't lying, bounty hunters got me flying\nWith my iron, high as a giant\nI'm running from nothing, my stomach is touching what I'm clutching\nTo give you more than a concussion, end of discussion\nMy blood is colder so I'm bolder\nHennessy and soda, hood on my shoulder\nLook in the mirror, I see a soldier\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent]\nRight now I'm on the edge so don't push me\nI aim straight for your head so don't push me\nFill your ass up with lead, so don't push me\nI got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nThese are my ideas, this is my sweat and tears\nThis is shit that I saw with my eyeballs, my ears\nThis is me, who's gotta be what you see on TV\nWhat you hear on CD, what appears easy\nMan these teenie boppers see me on these magazine covers\nIn these beanies and these rags living fantasies\nFronting like it's all fun and games 'til the shoot 'em up bang\nAnd you see your brains hang and you see we ain't playing\nAin't saying we ain't laying down at night and ain't praying\nI bullied my way in this game, man, I'm done playing\nMan, I'm done saying that I'm done playing\nI'mma start laying into these motherfucking cocksuckers\nThere's no way I'ma back down like a god damn coward\nI can't, how would I look as a man bowing to his knees?\nLike the mad cow disease, let somebody lash out at me\nAnd not lash back out at 'em, please\nOh, whoa, yo, ho, hold up, oh no, not me, not Marshall\nYou wanna see Marshall? I'll show you martial\nI try to show you art, but you just pick it apart\nSo I see I have to start, showing you fucking old farts\nA whole other side I wanted to not show you\nSo you know you're not dealing with some fucking marshmallow\nLittle soft yellow, punk pussy, whose heart's Jell-O 'cause\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent]\nRight now I'm on the edge so don't push me\nI aim straight for your head so don't push me\nFill your ass up with lead, so don't push me\nI got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy\n\n[Outro: Tony Yayo]\nShady Aftermath, nigga, G-Unit\nRap juggernauts of this shit,

you to care for me and\nI need you to want me to win\nI need to know where I'm heading cause I know where I've been\nThe flow is bone crushing, it's nothing, I come up with something\nCome through your strip fronting, stunting\nIt's something you want, 745 chrome spinners\nHaters hate that I'm winning\nMan, I've been hot from the beginning\nMotherfuckers envy the kid, control your jealousy\nCause I can't control my temper, I'm finna catch a felony\nPistol in hand, homie, I'm down to get it popping\nOnce I squeeze the first shot you know I ain't stopping\n'Till my clip is empty, I'm simply\nNot that nigga you should try your luck with or fuck with\nHollow-tip shells struck you with your bones broken, guns smoking, still locing\nWhat nigga, lay your ass down, paramedics get you up feeling\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent]\nRight now I'm on the edge so don't push me\nI aim straight for your head so don't push me\nFill your ass up with lead, so don't push me\nI got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy\n\n[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]\nI done lost my bigger nigga and I didn't cry\nToo young to understand the consequences of a man\nLiving a lie, I gotta get that money\nI'll be damned if I'm bummy\nGotta watch my back around these niggas cause they funny\n20 years of watching my mama's tears got me heated, heavily weeded\nSmoking that bong cause I need it\nThese niggas don't want me balling, they want me buried\nBogged in the dirt from shots flurried\nLaying with bugs under my shirt\nI got plans to hop up in that Hummer\nCause I'm a stunner, I sit back and wonder\nWhen them angels gonna call my number\nUnder my chest is a heart of a lion\nI ain't lying, bounty hunters got me flying\nWith my iron, high as a giant\nI'm running from nothing, my stomach is touching what I'm clutching\nTo give you more than a concussion, end of discussion\nMy blood is colder so I'm bolder\nHennessy and soda, hood on my shoulder\nLook in the mirror, I see a soldier\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent]\nRight now I'm on the edge so don't push me\nI aim straight for your head so don't push me\nFill your ass up with lead, so don't push me\nI got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nThese are my ideas, this is my sweat and tears\nThis is shit that I saw with my eyeballs, my ears\nThis is me, who's gotta be what you see on TV\nWhat you hear on CD, what appears easy\nMan these teenie boppers see me on these magazine covers\nIn these beanies and these rags living fantasies\nFronting like it's all fun and games 'til the shoot 'em up bang\nAnd you see your brains hang and you see we ain't playing\nAin't saying we ain't laying down at night and ain't praying\nI bullied my way in this game, man, I'm done playing\nMan, I'm done saying that I'm done

talk for me, my whip talk for me\nMy gat talk for me, blow, what up, homie?\nEven bitches who don't know me, they wanna blow me\nCause the shit I floss with is saying a lot for me\n\n[Verse 1]\nI came in the rap humble, I don't give a fuck now\nI'll serve anybody like niggas who hustle uptown\nCoke price go up, capsules come down\nThe D's run in my crib, I'm nowhere to be found\nNiggas who hustle for me they don't even stash tracks\nThey keep it on 'em, right there in they ass crack\nWhen I don't like a nigga, I don't pretend to\nI'll have the paramedics wrap your fucking head like a Hindu\nLook, I ain't going nowhere so get used to me\nOG's look at me and see I'm what they used to be\nI'm that nigga that sold coke, the nigga that sold dope\nThe nigga that shot dice, went broke and sold soap\nThe thug that pop shit, the thug that pop clips\nThe thug that went from three and a half to a whole brick\nNigga ain't in his right mind going against me\nMy picture's painted the

shit?\nIt's that green tongue, Cali bud\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris\nTanqueray and Alize, I don't need shit\nNigga, I'm high all the time, I smoke that good shit\nI stay high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit\nGive me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate\nGive me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit\nAnd stay high all the time, I smoke that good shit\nI'm high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit\n\n[Verse 1]\nEvery time I roll up, niggas holla \"Roll up!\"\nAnd I tell 'em hold up, you ain't getting money, you ain't smoking\nIn my Benzo, 20 inch Lorenzo's\nSmoking on indo, high as a motherfucker\nI be on them backstreets, niggas know I clap heat\nOnly if you got beef, man, you better holla at me\nNiggas get locked up, stabbed up, shot up\nEvery time I pop up, a lot going on in my hood\nI shoot the dice, I holla get 'em Girls\nDaddy need new shoes\nDaddy need Pirellis to look mean on 22's\nStash box, Xbox, laptop, fax machine, phone\nBulletproof this bitch and I'm gone\n2003 Suburban swerving, too many sips of Henny\nThe D's sick, they searched the whip and they can't find the semi's\nThey was just harassing me cause they know who I was\nSpent the night in Central Booking for smoking some bud\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris\nTanqueray and Aliz\u00e9, I don't need shit\nNigga, I'm high all the time, I smoke that good shit\nI stay high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit\nGive me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate\nGive me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit\nAnd stay high all the time, I smoke that good shit\nI'm high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit\n\n[Bridge]\nNow if you heard I done started some shit\nIt ain't because I be high, be high\nAnd if you heard I done let off a clip\nIt ain't because I be high, be high\nBut I twist that lye, lye lye lye\n\n[Verse 2]\nI get high as I wanna, nigga\nGo against me, for sure, you's a goner, nigga\nI don't smoke to calm my nerves, but I got beef\nFinna crush my enemies like I crush the hashish\nIf you love me, tell me you love me, don't stare at me, man\nI'd hate to be in the pen for clapping one of my fans\nLet me show you how to greet me, when you meet me, when you see me\nIf you real, my nigga, you know how to holla \"G-Unit!\"\nThere's no competition, it's just me\n50 Cent, motherfucker, I'm hot on these streets\nIf David could go against Goliath with a stone\nI can go at Nas and Jigga, both for the throne\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris\nTanqueray and Aliz\u00e9, I don't need shit\nNigga, I'm high all the time, I smoke that good shit\nI stay high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit\nGive me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate\nGive me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit\nAnd stay high all the time, I smoke that good shit\nI'm high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow, who you know besides me, who write lines and squeeze nines\nAnd have hoes in the hood sniffing on white lines\nYou don't want me to be your kid's role model\nI'll teach them how to buck them .380's and load up them hollows\nHave shorty fresh off the stoop, ready to shoot\nBig blunt in his mouth, deuce-deuce in his boot\nSit in the crib sipping Guinness watching Menace, then oh Lord\nHave a young nigga bucking shit like he O-Dog\nMy team they depend on me when it's crunch time\nI eat a nigga food in broad day like it's lunchtime\nYou feeling brave nigga? Go ahead, get gully\nSee if I won't leave your brains leaking up out your skully\nI done made myself hot, so, ain't shit you can tell me\nNow niggas calling me to feature, man, fuck your money\nI ain't hurting, I'm aight, nigga, I'm doing good\nI ain't gotta write rhymes, I got bricks in the hood\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris\nTanqueray and Aliz\u00e9, I don't need shit\nNigga, I'm high all the time, I smoke that good shit\nI stay high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit\nGive me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate\nGive me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit\nAnd stay high all the time, I smoke that good shit\nI'm high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit\n\n[Outro]\nG-Unit, are you ready?

Rapper & 50 Cent]\nYo, yo, yo, yo, you know who this is boy\nThe art of getting robbed\nThis is how we do Brooklyn-style, boy, you know what I'm saying?\nR.I.P B.I.G - nigga R.I.P P.A.C - R.I.P\nEnough of that shit, it's time to O.D, one time\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nThe bottom line is I'm a crook with a deal\nIf my record don't sell I'mma rob and steal\nYou better recognize, nigga, I'm straight from the street\nThese industry niggas is starting to look like something to eat\nI'll snatch Kim and tell Puff, ''You want to see her again?\nGet your ass down to the nearest ATM''\nI have dreams of fucking an R&B bitch\nBut I wake up early and bounce with all her shit\nWhen I apply pressure, son, it ain't even funny\nI'm about to stick Bobby for some of that Whitney money\nBrian McKnight, I can get that nigga anytime\nHave Keith sweating staring down the barrel on my nine\nSince these Harlem World niggas seem to all be fam\nI put the gun to Cardan, tell him, \"Tell your man\"\nMason Betha, haha\nCome up off that watch now, I mean right now\nThe only excuse for being broke is being in jail\nAn entertainer can't make bail, he broke as hell\nI'd rob ODB, but that'd be a waste of time\nProbably have to clap him, run and toss the nine\nI'd follow Fox in the drop for four blocks\nPlotting to jux her for that rock Kurupt copped\nWhat, Jigga just sold like four milli, got something to live for\nDon't want a nigga putting four through that Bentley Coupe door\nI'll manhandle Case like \"Dope, get on the ground\nYou ain't with Mary no mo', where you getting chips from now?\"\nI been scheming on Tone and Poke since they found me\nSteve know not to wear that platinum shit around me\nI'm a klepto, nah for real, son, I'm sick\nI'm bout to stick Slick Rick for all that old school shit\nRight now I'm bent and when I get like this I don't think\nAbout to make Stevie J take off that tight ass mink\nI'll rob Pun without a gun, snatch his piece then run\nThis nigga weigh 400 pounds, how he gonna catch me, son?\n\n[Hook: The Madd Rapper]\nThis ain't serious\nBeing broke can make you delirious\nSo we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger\n50 Cent, how it feel to rob an industry nigga?\nThis ain't serious\nBeing broke can make you delirious\nSo we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger\n50 Cent, how it feel to rob an industry nigga?\n\n[Verse 2: 50 Cent]\nI'll catch P and Silkk the Shocker right after the Grammys\nAnd Will Smith and Jada ass down in Miami\nRun up on Timbaland and Missy with the pound\nLike, \"You, give me the cash; you, put the hot dog down\"\nI figured it out, niggas been robbing Joe before\nThat's why his ass don't wanna be a player no more\nMy attitude while robbing J.D.? \"Fuck you, pay me!\"\nHad Da Brat with em, should've had his gat with him\nDMX wanna get down, well, you tell, homie\nI'm on that Treach shit, I do my dirt all by my lonely\nI should rob Clue, man, his shit did well\nI wanna stick TQ, but his shit ain't sell\nI hit the studios, take niggas' jewels and leave\nCatch Rae, Ghost, and RZA for them funny ass rings\nTell Sticky give me the cash before I empty three\nI'll beat your ass like that white boy on MTV\nCanibus wanna battle while I'm sticking him up\nFuck the cab, the coroners picking 'em up\nHeavy tried to hide his shit, hey nigga I saw you\nHe said \"Why you robbing me? I got nothing but love for ya\"\nCaught Juvenile for his Cash Money piece\nTold him I want it all, he said, \"Even my gold teeth?\"\nI caught Blackstreet on a back street in a black Jeep\nOne at a time, get out and take off your shine\nDid you ever think that you would be this rich?\nDid you ever think that you would have these hits?\nDid you ever think that I'd flash the nine?\nAnd walk off with your shit like it's mine?\nI'mma keep sticking niggas until I'm living\nI'll rob Boyz II Men like I'm Michael Bivins\nCatch Tyson for half that cash like Robin Givens\nI'm hungry for real, I'm about to stick Mister Cee\nThat nigga still eating off Big's first LP\nI had Busta and the whole Flipmode on the floor\nHe asked me if I had enough, I told him, \"Gimme some more\"\nIs you feeling this? Then wait for the sequel\nI gotta get Kirk Franklin for robbing God's people\n\n[Hook: The Madd Rapper]\nThis ain't serious\nBeing broke can make you delirious\nSo we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger\n50 Cent, how it feel to rob an industry nigga?\nThis ain't serious\nBeing broke can make you delirious\nSo we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger\n50 Cent, how it feel to rob an industry nigga?\n\n[Outro: The Madd Rapper]\nFor real, yo, you know what I'm saying?\nNiggas got to get stuck up, that's just how it goes down\nIt don't matter if you an industry nigga or a regular nigga or a bitch\nIt don't matter if you got it and I need it I want it\nYou know what I'm saying? That's just how it go down\n50 Cent ain't fucking around, Trackmasters ain't fucking around\nCrazy Cat ain't fucking around, The Madd Rapper ain't fucking around\nYou know what I'm saying?\nSo watch your backs, watch your pocket book, watch your pockets\nWatch everybody on the train, watch everybody on the bus\nCause we gonna get you whether you like it or not"}}, {"title": "I'll Whip Ya Head Boy", "album": "Get Rich or Die Tryin' Soundtrack", "year": null, "lyrics": "[Hook: 50 Cent]\nI'll Whip Your Head Boy, you know I will\nI'll Whip Your Head Boy, with the back of the steel\nI'll Whip Your Head Boy, your cap could get peeled\nI'll Whip Your Head Boy, your ass could get killed\n\nI'll Whip Your Head Boy, you know I will\nI'll Whip Your Head Boy, with the back of the steel\nI'll Whip Your Head Boy, your cap could get peeled\nI'll Whip Your Head Boy, your ass could get killed\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\n2 niggas in the front, 2 niggas in the back\nThats 4 niggas ridin' strapped in grandpa's Cadillac\nThe voice in my head say fuck all these niggas\nThen I start thinkin', I should rob all these niggas\nMan my homies then wan' do whatever I wan' do\nI say I wan' eat they say shit we wan' eat too\nLet's ride around find a nigga stuntin' on front street\nWith the shine's on niggas be lookin' like lunch meat\nI run up on a nigga, pop one on the floor\nTell um come up off that shit 'fore we start poppin' some more\nFuck a ski mask, man, niggas know who I is\nI got a full clip and niggas know I get biz\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nI'll Whip Your Head Boy, you know I will\nI'll Whip Your Head Boy, with the back of the steel\nI'll Whip Your Head Boy, your cap could get peeled\nI'll Whip Your Head Boy, your ass could get killed\n\nI'll Whip Your Head Boy, you know I will\nI'll Whip Your Head Boy, with the back of the steel\nI'll Whip Your Head Boy, your cap could get peeled\nI'll Whip Your Head Boy, your ass could get killed\n\n[Verse 2: 50 Cent]\nI'm up early in the mornin', tryna make a move\nWe come in here with me shorty take your lil' on the school\nEven though she cause the drama, you love your baby momma\nI hit her with the llama to get this cake\nGive us the coke, the cash, the combo to the safe\nBut she don't know it, damn, OK we'll wait\nI play with your kid on the couch, while your bitch on the phone\nPut a gun to her head sayin' daddy come home\nYou was rollin' poppin' bubbly, didn't think it get ugly\nIn the hood shit is lovely until it go bad\nNow you can pray for a miracle and God might be hearin' you\nThat the nine will jam right in my hand\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nI'll Whip Your Head Boy, you know I will\nI'll Whip Your Head Boy, with the back of the steel\nI'll Whip Your Head Boy, your cap could get peeled\nI'll Whip Your Head Boy, your ass could get killed\n\nI'll Whip Your Head Boy, you know I will\nI'll Whip Your Head Boy, with the back of the steel\nI'll Whip Your Head Boy, your cap could get peeled\nI'll Whip Your Head Boy, your ass could get killed\n\n[Verse 3: Young Buck]\nI got his homies screamin' Buck you need to calm down\nNiggas be gettin' killed everytime you come around\nWe ran up in his crib, made his momma kiss the ground\nShe askin' God, what my baby done did now?\nI'm takin' everything, jewellery I want it all\nDuct tape him up, rip the phone cords out the wall\nFuck waitin' we gon' starve waitin' on tomorrow\nSo ask Satan if he got a car that I can borrow\nI'm impatient like a money hungry rap star\nI jack him for his chain and I can get a new Jaguar\nThe mack I have his brains all over the fuckin' sidewalk\nAnd I'mma be on CNN again it ain't my fault\nMarch nigga step, right nigga left\nG-Unit soldier I'm thuggin' till my death\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nI'll Whip Your Head Boy, you know I will\nI'll Whip Your Head Boy, with the back of the steel\nI'll Whip Your Head Boy, your cap could get peeled\nI'll Whip Your Head Boy, your ass could get killed\n\nI'll Whip Your Head Boy, you know I will\nI'll Whip Your Head Boy, with the back of the steel\nI'll Whip Your Head Boy, your cap could get peeled\nI'll Whip Your Head Boy, your ass could get killed\n\n[Verse 4: Billy Danze]\nWOO!!!

to get this cake\nGive us the coke, the cash, the combo to the safe\nBut she don't know it, damn, OK we'll wait\nI play with your kid on the couch, while your bitch on the phone\nPut a gun to her head sayin' daddy come home\nYou was rollin' poppin' bubbly, didn't think it get ugly\nIn the hood shit is lovely until it go bad\nNow you can pray for a miracle and God might be hearin' you\nThat the nine will jam right in my hand\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nI'll Whip Your Head Boy, you know I will\nI'll Whip Your Head Boy, with the back of the steel\nI'll Whip Your Head Boy, your cap could get peeled\nI'll

on niggas\nI'm an apex predator, nigga, I'm stronger\nShooters on deck, I break bread and they on ya\nNiggas said I fell off, oh, you heard I fell off?\nWhy the fuck would you be repeating that?\nNigga, I'm a rap tycoon, make a 100 mill by June\nNow who the fuck said I can't rap, Jay?\nI'm in a dope fiend's dream, I got it for 'em raw\nI got that morphine memories, I've been breaking

was kilos and gangbanging\nThen the homie taught me to whip, gamechanging\nNow I'm breaking down birds on the coffee table\nYeah, and half them bitches sold 'fore they off the table\nGotta look, nigga wantin' my half, I\u2019m gonna split it\nThe type of nigga work that visit like it's a skillet\nLess Soda, more water, stretching like it's elastic\nWeigh it up in 250's, wrap it up in plastic,

in them same ol' clips\nIn the projects, niggas fuck with the same ol' chicks\nFor somehow, they still think that they game is so sick\nNow from the rip, niggas know I'm 'bout my grip\nI don't trick, man I barely even feed a bitch\nShe say I'm stingy, I say, \"I don't need you bitch\"\nGo 'head leave, see if I chase you, shit!\nTell yo' mammy, I catch her in the streets I'mma get her\nShe know I'm on parole, why she call police on a nigga?\nShe just mad, cause a nigga pockets on swole\nWhen she ask to borrow some, I say, \"Hell naw!\"\nI was tellin' the lil' homies all about this shit\nTo keep yo' mind on yo' money\nAnd don't trust no bitch\nKe Ke hit high notes, when them pigs came\nBut her ass kinda fat, so niggas treat' her the same\nThis is real\n\n[Chorus]\nListen lil' homie, when it

man, that shit for the birds\nCharlie drunk, drinkin' wild irish rose on the curb\nI know a spot full of niggas tryin' to bet a few bucks\nHopin' they number come out, they can have 'em some luck\nTo

deal\n\n[Chorus]\nListen lil' homie, when it rains it pours\nHollow tips and talons, when it rains it pours\nGet caught in lead showers just because\nNiggas ain't playin', when it rains it pours\nNiggas get set up, when it rains it pours\nEnd up wet up, that's when it rains it pours\nIt usually, goes down over money and whores\nBut lil' homie in my hood, when it rains it pours\n\n[Verse 1]\nAin't nothin' changed, niggas doin' the same ol' shit\nThem new hollow tips in them same ol' clips\nIn the projects, niggas fuck with the same ol' chicks\nFor somehow, they still think that they game is so sick\nNow from the rip, niggas know I'm 'bout my grip\nI don't trick, man I barely even feed a bitch\nShe say I'm stingy, I say, \"I don't need you bitch\"\nGo 'head leave, see if I chase you, shit!\nTell yo' mammy, I catch her in the streets I'mma get her\nShe know I'm on parole, why she call police on a nigga?\nShe just mad, cause a nigga pockets on swole\nWhen she ask to borrow some, I say, \"Hell naw!\"\nI was tellin' the lil' homies all about this shit\nTo keep yo' mind on yo' money\nAnd don't trust no bitch\nKe Ke hit high notes, when them pigs came\nBut her ass kinda fat, so niggas treat' her the same\nThis is real\n\n[Chorus]\nListen lil' homie, when it rains it pours\nHollow tips and talons, when it rains it pours\nGet caught in lead showers just because\nNiggas ain't playin', when it rains it pours\nNiggas get set up, when it rains it pours\nEnd up wet up, that's when it rains it pours\nIt usually, goes down over money and whores\nBut lil' homie in my hood, when it rains it pours\n\n[Verse 2]\nBlood stains on my stoop, when Akbar got shot\nWhen homocide outside, nigga I'm not\nThis the third time them niggas done circled the block\nIt's money out now yeah, but damn it's hot\nThey'll love to catch a nigga, on a direct sale\nThey say, \"tell us who caught the body, or you goin' to jail\"\nLook, if you know the drill you stay the fuck outta dodge\nAnd say what's happenin' to the captain\nAnd say what's up to the sarge\nFuck bein' in a cage man, that shit for the birds\nCharlie drunk, drinkin' wild irish rose on the curb\nI know a spot full of niggas tryin' to bet a few bucks\nHopin' they number come out, they can have 'em some luck\nTo Ace to the duece, and stumbled off mad\nLost his re-up money man, that's all he had\nMagazine from the store, so he can look at the cars\nAnd do pull up's in the park, on the monkey bars\nMad as fuck\n\n[Chorus]\nListen lil' homie, when it rains it pours\nHollow tips and talons, when it rains it pours\nGet caught in lead showers just because\nNiggas ain't playin', when it rains it pours\nNiggas get set up, when it rains it pours\nEnd up wet up, that's when it rains it pours\nIt usually, goes down over money and whores\nBut lil' homie in my hood, when it rains it pours\n\n(Gun shots, police sirens and helicopters going off\nWhile it thunders and rains)"}}, {"title": "U Not Like Me",

son\n[click click] you heard that? That mean run\nAsk around, I ain't the one you wanna stunt on, pa\nPull through, I throw a fucking cocktail at ya car\nFrom the last shootout I got a dimple on my face\nIt\u2019s nothing, I can go after Mase\u2019s fan base\nShell hitted my jaw, I ain't wait for doctor to get it out\nHit my wisdom tooth [huck-too] spit it out\nI don't smile a lot 'cause ain't nothin' pretty\nGot a purple heart

wanna know me\nFrom 3 point range with a Glock, I shoot better than Kobe\nSee a nigga standing next to me, he probably my Co-D\nSee a bitch getting in my whip, she probably gon' blow me\nSee the flow is like a .38, it\u2019s special y'all\nA country boy tell 'ya \"I\u2019m a finna to blow\"\nI\u2019m more like a pimp than a trick, you know\nYou see, I\u2019m in this for the paper, but I don\u2019t

phones\nWhen the gossipin' start, I'm always the topic\nYou too old for that shit, dawg, won\u2019t you stop it?\nShorty, I've been watching, you watching me\nNow tell me what you like more, my watch or me?\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you get shot and run to the cops, you not like me\nYou ain't got no work on the block, you not like me\nIt's hot, you ain't got no drop, you not like me\nLike me, dude, you not

LAPD, NYPD\n\n[Verse 1]\nNiggas wanna shine like me (Me)\nRhyme like me (Me)\nThen walk around with a 9 like me (Me)\nThey want to do it 3 to 9 like me\nAnd they ain't strong enough to take 9 like me\nAyo, you think about shittin' on fifty, save it\nMy songs belong in the Bible with King Davids\nI teach niggas sign language, that ain\u2019t deaf, son\n[click click] you heard that? That mean run\nAsk around, I ain't the one you wanna stunt on, pa\nPull through, I throw a fucking cocktail at ya car\nFrom the last shootout I got a dimple on my face\nIt\u2019s nothing, I can go after Mase\u2019s fan base\nShell hitted my jaw, I ain't wait for doctor to get it out\nHit my wisdom tooth [huck-too] spit it out\nI don't smile a lot 'cause ain't nothin' pretty\nGot a purple heart for war and I ain't never left the city\nHoes be like \"Fiddy, you so witty\"\nOn the dick like they heard I ghostwrite for P.Diddy\nYou got fat while we starve, it's my turn\nI done felt how the shells burn, I still won't learn\nWon't learn\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you get shot and run to the cops, you not like me\nYou ain't got no work on the block, you not like me\nIt's hot, you ain't got no drop, you not like me\nLike me, dude, you not like me\nIf you get shot and run to the cops, you not like me\nYou ain't got no work on the block, you not like me\nIt's hot, you ain't got no drop, you not like me\nLike me, dude, you not like me\n\n[Verse 2]\nMama said everything that happened to us, was part of God's plan\nSo at night when I talk to him I got my gun in my hand\nDon't think I'm crazy cause I don't fear man\nCause I fear when I kill a man God won't understand\nI got a head full of evil thoughts, am I Satan?\nI been could've killed these niggas, I'm still waitin'\nIn the telly with two whores, Benz with two doors\n32 karats in the cross, no flaws\nYou see me in the hood, I got at least two guns\nI carry the Glock, Tony Carry, my M-1\nHold me down, nigga, OGs tryin' to rock me\nD's waiting for my response to lock me\nThis is my hustle, nigga, don't knock me\nYou need some shit with a banana clip to try and stop me\nI'm the one\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you get shot and run to the cops, you not like me\nYou ain't got no work on the block, you not like me\nIt's hot, you ain't got no drop, you not like me\nLike me, dude, you not like me\nIf you get shot and run to the cops, you not like me\nYou ain't got no work on the block, you not like me\nIt's hot, you ain't got no drop, you not like me\nLike me, dude, you not like me\n\n[Verse 3]\nSee, I done been to the Pearly Gates, they sent me back\nGood die young, I ain't eligible for that\nI shot niggas, I been shot, sold crack in the street\nMy attitude is gangsta, so I stand some beef\nYou wanna get acquainted with me, you wanna know me\nFrom 3 point range with a Glock, I shoot better than Kobe\nSee a nigga standing next to me, he probably my Co-D\nSee a bitch getting in my whip, she probably gon' blow me\nSee the flow is like a .38, it\u2019s special y'all\nA country boy tell 'ya \"I\u2019m a finna to blow\"\nI\u2019m more like a pimp than a trick, you know\nYou see, I\u2019m in this for the paper, but I don\u2019t love the hoes\nNiggas broke in the hood worryin' about mines\nGrown ass men wearing starter kit shines\nYou know 'em little pieces with the little stones\nGot little clientele fiends call your cell phones\nWhen the gossipin' start, I'm always the topic\nYou too old for that shit, dawg, won\u2019t you stop it?\nShorty, I've been watching, you watching me\nNow tell me what you like more, my watch or me?\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you get shot and run to the cops, you not like me\nYou ain't got no work on the block, you not like me\nIt's hot, you ain't got no drop, you not like me\nLike me, dude, you not like me\nIf you get shot and run to the cops, you not like me\nYou ain't got no work on the block, you not like me\nIt's hot, you ain't got no drop, you not like me\nLike me, dude, you not like me"}},

no wrong\nShe said, \u201cyou mommy little man,\u201d I said, \u201cyep, uh huh\u201d\nShe was everything to me, when she came, I just lit up\nSunday morning I was so sharp, all did up\nIt was welfare or hustlin', they killed her for that\nThe first shot, bullet wound in my back\nI\u2019m fucked up, look at my sneakers, I\u2019m fucked up\nNow I\u2019m on my own, mommy gone\nSam said, \u201cyou a young boy, why your clothes look so old?\nYou don\u2019t need fish, little nigga, you need a pole\nYou need no new kicks, you need an O\u201d\nChop that, bag it, get right back at it\nThat touched me, it hit me in my heart\nI\u2019m a hustler, homie, you was giving me my start\nI am what I am, Sabrina\u2019s only baby\nPracticing in the mirror, pulling out my .380\nOh man, I fucked up nana gonna kill me\nWhenever shit can go wrong it always will, see\nSeven grams of cocaine, three grams of dope\nSaint Mary medallion hanging from my rope\nTry to punk me and my gun smoke\nLook, I\u2019m outta control, my gun go\nOff like it\u2019s legal, call the cops, you need to\nGive \u2018em my description, I ain\u2019t bullshittin'\nMy high school sweetheart love didn\u2019t last long\nNiggas start flashing that bread and she was gone\nThat hurt me like the bullet in my calf then\nMy next girl was a pain in the ass\nI got two shots left, in case niggas try to get me\nThat\u2019s nine shots, we just call it Fifty\n\n[Outro]\nMama said the Lord gon\u2019 bless us\nMama said, mama said\nMama said the Lord gon\u2019 bless us\nThen in came the landlord, beef, and the stresses\nMama said the Lord gon\u2019 bless us\nMama said, mama said\nMama said the Lord gon\u2019 bless us\nThe dope bought the shit the food stamps couldn\u2019t get us\nMama said the Lord gon\u2019 bless us\nThat\u2019s what mama said, that's what mama said"}}, {"title": "New Day", "album": null, "year": "2012-07-30", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nIt don\u2019t take much strength to pull a trigger\nBut try to get up every morning

Dre]\nI woke up this morning thinking \u2019bout the old me\nWhen I was feeling like Miller Lite and Ol' E\nBut now I ride on some conscious shit\nI\u2019m getting bread while I toast to my accomplishments\nOnly one I could have a problem with is myself\nThat\u2019s probably why my only competition is myself\nFrom today to tomorrow the Doc is just rocking the same drum\nFuck the past, though I ain\u2019t forgot where I came from\nI got the club rocking, uh\nI got your girl jocking, uh\nMe and Fif\u2019 still in this bitch, bitch\nWe goin' the distance witchu party people, come

to be on top\nI said, me I get to be on top\nI got the street on lock\nI\u2019m on automatic pilot, ain't nobody stopping me\nGrowing up in poverty ain't fill my heart with larceny\nNiggas ride, I don\u2019t hide, I dump to get 'em off of me\nI\u2019m a leader, look and see the natural born boss of me\nThey from Bel Air, I\u2019m from the bottom\nSoon as I spot \u2018em I get to drop \u2018em\nI got \u2018em; the competition, red-dot 'em\nIt\u2019s dinner time when the 9 come out\nIt\u2019s off with the chain, off with the ring\nMove, bang, off with ya brain\n\n[Chorus: Alicia

I\u2019d get rich or die trying\nI did it, good luck sucker, trying to stop my shine\nNothing matters but the music, music my first love\nWe paper chasing -- I\u2019m always coming in first,

who\u2019s the real tough guy\nThe working man is a tough guy\n\n[Chorus: Alicia Keys]\nParty people say, party people say\nAy it\u2019s a new day, it\u2019s a new day\nWorld is getting ready, everybody ready, yeah!\nFor a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say\nA-A-A-A-A-A-A-Aye\n\n[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]\nI woke up this morning thinking \u2019bout the old me\nWhen I was feeling like Miller Lite and Ol' E\nBut now I ride on some conscious shit\nI\u2019m getting bread while I toast to my accomplishments\nOnly one I could have a problem with is myself\nThat\u2019s probably why my only competition is myself\nFrom today to tomorrow the Doc is just rocking the same drum\nFuck the past, though I ain\u2019t forgot where I came from\nI got the club rocking, uh\nI got your girl jocking, uh\nMe and Fif\u2019 still in this bitch, bitch\nWe goin' the distance witchu party people, come on\n\n[Chorus: Alicia Keys]\nParty people say, party people say\nAyy\nIt\u2019s a new day\nIt\u2019s a new day\nWorld is getting ready, everybody ready, yeah!\nFor a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say\nA-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ayy\n\n[Verse 2: 50 Cent]\nNow, you can get your knees on the church floor, pray it get\ufeff better\nOr push the dough on the liquor store, see where it get ya\nBut me, I got to be on top\nI said, me I get to be on top\nI got the street on lock\nI\u2019m on automatic pilot, ain't nobody stopping me\nGrowing up in poverty ain't fill my heart with larceny\nNiggas ride, I don\u2019t hide, I dump to get 'em off of me\nI\u2019m a leader, look and see the natural born boss of me\nThey from Bel Air, I\u2019m from the bottom\nSoon as I spot \u2018em I get to drop \u2018em\nI got \u2018em; the competition, red-dot 'em\nIt\u2019s dinner time when the 9 come out\nIt\u2019s off with the chain, off with the ring\nMove, bang, off with ya brain\n\n[Chorus: Alicia Keys]\nParty people say, party people say\nAy it\u2019s a new day, it\u2019s a new day\nWorld is getting ready, everybody ready, yeah!\nFor a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say\nA-A-A-A-A-A-A-Aye\n\n[Bridge: Alicia Keys]\nMarks on the wall\nIt\u2019s now or never at all\nI\u2019m gonna give it my all\nWhether I rise or fall\n\n[Verse 3: 50 Cent]\nTrue story, I said I\u2019d get rich or die trying\nI did it, good luck sucker, trying to stop my shine\nNothing matters but the music, music my first love\nWe paper chasing -- I\u2019m always coming in first, cuz\nI\u2019m built for it, see I\u2019m better under pressure\nI react like a maniac when I\u2019m coming to get ya\nI got to win, Em watch and Dre watch and my son watching\nFuck that, losing ain't an option\nI\u2019m sharp I\u2019m on point\nThe ink from my ballpoint\nThrowing out my pain\nI\u2019m back on my A-game\nI\u2019m focused, for me this is just another victory\nExcept that I\u2019m stronger than an ox now mentally\n\n[Chorus: Alicia Keys]\nParty people say, party people say\nAy it\u2019s a new day, it\u2019s a new day\nWorld is getting ready, everybody ready, yeah!\nFor a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say\nA-A-A-A-A-A-A-Aye"}}, {"title": "Places to Go", "album": "8 Mile: Music from and Inspired by

to this\nNow throw it up, raise it up for that gangsta shit\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm in my Lambo, maggot, my fo' fo' faggot\nDoors lift up, I'm like Go Go Gadget\nSee the shit I got on, homie, I'd hate too\nMy Teflon on, boy, my government issue\nI'll hit your vertebrae, bullets rip through tissues\nYour wife on the futon hugging that Shih Tzu\nHomie, you a bitch, you got feminine ways\nHeard you got four lips and bleed for seven days\nI got fo' fifths and bananas on the K's\nAnd got more whips than a runaway slave\nMe and Yayo go back like some high top fades\nWhen I made fifty mill, Em got paid\nWhen I made sixty mill, Dre got paid\nWhen I made eighty mill, Jimmy got paid\nI ain't even gotta rap now, life is made\nSaid I ain't even gotta rap, I'm filthy, mane\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm laughing straight to the bank with this\n(Ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI keep nothing but hundred dollar bills in the bank roll\nI got the kind of money that the bank can't hold\nGot it off the street movin bundles and O's\nSeventy Three Caprice old school when I roll\nBreeze pass with the E-Pass, fuck the toll\nNo more platinum, I'm wearing gold\nI'm internationally known, it's the kid with the flow\nThat brings enough dough, it's never enough though\nShit I need mo', new shit out the sto'\nBaby blue was old, fresh off the flo'\nStashbox by the dashbox in case they want war\nMake the purple bring the green in, fuck the law\nI'm oh so raw, I'm hot, I'm sure\nI'm like the coolest motherfucker around the globe, boy\nI set the club on fire I told ya\nI'm the general; salute me soldier\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm laughing straight to the bank with this\n(Ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)\n\n[Outro]\nNow work it out now, shorty work it out\nI wanna see you, break it down\nNow back it up now, you know what I'm about\nIt's like a bank job I'm in and I'm out\nNow work it out now, work it out, work it out\nNow work it out now, work it out, work it out"}}, {"title":

was just tryna make it\nA brown sheepskin on, niggas was tryna' take it\nYou know the kind of drama that come with the leather bomber\nNiggas try to jump you gotta stay with the lama\nSuckers shit

nothing\nYeah\nNow Lamborghinis and Porsches we stunting\nLook at me now nigga\nPull up, get your bitch, in drop top we roll out\nY'all niggas ain't shit\nThey all act like they ain't know bet they know now\nI'm up nigga\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nIf I ever said fuck you nigga I meant to\nWhen you come up how I came up, life's not gentle\nSee that tear in my mama eye, that meant the rent due\nI prayed on it, God didn't say nothing back\nSaw that cocaine you had, we turned it to crack\nHad a couple grams of diesel, we was just tryna make it\nA brown sheepskin on, niggas was tryna' take it\nYou know the kind of drama that come with the leather bomber\nNiggas try to jump you gotta stay with the lama\nSuckers shit niggas get shot over some nah, nah\nIf niggas want problems I'm sayin' this no problem\nI catch 'em on the late night and dearly depart 'em\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]\nLook back\nLook where we started from\nIt's all the beginning\nThey ain't tell me why we come this far\nNow they feel it in the air\nWhen it's 2AM and the sky is filled with stars\nDriving down the boulevard\nI remember when...\n\n[Chorus: Jeremih & 50 Cent]\nThey used to tell me that I wouldn't be

know now\nI'm up nigga\n\n[Verse 2: 50 Cent]\nI remember all the shit you said to me 'cause it hurt me\nThen it helped me 'cause then I was down to do the dirt\nSee the knots in my pockets boy, I go the cash route\nI see you with your skinny jeans, punk, with your ass out\nAnd I got all kind of money now\nLook what you made me\nGot a different type of temper, man a nigga get crazy\nMy A.P. look like I done dipped it in water, hard\nLike me when I done dipped in your daughter (GOD!)\nFrom playin' with Hot Wheels to collecting cars\nThat shit in the duPont REGISTRY's in my yard\nSomehow the bullshit shifted\nNow the motherfuckers calling me gifted\nAnd I be like\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]\nLook back\nLook where we started from\nIt's all the beginning\nThey ain't tell me why we come this

Ayy you know where them niggas be at right?\nTake me to 'em\n\n[Chorus]\nAll through the hood I keep hearin' niggas sayin'\nI'm supposed to die tonight\nNiggas done put a hit out and they talkin' like the shit okay\nI'm gonna ride tonight\nWe rollin', whip stolen, AK loaded\nI'm gonna ride tonight\nWe smokin', straight loc'n, lockin' loadin'\nSomebody gon' die tonight\n\n[Verse 1]\nThis is not new, I been in this position before\nGrandma crib, niggas outside of her door\nDifferent day same shit, old mac new clip\n32 hollow-tips, gloves, no rubber grip\nI'm a boss, but niggas never show no respect\nI catch 'em slippin', I'll have 'em tongue-kissin' my tec\nGo on, come, test me, pussy boy, don't try it\nPolice response never fast enough to shots fired\nDon't be stupid, find out who you fuckin with son\n'Fore we find out where yo' bitch get her hair and nails done\nIt's elementary, life is but a dream\nYou know row row your boat, your blood forms a stream\nAfter you get hit, you shoulda thought about the shit\nYou took that paper you take a life or yo' life get took bitch\nSometimes I sit and look at life from a different angle\nDon't know if I'm God's child or I'm Satan's angel\n\n[Chorus]\nAll through the hood I keep hearin' niggas sayin'\nI'm supposed to die tonight\nNiggas done put a hit out and they talkin' like the shit okay\nI'm gonna ride tonight\nWe rollin', whip stolen, AK loaded\nI'm gonna ride tonight\nWe smokin', straight loc'n, lockin' loadin'\nSomebody gon' die tonight\n\n[Verse 2]\nIn 2002, if you asked me to make a wish\nI simply woulda wished that my music would be a hit\nBig said, \"Damn - niggas wanna stick me for my paper\nAnd pray for my downfall,\" I understand it all\nBut me, I'm a little more flashy a nigga\nSo chances are, I'ma have to blast me a nigga\nI'm on that Kevlar vest shit, that Wild Wild West shit\nThere's eighty-one one karat stones in my necklace\nI shine so hard, I make motherfuckers wan' kill me\nEvery projects in every hood I go, they feel me\nKnow it sounds like rap, but this shit is real B\nI don't talk that rich shit, but nigga I'm filthy\nWhen I come out to play, and my mob ain't with me\nYou can bet your bottom dollar that revolver with me\nHomeboy, frontin' on me'll shorten your lifespan\nHold the mic with my left, my knife in my right hand\nYEAH!\n\n[Chorus]\nAll through the hood I keep hearin' niggas sayin'\nI'm supposed to die tonight\nNiggas done put a hit out and they talkin' like the shit okay\nI'm gonna ride tonight\nWe rollin', whip stolen, AK loaded\nI'm gonna ride tonight\nWe

Cent]\nComin up I was confused, my mommy kissin a girl\nConfusion occurs comin up in the cold world\nDaddy ain't around, probably out commitin felonies\nMy favorite rapper used to sing, \"Check check out My Melody\"\nI wanna live good, so shit I sell dope\nFor a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes\nNana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat\nIf I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope\nTossed and turned in my sleep that night\nWoke up the next mornin, niggas had stole my bike\nDifferent day, same shit, ain't nothin' good in the hood\nI'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent & The Game]\nHate it or love it, the underdog's on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop\nGo 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP\nAnd I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me\nHate it or love it, the underdog's on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop\nGo 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP\nAnd I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me\n\n[Verse 2: The Game]\nI told Dre from the gate \"I'd carry the heat for ya\"\nFirst mixtape song I inherited beef for ya\nGritted my teeth for ya, G-G-G-G for ya\nPut Compton on my back when you in need of soldiers\nAt my last show I threw away my N.W.A. gold\nI had the whole crowd yellin \"Free Yayo!\"\nSo niggas better get up outta mine\nFor I creep and turn your projects into Columbine\nAnd I'm rap's MVP\nDon't make me remind y'all what happened in D.C\nThis nigga ain't Gotti, he pretend\nMad at us cause Ashanti got a new boyfriend\nAnd it seems your lil' rat turned out to be a mouse\nThis beef shit is for the birds and the birds fly South\nEven Young Buck can vouch, when the doubts was out\nWho gave the West coast mouth-to-mouth?\nHahaha\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent & Lloyd Banks]\nHate it or love it, the underdog's on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop\nGo 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP\nAnd I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me\nHate it or love it, the underdog's on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop\nGo 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP\nAnd I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me\n\n[Bridge: 50 Cent]\nFrom the beginnin to the end, losers lose, winners win\nThis is real we ain't got to pretend\nThe cold world that we in, is full of pressure and pain\nI thought it would change, it's stayin' the same\n\n[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]\nHow many of them boys is witcha'\nWhen you had that little TV you had to hit on to get a picture\nI'm walking with a snub, cause niggas do a lot of slick talkin\nIn the club 'til they coughin on the rug\nAin't never had much but a Walkman and a bud\nMy role model is gone snortin up his drug\nBad enough they want me to choke, my boy just got poked in the throat\nNow it's an RIP shirt in my coat\nNow I'm speedin, reminiscin\nHoldin my weed in, never listen\nIf I see him I'mma lift 'em\nAnd maybe that'll even the score\nBut if not, it'll be me on the floor\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent & Tony Yayo]\nHate it or love it, the underdog's on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop\nGo 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP\nAnd I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me\nHate it or love it, the underdog's on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop\nGo 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP\nAnd I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me\n\n[Verse 4: Tony Yayo]\nI started out at 15, scared as hell\nI took 30 off a pack and made them sales\nAs a youth, man I used to hustle for loot\nWith that lil deuce-deuce and my triple fat goose\nSippin Easy Jesus, rockin a leases\nMy momma whipped me when she found my pieces\nI look back on life and thank God I'm blessed\nWe the best on the planet so forget the rest\n\n[Verse 5: Young Buck]\nYou know I'm still nice with my cook game\nLook man, it's a hood thang; that's why I'm loved in Brook-lyn\nI handle mine just like a real nigga should\nIf I do some time homey, I'm still all good\nLet me show you what a thug bout, born to die\nI took the bullets outta 50 put 'em in my fo'-five\nAnd I ain't even got my feet wet yet\nA seven figure nigga who ain't seen a royalty check\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent & Young Buck]\nHate it or love it, the underdog's on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop\nGo 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP\nAnd I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me\nHate it or love it, the underdog's on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop\nGo 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP\nAnd I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me", "image":

out commitin felonies\nMy favorite rapper used to sing, \"Check check out My Melody\"\nI wanna live good, so shit I sell dope\nFor a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes\nNana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat\nIf I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope\nTossed and turned in my sleep that night\nWoke up the next mornin, niggas had stole my bike\nDifferent day, same shit, ain't nothin' good in the hood\nI'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent & The Game]\nHate it or love it, the underdog's on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop\nGo 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP\nAnd I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me\nHate it or love it, the underdog's on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop\nGo 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP\nAnd I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me\n\n[Verse 2: The Game]\nI told Dre from the gate \"I'd carry the heat for ya\"\nFirst mixtape song I inherited beef for ya\nGritted my teeth for ya, G-G-G-G for ya\nPut Compton on my back when you in need of soldiers\nAt my last show I threw away my N.W.A. gold\nI had the whole crowd yellin \"Free Yayo!\"\nSo niggas better get up outta mine\nFor I creep and turn your projects into Columbine\nAnd I'm rap's MVP\nDon't make me remind y'all what happened in D.C\nThis nigga ain't Gotti, he pretend\nMad at us cause Ashanti got a new boyfriend\nAnd it seems your lil' rat turned out to be a mouse\nThis beef shit is for the birds and the birds fly South\nEven Young Buck can vouch, when the doubts was out\nWho gave the West coast mouth-to-mouth?\nHahaha\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent & Lloyd Banks]\nHate it or love it, the underdog's on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop\nGo 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP\nAnd I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me\nHate it or love it, the underdog's on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop\nGo 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP\nAnd I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me\n\n[Bridge: 50 Cent]\nFrom the beginnin to the end, losers lose, winners win\nThis is real we ain't got to pretend\nThe cold world that we in, is full of pressure and pain\nI thought it would change, it's stayin' the same\n\n[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]\nHow many of them boys is witcha'\nWhen you had that little TV you had to hit on to get a picture\nI'm walking with a snub, cause niggas do a lot of slick talkin\nIn the club 'til they coughin on the rug\nAin't never had much but a Walkman and a bud\nMy role model is gone snortin up his drug\nBad enough they want me to choke, my boy just got poked in the throat\nNow it's an RIP shirt in my coat\nNow I'm speedin, reminiscin\nHoldin my weed in, never listen\nIf I see him I'mma lift 'em\nAnd maybe that'll even the score\nBut if not, it'll be me on the floor\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent & Tony Yayo]\nHate it or love it, the underdog's on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop\nGo 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP\nAnd I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me\nHate it or love it, the underdog's on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop\nGo 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP\nAnd I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me\n\n[Verse 4: Tony Yayo]\nI started out at 15, scared as hell\nI took 30 off a pack and made them sales\nAs a youth, man I used to hustle for loot\nWith that lil deuce-deuce and my triple fat goose\nSippin Easy Jesus, rockin a leases\nMy momma whipped me when she found my pieces\nI look back on life and thank God I'm blessed\nWe the best on the planet so forget the rest\n\n[Verse 5: Young Buck]\nYou know I'm still nice with my cook game\nLook man, it's a hood thang; that's why I'm loved in Brook-lyn\nI handle mine just like a real nigga should\nIf I do some time homey, I'm still all good\nLet me show you what a thug bout, born to die\nI took the bullets outta 50 put 'em in my fo'-five\nAnd I ain't even got my feet wet yet\nA seven figure nigga who ain't seen a royalty check\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent & Young Buck]\nHate it or love it, the underdog's on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop\nGo 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP\nAnd I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me\nHate it or love it, the underdog's on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop\nGo 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP\nAnd I ain't goin'

get my drink on and party like it's ok\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nTrust me man it's ok, bounce with me in slow mo\nWhen they hear the kid in the house they're like, \"Oh no\"\n50 got 'em locin again, they open again\nGot 'em sipping on that juice and gin\nYou could find me in the background burning that Backwood\nStyling and stunting, doing my two step fronting\nNow I'mma tell you what Em told me, homey\nJust lose the parental discretion's advised, this is grown folk music\nNow blend in with me, as I proceed to break it down\nIt's always off the chain man when I'm around\nI play the block bumping, it was all for the dough\nI get the club jumping, cause I'm sick with flow\nYou know it's sold out, like wherever I go\nI jam packed the show man that's for sure\nI got the info you already know\nMan I get it popping in the club, everybody show me love, let's go\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nYou, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control\nQuit playing turn the music up a little bit\nBounce with me now shorty let's get into it\nYou, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control\nQuit playing turn the music up a little bit\nBounce with me now homey let's get into it\n\n[Verse 2: Havoc]\nYou wanna search me for certain but hurry up cause I'm thirsty\nI need that, grind in my system P, on my side twisting\nIn the club today for the chick to go both\nWays, let me see that ID just for proof\nWith the drink til the burn is gone\nHit the dancefloor like a scene from soft porn\nBefore it pop, make em sign a disclaimer\nTry to get me on some Pac shit these tricks will frame ya\nBut, in any event, keep fucking with 50 it makes sense\nCents, into them dollars, the hoes wanna holler\nBut you lookin at a nigga that done came from the squalor\nNow my buddy so gone I can pop your collar\nNow If I don\u2019t say nothin, let me see you swallow\nIn my crib got the co-ed back the new problem\nIn the club feed them liquor of the wise I'm starving\nSo much green gettin twisted like Botanical Garden, let's go\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nYou, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control\nQuit playing turn the music up a little bit\nBounce with me now shorty let's get into it\nYou, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control\nQuit playing turn the music up a little bit\nBounce with me now homey let's get into it\n\n[Verse 3: Prodigy]\nYou already know how it go, I bang, I shine\nI play, I stay I'm going for mine\nI'm young, I'm black, I'm rich and yes\nI'm ghetto than the motherfucking project steps\nI'm cool, I'm calm you looking real stressed\nI'm strapped I'm armed kid, hold your head\nI'm known for gat popping, when I got problems\nI don't run, I just gun you all up\nBut we ain't come here to start no drama\nWe just looking for our future baby mamas\nWith money with face with style and body\nI cook I clean I swear that mami\nJust as long as you don't go off and tell nobody\nI go down low, I'm lying I'm trying my best to let you know\nSugar pop get at P\nThe Doc beat make it easy to get 'em in the bed sheets\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nYou, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control\nQuit playing turn the music up a little bit\nBounce with me now shorty let's get into it\nYou, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control\nQuit playing turn the music up a little bit\nBounce with me now homey let's get into it"}}, {"title": "P.I.M.P (G-Unit Remix)", "album": "Get Rich or Die Tryin\u2019", "year": "2003-07-01", "lyrics": "[Chorus: 50 Cent]\nDon't know what you

"lyrics": "[Intro]\nShe loves me, she loves me not\nYeah, she loves me not\n\n[Verse 1]\nThe fiends need me, I ain't around, they bones ache\nDetox, rehab, cold sweats, watch them shake\nI'm not that genie in a bottle, I'm in a bag\nTake one hit and slide off to the Land of H man\nWhen we first met, I thought you'd never doubt me\nNow you tryin' to leave me, you never live without me\nGirl I'm missing you, come and see me soon\nTie your arm up, put that lighter under that spoon\nNow put that needle to ya arm princess, stick it in, relapse\nI'm back bitch, don't ever try that again\nAll the shit I did for you, I made you feel good\nWe have a love thing, you treatin' this like it's just a fling\nWhat we have is more sacred than a vow or a ring\nYou broke my heart you dirty bitch, I won't forget what you did\nIf you give birth, I'll already be in love with your kids\nListen I don't give a damn if your ass starts smokin'\nBut we have a bond that is not to be broken\n\n[Hook]\nWe got a love thing, girl you tried to leave me\nBut you need me, can you see you're addicted to me?\nWe got a love thing, I can take ya higher girl\nFuckin' with me, you can be all you can be\n\nWe got a love thing, girl you tried to leave me\nBut you need me, can you see you're addicted to me?\nWe got a love thing, I can take ya higher girl\nFuckin' with me, you can be all you can be\n\n[Verse 2]\nBaby you know, on the low, ya sister been eyein' me\nI'm good lookin', so you know soon she be tryin' me\nHeard she bi-sexual, she fuck what that girl\nBut boy, oh boy, fuckin' wit me is a whole 'nother world\nAfter that first night she fall in love, then chase the feelin\nI hung out with Marvin when he wrote Sexual Healing\nKurt Cobain, we were good friends, Ozzy Osbourne too\nI be with rock stars, see you lucky I'm fuckin' with you\nI chilled with Frankie Lymon and Jimi Hendrix crew\nSee this is new to you, but to me this ain't new\nI live the lavish life, listen if the mood is right\nMe you and ya sister can do the do tonight\nI never steer you wrong, if you hyper I make you calm\nI'll be your incentive, your reason for you to move forward\nLet's make a date, promise you'll come to see me\nEven if it means you have to sell ya mama's TV\nI love you, love me back, no one said lovin' me be easy\n\n[Hook]\nWe got a love thing, girl you tried to leave me\nBut you need me, can you see you're addicted to me?\nWe got a love thing, I can take ya higher girl\nFuckin' with me, you can be all you can be\n\nWe got a love thing, girl you tried to leave me\nBut you need me, can you see you're addicted to me?\nWe got a love thing, I can take ya higher girl\nFuckin' with me, you can be all you can be\n\n[Verse 3]\nI love you, I got you bare footed on glass, chasin a dove\nThat monkey on ya back symbolizes my love\nYour friends talk bad about me bitch, you sit there and listen to them\nOver and over you hurt me, my love is unconditional\nThey talk to you when you up when you down, then they got nothin' to say\nBut when you call up, I come runnin', I always take the pain away\nThey set you up to let you down, they crowned you prom queen\nThey know bout me behind your back, call you a fuckin' fiend\nCan we just be alone so I can kiss and hug you\nPush me inside you, no other man can love you like I do\nCall me daddy, I'll make you feel good, I mean real good\nI find pleasure in pleasing you like a real man should\nIt was written long before us, it was carved in a tree\nForever me and you baby, we were meant to be\nThere's more to life than laughter, what brought us together was fate\nAnd we'll be hand in hand when you walk through those pearly gates\nAnd to see to that, I'ma do whatever it takes\n\n[Hook]\nWe got a love thing, girl you tried to leave me\nBut you need me, can you see you're addicted to me?\nWe got a love thing, I can take ya higher girl\nFuckin' with me, you can be all you can be\n\nWe got a love thing, girl you tried to leave me\nBut you need me, can you see you're addicted to me?\nWe got a love thing, I can take ya higher girl\nFuckin' with me, you can be all you can be"}}, {"title": "UP!

me she want it, she know I know that she with it\nShe moan and groan when I get it, she tell me lick it, I did it\nShe's a sexy thing\nEnough to make a nigga go crazy man, do crazy things\nWe get to talkin' and touchin', we get to lickin' and stickin'\nNow, now you know what we doing, when you're around and we missin'\nWe go through perfect positions, we get it poppin', now listen\nToo much pleasure to measure, she got the power to beat it\nMake her wanna give it to me in that major way\nJack pot, jump shot, how a nigga fade away\nI mean way away, I be on that elite shit\nThat HBK, heartbreak kid freak shit\n\n[Chorus]\nI beat the pussy up, up, up, up, up, up, up\nI beat the pussy up, up, up, up, up, up, up\nI beat the pussy up, up, up, up, up, up, up\nI beat the pussy up, up, up, up, up, up, up\n\n[Young Jeezy]\nI'ma 'bout to call your bitch, cause she's scandalous\nI'm a pro with the wood, these niggas amateurs\nMake her bust a few times when I come through\nYou can smoke a blunt and kick it like Kung Fu\nGoin' crazy on this pussy, on your nut too\nYou done got 3 or 4, I'm tryna nut too\nShe talk that shit she got a awful mouth\nNigga hit her one time at the waffle house\nRight up in the IHOP\nBut it definitely wasn't my spot\nLook at all these bitches, where the bad ones at?\nYou know I hate a mad ho, where the glad ones at?\nI'm tryna dick some women when the club close\nLook at Jizzle, got the phantom full of club hoes\nYeah, Jizzle in his baseball cap\n'Bout to beat the pussy up, nigga baseball bat\n\n[Chorus]\nI beat the pussy up, up, up, up, up, up, up\nI beat the pussy up, up, up, up, up, up, up\nI beat the pussy up, up, up, up, up, up, up\nI beat the pussy up, up, up, up, up, up, up\n\n[T.I.]\nBeat that pussy up, jab, jab, right hook\nSend her home to her man, let 'em watch The Notebook\nShorty wanna hang, I'm a coat hook\nSplit that thing down the middle of the roll up\nShown up, Gucci down to the shoe lace\nHundred carats in the chain, no fugaise\nHoes still sweat a nigga on a cool day\nThem other sucker niggas fake as April Fool's Day\nAnd a rich nigga gotta pay, that(s) what you say\nI got bitches from the bay to the UK\nThick with it, pussy sweet like Kool-Aid\nRun abroad, then I let her bust two straight\nNo suitcase on the PJ runway\nMe plus two, thats a G4 three way\nI give her man a hard time\nHe gotta soft six and I gotta hard nine\n\n[Chorus]\nI beat the pussy up, up, up, up, up, up, up\nI beat the pussy up, up, up, up, up, up, up\nI beat the pussy up, up, up, up, up, up, up\nI beat the pussy up, up, up, up, up, up,

here\nI can hear your heartbeat\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nWe ain't cut from the same cloth, we into different shit\nI want the bread, you want the bitch\nCome out your mouth slick I'll get you hit\nMy niggas hungry, they hit a lick\nFuck who you're with, niggas'll dump a clip\nWe by the school yard waiting for you to get your kid\nI caught a A1 felony on my last bid\nKept calm, made bond, I'm on that shit\nYou think my rap shit a gimmick, I ain't seen parole in a minute\nTruth be told these niggas is hoes\nOnce the shit set off, man, anything goes\nThrough the windows of your soul, the eyes never lie\nIf you ain't scared to die, nigga, why would you cry?\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent]\nNigga, you pussy, you scared\nI can hear your heartbeat\nWhy the fuck would you come around here?\nI can hear

your mouth yet\nSocial media is giving cowards an outlet\nSee him in person, say something, I doubt that\nRather get caught with it than get caught without that\nTrying to back peddle and stumble on the curve\nYou stayin' at the ground, you mumblin' your words\nLiterally I can see your heart pumpin' through your shirt\nPussy your whole life, you always been a bird\nScared for so long it's all up in your nerves\nScrew 9-1-1, you probably call up the reserves\nAnd I'm killin' you first, if we ever do a purge\nAnd you know what it is, kid, whenever we emerge\nAnd I'm tragical, traumatical, no match, incompatible\nNigga, you vaginal\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent]\nNigga, you pussy, you scared\nI can hear your heartbeat\nWhy the fuck would you come around here?\nI can hear your heartbeat\nYeah, you

Hell\nFEDs on my coat tail, snitches given court tales\nKept fate when all hope fail\nNiggas rattin', all they missin' is the tail like Mickey Mouse\nCall me Mickey Mantle when I bat you in the mouth\nI bring them hammers out, we ain't trying to build a house\nNiggas on them songs rappin' shit they ain't about\nI'm from the N-O, we don't scrap, we bang it out\nBang, I'm the one that came in your house for the chickens\nLeft a nigga brains hangin' out like we chillin'\nStankin' like shipments, over my shillings\nUp your security, Rida gang in the building\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent]\nNigga, you

heartbeat\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nWe ain't cut from the same cloth, we into different shit\nI want the bread, you want the bitch\nCome out your mouth slick I'll get you hit\nMy niggas hungry, they hit a lick\nFuck who you're with, niggas'll dump a clip\nWe by the school yard waiting for you to get your kid\nI caught a A1 felony on my last bid\nKept calm, made bond, I'm on that shit\nYou think my rap shit a gimmick, I ain't seen parole in a minute\nTruth be told these niggas is hoes\nOnce the shit set off, man, anything goes\nThrough the windows of your soul, the eyes never lie\nIf you ain't scared to die, nigga, why would you cry?\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent]\nNigga, you pussy, you scared\nI can hear your heartbeat\nWhy the fuck would you come around here?\nI can hear your heartbeat\nYeah, you know a dog sense fear\nI can hear your heartbeat\nYou bark while we bite around here\nI can hear your heartbeat\n\n[Verse 2: Jadakiss]\n30 something and you ain't never open your mouth yet\nSocial media is giving cowards an outlet\nSee him in person, say something, I doubt that\nRather get caught with it than get caught without that\nTrying to back peddle and stumble on the curve\nYou stayin' at the ground, you mumblin' your words\nLiterally I can see your heart pumpin' through your shirt\nPussy your whole life, you always been a bird\nScared for so long it's all up in your nerves\nScrew 9-1-1, you probably call up the reserves\nAnd I'm killin' you first, if we ever do a purge\nAnd you know what it is, kid, whenever we emerge\nAnd I'm tragical, traumatical, no match, incompatible\nNigga, you vaginal\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent]\nNigga, you pussy, you scared\nI can hear your heartbeat\nWhy the fuck would you come around here?\nI can hear your heartbeat\nYeah, you know a dog sense fear\nI can hear your heartbeat\nYou bark while we bite around here\nI can hear your heartbeat\n\n[Verse 3: Kidd Kidd]\nMoney for bail, money to bail\nDead or in jail, Heaven or Hell\nFEDs on my coat tail, snitches given court tales\nKept fate when all hope fail\nNiggas rattin', all they missin' is the tail like Mickey Mouse\nCall me Mickey Mantle when I bat you in the mouth\nI bring them hammers out, we ain't trying to build a house\nNiggas on them songs rappin' shit they ain't about\nI'm from the N-O, we don't scrap, we bang it out\nBang, I'm the one that came in your house for the chickens\nLeft a nigga brains hangin' out like we chillin'\nStankin' like shipments, over my shillings\nUp your security, Rida gang in the building\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent]\nNigga, you pussy, you scared\nI can hear your heartbeat\nWhy the fuck would you come around here?\nI can hear your heartbeat\nYeah, you know a dog sense fear\nI can hear your heartbeat\nYou bark while we bite around

workin' her hips, you know the temperature rise\nOh Lord, soon as she see the dick in her thighs\nShe like the stones in my cross, she flawless\nI'm thinkin' damn, why would God give one woman all this?\nYou know I got the kind of conversation that make her feel like she need me\nIt's complicated, my occupation, pimpin' ain't easy\nFacts, I stack racks on racks and racks\nBack when I was pumpin' crack, now my cards are black\nNigga get on my level, bark with the big dogs\nIf I want it I buy it, I don't care what this shit costs\nLuther said it: a house is not a home without her\nI had 'em panties on the Greyhound filled up with powder\nBut what she showed what she'll do for me has no limits\nHer wantin' is temporary 'cause for sure she gon' get it, wassup\n\n[Hook: Trey Songz & 50 Cent]\nYou like smoke and you got me high\nYou make a nigga want to get down\nHigh\nHigh feelin' like I'm up in a cloud\nGirl, what the fuck you done to me?\nYou got me feelin' like you just rolled up

know its Dr. Dre, girl (Dre, girl)\n(Its 50) And Trigga, yeah\n\n[Break: Trey Songz]\nSomebody pull the fire alarm, girl, where you from?\n'Cause you got this club on fire and outside I bet all they smell is smoke\nAll they smell is smoke, girl, they yellin' smoke\nAll they smell is smoke\nThe way your body roll, I'ma lose control\n'Cause you got this club on fire and outside I bet all they smell is smoke\nAll they smell is smoke, girl, they yellin' smoke\nAll they smell is smoke\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nCome on\nPink diamonds, pink sand, beaches Aruba\nBlue sapphires on days when she feelin' Hoover\nShe hood and in the mood when I'm in the mood\nErotic, so exotic, I'm psychotic about it\nI don't want forever, I just wanna taste her love sample\nThat product, I bet a nigga tongue go numb\nShe's a narcotic, that bomb shit burnin', we smokin'\nMy old flame, my Mary Jane, we got a love thing\nShe ain't jealous, I keep Nina around\nIn the small of my back in case some shit go down\nRight under my Hermes, I'm hearin' the word is\nMe, I'm a P.I.M.P\nI let Trey hit some, then Dre hit some\nThen pass it to the homies 'til we all get done\nNiggas can't comprehend what this shit 'bout\nPolice comin', you like, put this shit out\n\n[Hook: Trey Songz & 50 Cent]\nYou like smoke and you got me high\nYou make a nigga want to get down\nHigh\nHigh feelin' like I'm up in a

thinkin' damn, why would God give one woman all this?\nYou know I got the kind of conversation that make her feel like she need me\nIt's complicated, my occupation, pimpin' ain't easy\nFacts, I stack racks on racks and racks\nBack when I was pumpin' crack, now my cards are black\nNigga get on my level, bark with the big dogs\nIf I want it I buy it, I don't care what this shit costs\nLuther said

Charli Brown Beatz]\n\n[Verse 1]\nI woke up this morning, this is insane\nRich as a motherfucker, and ain't much changed\nOpen my eyes, no surprise, I'm with a different bitch\nDifferent day, different ass, different tits\nStrap under my pillow, I done went legit\nI'm not supposed to do this shit, but I forget\nThe true principles of life are supply and demand\nGuess if you never sold dope it's hard to understand\nMy man got knowledge of self and my back, God\nFind out today's mathematics when that Mac go off\nMy temper volatile, grew up a violent child\nFuck a boy scout, I air your ass out\nNigga, nice chain, dice game, try your luck\nShoot a couple head cracks, leave while you're up\nI'm a fly nigga, my denim vintage\nGold medal around my neck like I won the Olympics\n\n[Chorus]\nWe came from nothing, now they saying we straight\nNigga, hold up, hold on\nHold on\nThese niggas, they watching every dime we make\nHold up, hold on\nHold on\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe want that deluxe apartment in the sky with a clear view\nInstead we get the D's in the rear view\nWe learn to play the game how it's supposed to be played\nAnd so you know, you violate, you supposed to be sprayed\nIt's not a big deal to me, stay calm\nI'll shoot the shit out of a nigga, then call it Barrel Bonds\nBut, if I don't do this shit myself, bet I'll get it done\nShit on my nigga, you shit on me, we of one\nUsed to do graffiti, now look we major\nDon't make me write my name across your face with a razor\nRe-Up, new coke, they say this sample the bomb\nThis shit can take a two and we cut this bitch with a one\nWatch the fiends stand in line for the potency\nNo lactose involved, pure coca leaf\nYou can sniff that or cook that to my belief\nThat money coming in like we run the

different bitch\nDifferent day, different ass, different tits\nStrap under my pillow, I done went legit\nI'm not supposed to do this shit, but I forget\nThe true principles of life are supply and demand\nGuess if you never sold dope it's hard to understand\nMy man got knowledge of self and my back, God\nFind out today's mathematics when that Mac go off\nMy temper volatile, grew up a violent child\nFuck a boy scout, I air your ass out\nNigga, nice chain, dice game, try your luck\nShoot a couple head cracks, leave while you're up\nI'm a fly nigga, my denim vintage\nGold medal around my neck like I won the Olympics\n\n[Chorus]\nWe came from nothing, now they saying we straight\nNigga, hold up, hold on\nHold on\nThese niggas, they watching every dime we make\nHold up, hold on\nHold on\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe want that deluxe apartment in the sky with a clear view\nInstead we get the D's in the rear view\nWe learn to play the game how it's supposed to be played\nAnd so you know, you violate, you supposed to be sprayed\nIt's not a big deal to me, stay calm\nI'll shoot the shit out of a nigga, then call it Barrel Bonds\nBut, if I don't do this shit myself, bet I'll get it done\nShit on my nigga, you shit on me, we of one\nUsed to do graffiti, now look we major\nDon't make me write my name across your face with a razor\nRe-Up, new coke, they say this sample the bomb\nThis shit can take a two and we cut this bitch with a one\nWatch the fiends stand in line for the potency\nNo lactose involved, pure coca leaf\nYou can sniff that or cook that to my belief\nThat money coming in like we run the streets\n\n[Chorus]\nWe came from nothing, now they saying we straight\nNigga, hold up, hold on\nHold on\nThese niggas, they watching every dime we make\nHold up, hold on\nHold on\n\n[Verse 3]\nThis shit go how I said, go when it's time to expand\nSo say it's over your dead body and that's the plan\nYou a gangster for real, you ready to ride?\nNigga, you gonna die a bad case of too much pride\nCheck my DNA, homie I'm a different kind\nHit the speed dial, that quick I'll get ya lined\nWe don't want your block, just cop your work from us\nThose niggas you call allies can't be trust\nThat Rollie all gold, I got the Midas touch\nSometimes it's hard as hell not to touch stuff\nOn the phone I heard 'Ya smacked the shit outta a kid\nNow Jimmy got life, gonna smack him again\nWhen it's war, it'll be war to the bitter end\nIf they ever say we lose, I start it again\nThat sneaky nigga spray that Semi at your momma crib\nWith a silencer we couldn't even hear that shit\n\n[Chorus]\nWe came from nothing, now they saying we straight\nNigga, hold up, hold on\nHold on\nThese niggas, they watching every dime we make\nHold up, hold on\nHold on"}}, {"title":

hood\nAin't nothing changed, still holla at my homies\nOh, and when I hit the block I still will kill\nAnd I don't want to, nigga, but I will if I got to\nKill, if niggas get to fucking around\nIf niggas get to fucking around\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nYeah, respect come from admiration and fear\nYou can admire me or you could catch one in your wig\nYou see the Testarossa, the toaster's right on my lap\nSo if a nigga get out of line then nigga get clapped\nI got an arsenal, an infantry I'm built for this mentally\nThat's why I'm the general, I do what they pretend to do\nFront on me now, nigga, I'll be the end of you\nForget your enemies and think of what your friends'll do\nI drop a bag off, then let a mag off\nThe Heckler and Koch'll tear half of your ass off\nI'm not for the games, I'm not for all the playing\nThe hollow tips rain when I unleash the pain\nGet the message from the lines or get the message from the nine\nPaint a picture with words, you can see when I shine\nPut my back on the wall, nigga, watch me go for mine\nI let 21 shots off at the same time, yeah\n\n[Hook: Akon]\nOh, don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood\nAin't nothing changed, still holla at my homies\nOh, and when I hit the block I still will kill\nAnd I don't want to, nigga, but I will if I got to\nKill, if niggas get to fucking around\nIf niggas get to fucking around\n\n[Verse 2: 50 Cent]\nYeah, where I'm from death is always in the air, homie\nNana love me so you know she say my prayers for me\nI come creeping through the hood wearing Teflon\nHit the corners, motherfuckers get left on\nNiggas know, if not they better check my background\nTry and stick me I'll fill your back with mac rounds\nAsk Prim', nigga, 50 don't back down\nI kick it funky like fiends in the crack house\nCross the line, boy, I'mma air ya ass out\nScrew your face at me I wanna know what that's 'bout\nNigga I know you ain't mad I done came up\nAnd if you are, fuck you cause I ain't change up\nThe O.G.'s wanna talk, but I don't know these niggas\nAnd I ain't did no business with 'em, I don't owe these niggas\nA minute of my time, I get it cause I grind\nAll across the globe like the world's mine, yeh\n\n[Hook: Akon]\nOh, don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood\nAin't nothing changed, still holla at my homies\nOh, and when I hit the block I still will kill\nAnd I don't want to, nigga, but I will if I got to\nKill, if niggas get to fucking around\nIf niggas get to fucking around\n\n[Verse 3: Akon]\nNow tell me have you ever looked off in the distance\nAnd seen the mac aiming at your head, mane?\nBefore you know it life is flashing, reminiscing\nAnd your body is dripping and full of lead, mane\nI done been there, I done copped that\nIt ain't never been a question, I'm bout that\nDon't go there, you get clapped at\nAnd if you plan to fuck around and re-route that\nYou'll never catch me riding around on these streets\nWithout a couple metal pieces under my feet\nFully automatic weapons unloaded will unleash\nStash up under the carpet like a can of sea breeze\n50 don't make me ride on these niggas\nCause I will kill, dip and hide on these niggas\n50 don't make me ride on these niggas\nCause I be long gone like The Ripper so\n\n[Hook: Akon]\nOh, don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood\nAin't nothing changed, still holla at my homies\nOh, and when I hit the block I still will kill\nAnd I don't want to, nigga, but I will if I got to\nKill, if niggas get to fucking around\nIf niggas get to fucking around"}}, {"title": "Psycho", "album": "Before I Self Destruct", "year": "2009-11-09", "lyrics": "[Produced by Dr. Dre]\n\n[Intro: 50 Cent]\nI can hear your heartbeat, you're scared\nYeah, yeah, I can hear your heartbeat, you're scared\nI can hear your heartbeat, you're scared\nYeah, yeah, I can hear your heartbeat, you're scared\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nYou see I'm a psycho (a psycho), a sicko (a sicko)\nI'm crazy (I'm crazy, I'm crazy)\nI said I got my knife pulled (knife pulled)\nI'll kill you (I'll kill you) if you make me (you make me)\nThey wanna see me shot up (shot up)\nLocked up (locked up), then cage me (cage me)\nI'll come back bigger (bigger)\nStronger (stronger) and angry (and angry)\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nYeah, look look, I come from a different crew, you fuck with me I'll get to you\nA clip or two I'll cripple you just 'cause I ain't got shit to do\nPistol pop, a pussy drop, drama never ever stop\nEenie meenie mini moe, nine, trey pound or forty fo'\nPick a strap, The Tec, the Mac, the Hawk, I stab it in your back\nI'll blow your brains, I know your name and where you rest, I make a mess\nThe hollow tips will hit your chest, you cough up blood 'til EMS\nCome pick you up, you know you're fucked when you get on the stretcher\n'Cause I come into ICU to see you off to Heaven\nThe system I done been through, it is nothing new to it to me\nThey lock me up, they let me out, you seen this in the movies\nThe criminals be criminals while they up in corrections\nThey come home get, a nine, then commit crime in perfection\nIt's murder one, they found a gun, now they doing ballistics\nBut they can't find a fingerprint, the shit's going terrific\nGet so close on your target that it's really hard to miss it\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nYou see I'm a psycho (a psycho), a sicko (a sicko)\nI'm crazy (I'm crazy, I'm crazy)\nI said I got my knife pulled (knife pulled)\nI'll kill you (I'll kill you) if you make me (you make me)\nThey wanna see me shot up (shot up)\nLocked up (locked up), then cage me (cage me)\nI'll come back bigger (bigger)\nStronger (stronger) and angry (and angry)\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nMan, these are average raps, I'm keeping the savage batch hid\nIn the can of whoop ass with the Shady/Aftermath lid\nYou pop off the top, it's like opening vats of acid\nBeat the Octomom to death with a Cabbage Patch Kid\nAttack a snatch, yeah, there's something to jack a batch in\nImpregnated then shoot up the embryo sac with MAC-10s\nTriplets, quadruplets, and a couple of back-to-back twins\nDead fetuses falling out all over, Jack is back again\nThe Ripper's at your service, girl I can see that you're nervous\nBut I barely scratched the surface like my last batch of girlfriends\nThat I buried in my fucking backyard\nStill trying to dig their way out\nI foam like an attack dog\nHow late you wanna stay out?\nIt's past your curfew when it's dark\nI'm searching for you in the park\nShady murdered him another virgin, he just hit his mark\nHe met his quota for the month, they found Dakota all rolled up\nInside a bag, he probably dragged the body for about a block\nDisappeared without a trace, no DNA, no not a drop\n'Cause me and Dre and 50 we will never get caught by the cops\nCSI, they hate us, but they gotta give a lot of props\nIf drama pops, grab the butcher knife from off the counter tops\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nYou see I'm a psycho (a psycho), a sicko (a sicko)\nI'm crazy (I'm crazy, I'm crazy)\nI said I got my knife pulled (knife pulled)\nI'll kill you (I'll kill you) if you make me (you make me)\nThey wanna see me shot up (shot up)\nLocked up (locked up), then cage me (cage me)\nI'll come back bigger (bigger)\nStronger (stronger) and angry (and angry)\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nYeah, I'm as ill as can be\nMy appeal is to serial killers what a pill is to me\nKilling so villainously\nStill as maniacal on the NyQuil and psycho as Michael Myers\nYou know what we're like on the motherfucking mic so try us\nAnd you're gonna find out what the fuck we're like with pliers\n\n[50 Cent]\nIt's operation time, they got him hooked up to wires\nSqueezing, be bleeding, wheezing, breathing, he half dead\nHe must ain't know, but now we know how Shady the Math is\nEven murderous tactics get better with practice\nLead showers, gun powder, feel the talons burn burn\nSchool of arts, Julliard, you better learn learn\n\n[Eminem]\nChris Reeves in his grave, yeah, homie, turn turn\nI'm debating mutilating the lady\nYou've been waiting for Shady and Fif, ain't no duplicating it, baby\nThere's a baby in the dryer, there's a torso in the washer\nI think it might even belong to Portia when I tossed her\nArms and legs in the garbage, 'cause the rest of her - I lost her\nHer head is in the disposal with Jessica's, I squashed her\nAnd put her through the wringer and hung her over the wash tub\n\n[50 Cent]\nWhen I'm through with Ricky it'll be blood that he'll cough up\nThe hard rock I'll soft up, get caught up and get washed up\nIn Detroit or Norfolk, witness this shit, end up nauseous\nLook deep in my eye, see many many men die\nI swing gem stars faster than a Samurai\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nYou see I'm a psycho (a psycho), a sicko (a sicko)\nI'm crazy (I'm crazy, I'm crazy)\nI said I got my knife pulled (knife pulled)\nI'll kill you (I'll kill you) if you make me (you make me)\nThey wanna see me shot up (shot up)\nLocked up (locked up), then cage me (cage me)\nI'll come back bigger (bigger)\nStronger (stronger) and angry (and angry)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/eebe68987c98d3b1f9b4166f6ac4d3f7.1000x1000x1.jpg",

hear your heartbeat, you're scared\nYeah, yeah, I can hear your heartbeat, you're scared\nI can hear your heartbeat, you're scared\nYeah, yeah, I can hear your heartbeat, you're scared\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nYou see I'm a psycho (a psycho), a sicko (a sicko)\nI'm crazy (I'm crazy, I'm crazy)\nI said I got my knife pulled (knife pulled)\nI'll kill you (I'll kill you) if you make me (you make me)\nThey wanna see me shot up (shot up)\nLocked up (locked up), then cage me (cage me)\nI'll come back bigger (bigger)\nStronger (stronger) and angry (and angry)\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nYeah, look look, I come from a different crew, you fuck with me I'll get to you\nA clip or two I'll cripple you just 'cause I ain't got shit to do\nPistol pop, a pussy drop, drama never ever stop\nEenie meenie mini moe, nine, trey pound or forty fo'\nPick a strap, The Tec, the Mac, the Hawk, I stab it in your back\nI'll blow your brains, I know your name and where you rest, I make a mess\nThe hollow tips will hit your chest, you cough up blood 'til EMS\nCome pick you up, you know you're fucked when you get on the stretcher\n'Cause I come into ICU to see you off to Heaven\nThe system I done been through, it is nothing new to it to me\nThey lock me up, they let me out, you seen this in the movies\nThe criminals be criminals while they up in corrections\nThey come home get, a nine, then commit crime in perfection\nIt's murder one, they found a gun, now they doing ballistics\nBut they can't find a fingerprint, the shit's going terrific\nGet so close on your target that it's really hard to miss it\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nYou see I'm a psycho (a psycho), a sicko (a sicko)\nI'm crazy (I'm crazy, I'm crazy)\nI said I got my knife pulled (knife pulled)\nI'll kill you (I'll kill you) if you make me (you make me)\nThey wanna see me shot up (shot up)\nLocked up (locked up), then cage me (cage me)\nI'll come back bigger (bigger)\nStronger (stronger) and angry (and angry)\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nMan, these are average raps, I'm keeping the savage batch hid\nIn the can of whoop ass with the Shady/Aftermath lid\nYou pop off the top, it's like opening vats of acid\nBeat the Octomom to death with a Cabbage Patch Kid\nAttack a snatch, yeah, there's something to jack a batch in\nImpregnated then shoot up the embryo sac with MAC-10s\nTriplets, quadruplets, and a couple of back-to-back twins\nDead fetuses falling out all over, Jack is back again\nThe Ripper's at your service, girl I can see that you're nervous\nBut I barely scratched the surface like my last batch of girlfriends\nThat I buried in my fucking backyard\nStill trying to dig their way out\nI foam like an attack dog\nHow late you wanna stay out?\nIt's past your curfew when it's dark\nI'm searching for you in the park\nShady murdered him another virgin, he just hit his mark\nHe met his quota for the month, they found Dakota all rolled up\nInside a bag, he probably dragged the body for about a block\nDisappeared without a trace, no DNA, no not a drop\n'Cause me and Dre and 50 we will never get caught by the cops\nCSI, they hate us, but they gotta give a lot of props\nIf drama pops, grab the butcher knife from off the counter tops\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nYou see I'm a psycho (a psycho), a sicko (a sicko)\nI'm crazy (I'm crazy, I'm crazy)\nI said I got my knife pulled (knife pulled)\nI'll kill you (I'll kill you) if you make me (you make me)\nThey wanna see me shot up (shot up)\nLocked up (locked up), then cage me (cage me)\nI'll come back bigger (bigger)\nStronger (stronger) and angry (and angry)\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nYeah, I'm as ill as can be\nMy appeal is to serial killers what a pill is to me\nKilling so villainously\nStill as maniacal on the NyQuil and psycho as Michael Myers\nYou know what we're like on the motherfucking mic so try us\nAnd you're gonna find out what the fuck we're like with pliers\n\n[50 Cent]\nIt's operation time, they got him hooked up to wires\nSqueezing, be bleeding, wheezing, breathing, he half dead\nHe must ain't know, but now we know how Shady the Math is\nEven murderous tactics get better with practice\nLead showers, gun powder, feel the talons burn burn\nSchool of arts, Julliard, you better learn learn\n\n[Eminem]\nChris Reeves in his grave, yeah, homie, turn turn\nI'm debating mutilating the lady\nYou've been waiting for Shady and Fif, ain't no duplicating it, baby\nThere's a baby in the dryer, there's a torso in the washer\nI think it might even belong to Portia when I tossed her\nArms and legs in the garbage, 'cause the rest of her - I lost her\nHer head is in the disposal with Jessica's, I squashed her\nAnd put her through the wringer and hung her over the wash tub\n\n[50 Cent]\nWhen I'm through with Ricky it'll be blood that he'll cough up\nThe hard rock I'll soft up, get caught up and get washed up\nIn Detroit or Norfolk, witness this shit, end up nauseous\nLook deep in my eye, see many many men die\nI swing gem stars faster than a Samurai\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nYou see I'm a psycho (a psycho), a sicko (a sicko)\nI'm crazy (I'm crazy, I'm crazy)\nI said I got my knife pulled (knife pulled)\nI'll kill you (I'll kill you) if you make me (you make me)\nThey wanna see me shot up (shot up)\nLocked up (locked up), then cage me (cage me)\nI'll come back bigger (bigger)\nStronger (stronger) and angry (and angry)"}}, {"title": "So Disrespectful", "album": "Before I Self Destruct", "year": "2009-11-09", "lyrics": "[Produced by Tha Bizness]\n\n[Intro]\nI'm so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful\nI'm so

carriage\nThen came the cash then the baby mama drama\nI gave that bitch a half a mill, she blew it on Prada\nI remember when I met the bitch and she ain't have nada\nGot my son on some fly shit, now I gotta buy shit\nMan, I can't even flaunt shit cause everybody want shit\nEverybody mad, damn even my dad\nAnd I don't even know him, now how the fuck I owe him?\nI ain't giving nobody shit, I'mma show them\nI gave Game hits, he told me to suck dick\nStarted screaming Westside and Dre ain't say shit\nNow we just eat off him, and when I talk to Em\nA smile comes on his face, he told me here's

"lyrics": "[Produced by Tha Bizness]\n\n[Intro]\nI'm so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful\nI'm so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful\n\n[Verse 1]\nYour daddy fucked your mama then fucked your sister\nThen climbed in your bed playing with your shitter\nGo 'head, take your belt off and hang yourself\nMatter of fact grab your strap and bang yourself\nJay's a big man, he's too big to respond\nI'm a big dick, you know the one everybody's on\nYou 'gon make me sing ''Murder Was The Case''\nBullets ricochet *ping ping*, shoot the star off your face\nI'm international, I'm never home, mane\nI've been gone so long my accent changed\nYou better watch who you fuck with, mate\nOr you 'gon make me carve your ass up now straight\nCome on, Game, you will never be my equal\nYour homies shoot doors, my niggas shoot people\nSee me I'm what you never 'gon be\nI'm in that tax bracket you never 'gon see\n\n[Hook]\nWhen you cross me, I'm so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful\nSee, I get so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful\nWhen you cross me, I'm so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful\nSee, I get so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful\n\n[Verse 2]\nThat nigga Buck like Gator, tell momma he done smoked the TV\nI ain't know he fucked with more dope than B.G\nPlus a nigga sipped more syrup than Pimp C\nMan keeping these motherfuckers rich ain't easy\nEspecially when a nigga wanna stunt like Jeezy\nAnd his CDs' didn't sell like his CDs'\nMan, that nigga blew all of his chips on them breezies\nMad cause the world won't treat him like Weezy\nLook I don't give a fuck, nigga, please believe me\nNo nigga in no vocal booth around can see me\nIt's crazy how I make this shit look oh so easy\nThey say, \"50, nah, I don't fuck with him, he oh so greasy\nYeah, he used to share that paper now he oh so greedy\"\nIt's funny how they shit on me cause them they need me\nSee me I'm number one, I'm loading up my gun\nI catch ya and you done, you pussy nigga run\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nThey say first comes love then comes marriage\nInstead I got Shaniqua in a baby carriage\nThen came the cash then the baby mama drama\nI gave that bitch a half a mill, she blew it on Prada\nI remember when I met the bitch and she ain't have nada\nGot my son on some fly shit, now I gotta buy shit\nMan, I can't even flaunt shit cause everybody want shit\nEverybody mad, damn even my dad\nAnd I don't even know him, now how the fuck I owe him?\nI ain't giving nobody shit, I'mma show them\nI gave Game hits, he told me to suck dick\nStarted screaming Westside and Dre ain't say shit\nNow we just eat off him, and when I talk to Em\nA smile comes on his face, he told me here's the case\n''Enemies stay enemies but friends they change\nNiggas go crazy over money, my mane''\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "Gatman and Robbin", "album": "The Massacre", "year": "2005-03-03", "lyrics": "[Eminem]\nGee willikers Gatman, they got me surrounded\n\n[50 Cent]\nI'm on my way\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent (Eminem)]\nI got a (Gat, man), if there's a problem I'ma solve it\nA nigga movin' around with a big-ass revolver\nAnd a (bat, man)\nWhat the fuck are you retarded?\nYou touch Shady, I'll leave you dearly departed\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nThis ain't Batman, Robin, Cagney or Lacey\nIt's 50 Cent and Shady, the worst, baby\nPut your hands on my peoples I'll react crazy\nPut a hole through your front and your back, maybe\nBut go 'head, you try me\nI'll have your ass hooked up to an IV\nI leave no witnesses when I ride, B\nYou fuck with me, you'll see\nI react like an animal and tear you apart\nIf a masterpiece was murder I'd major in art\nNiggas know I was wrapped too tight from the start\nBut being a little off landed me on top of the charts (woo!)\nSo you take the good with the bad, I guess\nLevel three Teflon plate on my chest\nHammer cocked back, hollow tip in the chamber, danger\nAnger'll change ya, and make you aim at -- and squeeze\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent

leave you dearly departed\nWe're walking away from a beef in which clearly you started\nI said we're walking away, did you hear me?\nYou oughta be thankful that we ain't beefin'\nWe\u2019re still breathing and just leave it at (THAT!)\n'Cause if me and 50 and G-Unit hop back in that BAT\u2014mobile\nIt ain't gonna be no more rap it's gonna be (BRRAT!)\nRetaliation, it'll be like them Muslim Shiia (ATTACKS!)\nSomewhere along the line it's like me and 50 made a (PACT!)\nHe's got my back, I got his back (BACK!)\nIt's almost like we're kinda like Siamese twins\n'Cause when we beef we pull each other into the bullshit\nLike we're conjoined at the hip, this is unavoidable\nSome of the shit is squashable; some shit'll never boil over\nSome of it will just simmer at best if left alone\nBut let it be known there will be no sitdowns\nWith no Daves and 'Zinos\nThere will be no peace discussions with me\nThere ain't gonna be no friendly debates over crumpets and tea\nJust quit fucking with me and I'll gladly quit fucking with you\nJust spit your sixteen and do what you gotta do to get through\nWithout mentioning me\nOr the machine of Jimmy Iovine or Dre or 50\nOr D-Twizzie, Obie and just let it be\nOr we'll be (knock knock) with a\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent (Eminem)]\n(Gat, man), if there's a problem I'ma solve it\nA nigga movin' around with a big-ass revolver\nAnd a (bat, man)\nWhat the fuck are you retarded?\nYou touch Shady, I'll leave you dearly departed\n\n[Verse 3: 50 Cent]\nNigga you get it twisted, you gon' get your wig splitted\nI don't give a fuck, I don't care if police know I did it\nMan I hustle, I get money in the sunshine or a blizzard\nI go hard for that paper, homie, I just gotta get it\nGot a money scheme, you plot it, you can count me in I'm with it\nYou cross me, you gon' make a cemetery visit\nThat's gangsta, you know me I talk 'cause I live it\nShell cases drop, when that chopper chop, way up the block\nGet hit with copper tops, when the drama pop, the llama pop\nAnd it won't stop, you can run call the cops\nThis ain't new, niggas know how I be on it\nThat shit you got, put my pistol to you, I want it\nIt's not a game, perfect aim\nYou feel the flame up against your brain\nMan it's so hot, I'll make you wish it rained\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent (Eminem)]\nI got a (Gat, man), if there's a problem I'ma solve it\nA nigga movin' around with a big-ass revolver\nAnd a (bat, man)\nWhat the fuck are you retarded?\nYou touch Shady, I'll leave you dearly departed\n(Woo, woo!!)", "image":

way\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent (Eminem)]\nI got a (Gat, man), if there's a problem I'ma solve it\nA nigga movin' around with a big-ass revolver\nAnd a (bat, man)\nWhat the fuck are you retarded?\nYou touch Shady, I'll leave you dearly departed\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nThis ain't Batman, Robin, Cagney or Lacey\nIt's 50 Cent and Shady, the worst, baby\nPut your hands on my peoples I'll react crazy\nPut a hole through your front and your back, maybe\nBut go 'head, you try me\nI'll have your ass hooked up to an IV\nI leave no witnesses when I ride, B\nYou fuck with me, you'll see\nI react like an animal and tear you apart\nIf a masterpiece was murder I'd major in art\nNiggas know I was wrapped too tight from the start\nBut being a little off landed me on top of the charts (woo!)\nSo you take the good with the bad, I guess\nLevel three Teflon plate on my chest\nHammer cocked back, hollow tip in the chamber, danger\nAnger'll change ya, and make you aim at -- and squeeze\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent (Eminem)]\nI got a (Gat, man), if there's a problem I'ma solve it\nA nigga movin' around with a big-ass revolver\nAnd a (bat, man)\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nMotherfucker, you retarded?\nYou touch 50, I'll leave you dearly departed\nWe're walking away from a beef in which clearly you started\nI said we're walking away, did you hear me?\nYou oughta be thankful that we ain't beefin'\nWe\u2019re still breathing and just leave it at (THAT!)\n'Cause if me and 50 and G-Unit hop back in that BAT\u2014mobile\nIt ain't gonna be no more rap it's gonna be (BRRAT!)\nRetaliation, it'll be like them Muslim Shiia (ATTACKS!)\nSomewhere along the line it's like me and 50 made a (PACT!)\nHe's got my back, I got his back (BACK!)\nIt's almost like we're kinda like Siamese twins\n'Cause when we beef we pull each other into the bullshit\nLike we're conjoined at the hip, this is unavoidable\nSome of the shit is squashable; some shit'll never boil over\nSome of it will just simmer at best if left alone\nBut let it be known there will be no sitdowns\nWith no Daves and 'Zinos\nThere will be no peace discussions with me\nThere ain't gonna be no friendly debates over crumpets and tea\nJust quit fucking with me and I'll gladly quit fucking with you\nJust spit your sixteen and do what you gotta do to get through\nWithout mentioning me\nOr the machine of Jimmy Iovine or Dre or 50\nOr D-Twizzie, Obie and just let it be\nOr we'll be (knock knock) with a\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent (Eminem)]\n(Gat, man), if there's a problem I'ma solve it\nA nigga movin' around with a big-ass revolver\nAnd a (bat, man)\nWhat the fuck are you retarded?\nYou touch Shady, I'll leave you dearly departed\n\n[Verse 3: 50 Cent]\nNigga you get it twisted, you gon' get your wig splitted\nI don't give a fuck, I don't care if police know I did it\nMan I hustle, I get money in the sunshine or a blizzard\nI go hard for that paper, homie, I just gotta get it\nGot a money scheme, you plot it, you can count me in I'm with it\nYou cross me, you gon' make a cemetery visit\nThat's gangsta, you know me I talk 'cause I live it\nShell cases drop, when that chopper chop, way up the block\nGet hit with copper tops, when the drama pop, the llama pop\nAnd it won't stop, you can run call the cops\nThis ain't new, niggas know how I be on it\nThat shit you got, put my pistol to you, I want it\nIt's not a game, perfect aim\nYou feel the flame up against your brain\nMan it's so hot, I'll make you wish it rained\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent (Eminem)]\nI got a (Gat, man), if there's a problem I'ma solve it\nA nigga movin' around with a big-ass

bitch, get in\"\nMy earring saying \"We can hit the mall together\"\nShorty, it's only right that we ball together\nI'm into bigger things, y'all niggas, y'all know my style\nYour wrist \"bling bling\", my shit \"bling blaow\"\nMy pinky ring talk, it say \"Fifty, I'm sick\"\nThat's why these niggas is on my dick\nSome hate me, some love my hits\nFlex my man he gon' bump my shit\nSee I'm a liar, man, I really don't care\nI tell them hoes whatever they wanna hear\nYou tryna play me, Imma blaze ya then\nMy cross cost more than the crib ya mamma raised ya in\n\n[Hook]\nI was a poor nigga, now I'm a rich nigga\nGetting paper now you can't tell me shit, nigga\nYou can find me in the fo' dot six, nigga\nIn the backseat fondling ya bitch, nigga\n\n[Verse 2]\nNew York niggas copy niggas like it's all good\nFuck around ,we crip-walking in the wrong hood\nI'm fresh up out the slammer, I ain't no fucking bama\nI'm from NY whoady, but I know country grammar\nSee me I get it crunk, niggas go head and front\nI go up out the trunk, come back, roll out, I'm done\nMy money come in lumps, my pockets got the mumps\nYou see me sitting on dubs, that's why you mad chump\nDon't make me hit ya up, these shells will split ya up\nI lay you down, the coroners will come and get ya up\nSee 50 play for keeps and 50 stay with heat\nI can't go commercial, they love me in the street\nI'm real gutta, man; the hood love me, man\nDon't make me show up in ya crib like bruh man\nLocked up in a pen, I still do my thing\nCO screaming \"Shut the fuck up!\" in the bing\n\n[Hook]\nI was a poor nigga, now I'm a rich nigga\nGetting paper now you can't tell me shit, nigga\nYou can find me in the fo' dot six, nigga\nIn the backseat fondling ya bitch, nigga\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm in the Benz on Monday, the BM on Tuesday\nRange on Wednesday, Thursday I'm in the hooptay\nPorsche on Friday, I do things my way\nVipe or Vette, I tear up the highway\nShorty'll tell ya I'm 'bout my dick-game\nBut she don't know me, she only know my nickname\nLeft the hood and came back, damn shit changed\nThese young boys, they done got they own work, man\n\n[Hook]\nI was a poor nigga, now I'm a rich nigga\nGetting paper now

(Yeah! It's my tape man) Whoa\nWhoa oooh oooh oooh!!! (Listen to my tape)\nI've waited, yeah!!! (WOO!!!)\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nIf I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time\n(I want you 'round me all the time)\nCan I be your best friend if you promise you'll be mine?\n(Girl promise you'll be mine)\nThey say he's just a friend (Uh huh)\nNow, girl let's not pretend (Come on)\nEither he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!)\nPlease say he's just a friend\nIf I was your best friend\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nFirst we get the talkin, then we get the touchin'\nIf we get past the phone games we'll be fuckin'\nI kiss like the french then put my tongue in your ear\nDo it like the dogs do it girl and pull on your hair\nFor me a different scenery just means a different position\nIn the tub or on the sink, I improvise now listen\nIn the chopper or on the jet, join the mile high club\nI'm no fool I know money can't buy me love (Ha Ha)\n\n[Verse 2: Olivia]\nYou said that I could call you whenever I needed someone to listen to me\nThat's why I'm here standin' by your side cause you always come through for me\nSo many others tried to be where you are but they just wanted to do me\nGlad you took your time and now I'm satisfied that's why I want you all to me\n\n[Hook: Olivia]\nCause if you were my best friend, I want you 'round all the time\n(I want you 'round me baby)\nCan I be your best friend, I promise boy you'll be mine\n(Oooh baby be mine)\nI said he's just a friend, baby it's not pretend\nEither he is or he ain't my man, I said he's just a friend\n\n[50 Cent]\nIf I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time\n(I want you 'round me all the time)\nCan I be your best friend, if you promise you'll be mine\n(Girl promise you'll be mine)\nPlease say he's just a friend (Uh huh)\nNow girl let's not pretend (Come on)\nEither he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!)\nPlease say he's just a friend\nIf I was your best friend\n\n[Verse 3: 50 Cent]\nWhile you in your bubble bath I'll come wash on your back\nWhen you puttin on your lotion I can help you with that\nI sit and think of things to say that may make you smile\nOr give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style\nOr slang I use when we build may change how you talk\nAnd if I'm focused while I'm strokin I could change how you walk\nThere's a swagger that you calm but when you come from New York\nI'm a hustler I just hustle in the things that I bought\nSeparate, come on\n\n[Verse 4: Olivia]\nI'm not afraid to explore my body - oooh, gimme that feelin\nNow we can watch some TV or play a CD; baby that sexual healin'\nYou tried to sing to me; you're never on the key, but you do it just to appease me\nI rather spend my time wastin' time with you; oooh wee you make it so easy\n\n[Hook: Olivia]\nCause if you were my best friend, I want you 'round all the time\n(I want you 'round all the time)\nCan I be your best friend, I promise boy you will be mine\n(Please baby be mine yeah!)\nI said he's just a friend (Oh Oooh!)\nBaby it's not pretend (No baby)\nEither he is or he ain't my man, I said he's just a friend\n\n[Bridge: Olivia]\nWe been better than friends, for a long time\nAin't no need to pretend, you'll always be mine\nWe been better than friends, for a long time\nAin't no need to pretend, you'll always be mine\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nIf I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time\n(I want you 'round me all the time)\nCan I be your best friend, if you promise you'll be mine\n(Girl promise you'll be mine)\nPlease say he's just a friend (Uh huh)\nNow girl let's not pretend (Come on)\nEither he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!)\nPlease say he's just a friend\nIf I was your best friend"}}, {"title": "Gotta Make it to Heaven", "album": "Get Rich or Die Tryin\u2019", "year": "2003-02-06", "lyrics": "[Produced by Megahertz]\n\n[Chorus]\nI gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell\nI gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven\nI gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell\nI gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven\n\n[Verse 1]\nSome say I'm paranoid, I say I'm careful how I choose my friends\nI been to ICU once, I ain't going again\nFirst Z got murked then Roy got murked\nAnd homie still in the hood, why he ain't getting hurt?\nI smell something fishy, man, it might be a rat\nDamn, niggas switching sides on niggas just like that\nYou know me, I stay with a bitch on her knees\nAnd give guns away in the hood like it's government cheese\nSpray off Suzuki's, eleven hundred cc's\nNo plate on the back, straight squeezing the MAC\nIn the hood they identify niggas by their cars\nSo I switch up whips to stay off the radar\nI ain't gotta be around to make shit hot\nI'll send Yayo to dump 30 shots on your block\nYou should spray that TEC, nigga, if I say get it done\nI'll make you wet niggas if you 'round me son\n\n[Chorus]\nI gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell\nI gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven\nI gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell\nI gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen I come through the hood, I don't stop to rap to niggas\nGet close enough to smack then I'll clap ya nigga\nPop tried to front so I waved the chrome on his ass\nPoint blank range I spazzed, pulled a bone on his ass\nTwo weeks later niggas came through with MACs to lay me down\nThey sprayed, I played dead and got the fuck off the ground\nOut the blue I get a phone call: \"Fifty what up?\"\n\"They sent a bitch at me, I sent the bitch back cut up\"\nI don't play that pussy shit, I done told you, boy\nFront on me you gon' meet one of my soldiers, boy\nCousin Twin shot up his mamma crib, now he in jail\nTripping off flicks of Blu Cantrell, pussy, and black tail\nPop mama moved, but she don't talk to him no mo'\nThe shells from Twin's fo'-fo' blew the hinge off her door\nWithout that check every month how she going to pay for the crib?\nMan, social service finna come and take them kids\n\n[Chorus]\nI gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell\nI gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven\nI gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell\nI gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven\n\n[Verse 3]\nLord, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change\nThe courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference\nIn AA they make you say that\nThat's the prayer they burn in your head when you a case act\nMan, I might talk to you while we up in them pens\nBut when we come home that don't mean we going to fucking be friends\nThe shells pass your head close enough to hear them whistle\nThank God they missed you and go grab your pistol\nIn the hood niggas running 'round acting crazy\nBuying little Air Jordans for maybe babies\nSee it might be his and it might be yours\nBecause them broads in the projects is straight up whores\nMan, it don't take much for you to get in them drawers\nYou can have them on their back or on all fours\nYou ain't got to tell me, you feeling this shit\nBecause I hear what I'm saying, I know I'm killing this shit\n\n[Chorus]\nI gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell\nI gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven\nI gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell\nI gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven", "image": "https://images.genius.com/17bdb55979efe915f90e0fa67b92ad61.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist":

Hell\nI gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven\n\n[Verse 1]\nSome say I'm paranoid, I say I'm careful how I choose my friends\nI been to ICU once, I ain't going again\nFirst Z got murked then Roy got murked\nAnd homie still in the hood, why he ain't getting hurt?\nI smell something fishy, man, it might be a rat\nDamn, niggas switching sides on niggas just like that\nYou know me, I stay with a bitch on her knees\nAnd give guns away in the hood like it's government cheese\nSpray off Suzuki's, eleven hundred cc's\nNo plate on the back, straight squeezing the MAC\nIn the hood they identify niggas by their cars\nSo I switch up whips to stay off the radar\nI ain't gotta be around to make shit hot\nI'll send Yayo to dump 30 shots on your block\nYou should spray that TEC, nigga, if I say get it done\nI'll make you wet niggas if you 'round me son\n\n[Chorus]\nI gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell\nI gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven\nI gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell\nI gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen I come through the hood, I don't stop to rap to niggas\nGet close enough to smack then I'll clap ya nigga\nPop tried to front so I waved the chrome on his ass\nPoint blank range I spazzed, pulled a bone on his ass\nTwo weeks later niggas came through with MACs to lay me down\nThey sprayed, I played dead and got the fuck off the ground\nOut the blue I get a phone call: \"Fifty what up?\"\n\"They sent a bitch at me, I sent the bitch back cut up\"\nI don't play that pussy shit, I done told you, boy\nFront on me you gon' meet one of my soldiers, boy\nCousin Twin shot up his mamma crib, now he in jail\nTripping off flicks of Blu Cantrell, pussy, and black tail\nPop mama moved, but she don't talk to him no mo'\nThe shells from Twin's fo'-fo' blew the hinge off her door\nWithout that check every month how she going to pay for the crib?\nMan, social service finna come and take them kids\n\n[Chorus]\nI gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell\nI gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven\nI gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell\nI gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven\n\n[Verse 3]\nLord, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change\nThe courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference\nIn AA they make you say that\nThat's the prayer they burn in your head when you a case act\nMan, I might talk to you while we up in them pens\nBut when we come home that don't mean we going to fucking be friends\nThe shells pass your head close enough to hear them whistle\nThank God they missed you and go grab your pistol\nIn the hood niggas running 'round acting crazy\nBuying little Air Jordans for maybe babies\nSee it might be his and it might be yours\nBecause them broads in the projects is straight up whores\nMan, it don't take much for you to get in them drawers\nYou can have them on their back or on all fours\nYou ain't got to tell me, you feeling this shit\nBecause I hear what I'm saying, I know I'm killing this shit\n\n[Chorus]\nI gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell\nI gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven\nI gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell\nI gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven"}}, {"title": "Baby By Me", "album": "Before I Self

paint a perfect picture\nI get deeper and deeper, I told ya I'd get ya\nI\u2019d work that, murk that, just the way you like it, baby\nTurn a quickie into an all-nighter maybe\nYour sex drive it match my sex drive\nThen we be moving as fast as a Nascar rides\nSwitch gears, slow down, go down, whoa now\nYou could feel every inch of it when we intimate\nI use my tongue, baby, a little sprung maybe\nI

uh, like I do it\nFeel a rush from my touch\nGet intoxicated, drunk off my love, call it Hennessy thug\nPassion, you laughin', I make you smile on the regular\nTell me what you want, shawty, and that's what I'mma get to ya\nYo, I need you to be what I need more than liquor and weed\nI need you to maybe give me a seed\nI need you to give me a reason to breathe\nI need you, I'm telling you so

out your brains\nShells hit your chest, go out your back, mane\nSee me I put in work, man, I been doing dirt for so long\nThen niggas get laid out\nNiggas run through my crib to holla at the kid\nThat's when I start bringing them thangs out\nThen we go through the strip hanging up out the whip\nDumping clips off at their whole clique, mane\nWhen witnesses around they know how we get down\nSo when the cops come they ain't see shit, mane\nMy soldiers slanging 'caine, sunny, snowy, sleet or rain\nCome through the hood and you can cop that\nI'm sittin' on some change, G-Unit that's the gang\nCome through here stunting you get popped at\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nI love to pump crack, love to stay strapped\nLove to squeeze gats, but you don't hear me though\nI love to hit the block, I

UTP, 50 Cent\nGet 'em Buck, man\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\n50 Cent, that's my name, man I ain't fucking playing\nI move on you with that Mac, mane\nCome off that watch and chain 'fore I blow out your brains\nShells hit your chest, go out your back, mane\nSee me I put in work, man, I been doing dirt for so long\nThen niggas get laid out\nNiggas run through my crib to holla at the kid\nThat's when I start bringing them thangs out\nThen we go through the strip hanging up out the whip\nDumping clips off at their whole clique, mane\nWhen witnesses around they know how we get down\nSo when the cops come they ain't see shit, mane\nMy soldiers slanging 'caine, sunny, snowy, sleet or rain\nCome through the hood and you can cop that\nI'm sittin' on some change, G-Unit that's the gang\nCome through here stunting you get popped at\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nI love to pump crack, love to stay strapped\nLove to squeeze gats, but you don't hear me though\nI love to hit the block, I love my two Glocks\nLove to bust shots, but you don't hear me though\n\n[Verse 2: Young Buck]\nI came in this game knowing niggas gon' hate me\nJust for the simple fact they know that I'm a rider\nI got a hell of a aim, I keep on telling you, mane\nI swear ain't nobody gon' find ya\nWhen I get lifted I'm tempted to tear your block up\nYour niggas can't run cause I'm behind ya\nMe and Chili in your city with a couple nine-milli's\nYou better stay in line, bro\nCause if I walk it I'll talk it, you know we'll walk up and pop it\nI love the sound of gunfire, bro\nRight now we smacking 'em with platinum\nAnd they hate it cause we made it, that's what we keep that iron for\nI represent it cause I'm in it, UTP until I'm finished\nJuvenile, they can't stop us and I admit it I live it\nI'll knock a baller off his pivot with this motherfucking chopper\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nI love to pump crack, love to stay strapped\nLove to squeeze gats, but you don't hear me though\nI love to hit the block, I love my two Glocks\nLove to bust shots, but you don't hear me though\n\n[Verse 3: 50 Cent]\nMy twenty-inches spinning, you always see me grinning\nAnd you hear niggas call me grimy\nThey hit me with them bricks and I ain't pay 'em shit\nI'm outta town, they can't find me\nWhen I come back around, man, I'mma back 'em down\nI run up busting that TEC, mane\nIf you ain't got a gun and you can't fucking run\nMy advice is you hit the deck, mane\nBut if you get away and come back another day\nMy soldiers'll leave you wet, mane\nCause we know where you be and we know where you stay\nAnd we'll come checking through your set, mane\nMan, you heard what I said, now get it in your head\nI ain't paying no fucking debt, mane\nCause you's a middle man, what don't you understand?\nYou's a fucking fake ass connect, mane\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nI love to pump crack, love to stay strapped\nLove to squeeze gats, but you don't hear me though\nI love to hit the block, I love my two Glocks\nLove to bust shots, but you don't hear me

'bout how I get my money, bitch, just know I get my money\nDon't worry 'bout I spend my money, boy, I got a lot\nDon't worry 'bout that car I drive, don't worry 'bout that bike I ride\nDon't worry 'bout them diamonds in that bezel on my watch\nDon't worry 'bout it, don't worry 'bout it\nDon't worry 'bout a mothafuckin' thing\nDon't worry 'bout it, don't worry 'bout it\nWe got a strap up in here if niggas playing\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nWhen time pass and I'm not around, niggas saying I'm out of town\nProbably moving them bricks around, they swear they know how I get down\nDon't worry 'bout what I'm doing, don't worry 'bout what I'm doing\nMy closet full of that fly shit, black card when I buy shit\nSell the shit you get high with, these niggas on my dick\nDon't worry 'bout what I'm doing, don't worry 'bout what I'm doing\nThat's your bitch, I understand, I've seen it all on Instagram\nI'm just from the past, I done been all in that ass\nDon't worry 'bout what I'm doing, don't worry 'bout what I'm doing\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]\nDon't be worry 'bout my record deals cause I still got my plug\nDon't be worry 'bout my bitch pimping, she get money out that club\nDon't be worry 'bout my partners and 'em, we get money, we eating\nYou talk shit 'bout a real nigga, bitch, you must be tweaking\nDon't be worried 'bout my whereabouts, money all I care about\nKeeping it real in my neighborhood, play with me and I'mma air it out\nWhy you worry 'bout my money, nigga? Bitch, you think I'm broke?\nThe Fed worry 'bout what I'm doing, think I'm selling dope\nI may be and I may not, go to jail I may rot\nI ain't never gon' snitch, nigga, never been no bitch nigga\nI got big guns, need a extra large, y'all niggas got question marks\nTalking down on a real nigga, that's how you get a hater charged\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: 50 Cent]\nDon't worry 'bout what they talking 'bout\nDon't tell me what that bitch done said\nI'm done with her, you can go with her\nI'm leaving here with another bitch\nDon't worry 'bout how they look at me\nMy diamonds on, damn, look at me\nThese pussy nigga be shooked at me\nWanna judge and throw the book at me\nDon't worry 'bout it, I ain't worried 'bout it\nHad time to talk to my legal team\nDon't worry 'bout it, I ain't worried 'bout it\nAin't shit they could do to me\nStill rocking, still rolling\nWe holding, bill folding, you know it\nWhen I start to ball out money start to fall out\nThrow it up, it fall out the sky\nBaddest bitches go all out, whole bar get bought out\nThat's what I call my lifestyle\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a668adee3ec6baa849ad068b4ef9bdbb.591x591x1.jpg", "artist":

'bout I spend my money, boy, I got a lot\nDon't worry 'bout that car I drive, don't worry 'bout that bike I ride\nDon't worry 'bout them diamonds in that bezel on my watch\nDon't worry 'bout it, don't worry 'bout it\nDon't worry 'bout a mothafuckin' thing\nDon't worry 'bout it, don't worry 'bout it\nWe got a strap up in here if niggas playing\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nWhen time pass and I'm not around, niggas saying I'm out of town\nProbably moving them bricks around, they swear they know how I get down\nDon't worry 'bout what I'm doing, don't worry 'bout what I'm doing\nMy closet full of that fly shit, black card when I buy shit\nSell the shit you get high with, these niggas on my dick\nDon't worry 'bout what I'm doing, don't worry 'bout what I'm doing\nThat's your bitch, I understand, I've seen it all on Instagram\nI'm just from the past, I done been all in that ass\nDon't worry 'bout what I'm doing, don't worry 'bout what I'm doing\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]\nDon't be worry 'bout my record deals cause I still got my plug\nDon't be worry 'bout my bitch pimping, she get money out that club\nDon't be worry 'bout my partners and 'em, we get money, we eating\nYou talk shit 'bout a real nigga, bitch, you must be tweaking\nDon't be worried 'bout my whereabouts, money all I care about\nKeeping it real in my neighborhood, play with me and I'mma air it out\nWhy you worry 'bout my money, nigga? Bitch, you think I'm broke?\nThe Fed worry 'bout what I'm doing, think I'm selling dope\nI may be and I may not, go to jail I may rot\nI ain't never gon' snitch, nigga, never been no bitch nigga\nI got big guns, need a extra large, y'all niggas got question marks\nTalking down on a real nigga, that's how you get a hater charged\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: 50 Cent]\nDon't worry 'bout what they talking 'bout\nDon't tell me what that bitch done said\nI'm done with her, you can go with her\nI'm leaving here with another bitch\nDon't worry 'bout how they look at me\nMy diamonds on, damn, look at me\nThese pussy nigga be shooked at me\nWanna judge and throw the book at me\nDon't worry 'bout it, I ain't worried 'bout it\nHad time to talk to my legal team\nDon't worry 'bout it, I ain't worried 'bout it\nAin't shit they could do to me\nStill rocking, still rolling\nWe holding, bill folding, you know it\nWhen I start to ball out money start to fall out\nThrow it up, it fall out the sky\nBaddest bitches go all out, whole bar get bought out\nThat's what I call my lifestyle\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "Get in My Car", "album": "The Massacre", "year": "2005-03-03", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI'm a straight guerilla with it, cold hearted killa with it\nAny nigga gettin' outta line can get it\nI make it hot, mothafuckas freeze up when I come through\nMac-10, 32 shot clip in my snorkel\nI might smile and say what's up but I don't fuck with you niggas\nMy rap money slow up, I'll run up on you niggas\nI'm on the edge, I'm just waitin' on a nigga to push me\nPut my hand on my strap, what you lookin' at pussy\nWe ain't buddies, we ain't partners and we damn sure ain't friends\nSo much chrome on my Benz, you see your face in my rims\nIf your bitch wanna roll, I'mma let her get in\nI don't play but I'm a playa 'til the mothafuckin' end\n\n[Hook]\nI got no pickup lines, I stay on the grind\nI tell the hoes all the time, bitch, get in my car (Bitch, get in)\nI got my 64, ridin' on Dayton spokes\nAnd when I open that do', bitch, get in my car\n\n[Verse 2]\nDon't tell me you don't know that, uhh, I'm the shit\nNow you better watch ya girl mane, I leave with ya bitch\nI ain't stuntin' these hoes, man I'm bout my paper\nIf your bitch really 'bout it, nigga I'm gon' take her\nBackseat of my jeep, fuck 'til I fuck up her make up\nTake her to the Diamond District, introduce her to Jacob\nTell her if she like me, she should keep me icey\nMy game fuck with a bitch brain 'til she think she wifey\nSpent her life savings in a day, cause she likes me\nCommittment from me, uhh, nah not likely\nWent out Vivica, I thought I was onto somethin'\nBut then the next week, nah, man it was nothin'\n\n[Hook]\nI got no pickup lines, I stay on the grind\nI tell the hoes all the time, bitch, get in my car (Bitch, get in)\nI got my 64, ridin' on Dayton spokes\nAnd when I open that do', bitch, get in my car\nI got no pickup lines, I stay on the grind\nI tell the hoes all the time, bitch, get in my car (Bitch, get in)\nI got my 64, ridin' on Dayton spokes\nAnd when I open that do', bitch, get in my car\n\n[Verse 3]\nLook into the windows of my soul, the eyes never lie\nThey blood shot red, it's ganja in my system, I'm high\nFirst it's pain when you lust for love, then it's smooth and calm\nFeel the rush, like a needles in your arm\nIt's a cold world baby girl, lovin' me is not enough\nFind out when you fuckin' broke, love won't get you on the bus\nMan you should see the pretty bitches that be sexin' me\nThey suck cock that make 'em hot, I just let 'em stand next to me\nHundred percent thug, freak too, I'll taste your love\n69's the position, your mouths full baby, huh?\nMy conversation's so deep, I get in your head\nNext thing you know, you yawnin', turnin' over and I'm in the bed\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro]\nHahaha\nQuit playin' bitch get in\nYou know you wanna ride with a nigga\n50 Cent\nG-G-G-G-G-Unit\nHahaha\n(Gunshots)", "image":

when I come through\nMac-10, 32 shot clip in my snorkel\nI might smile and say what's up but I don't fuck with you niggas\nMy rap money slow up, I'll run up on you niggas\nI'm on the edge, I'm just waitin' on a nigga to push me\nPut my hand on my strap, what you lookin' at pussy\nWe ain't buddies, we ain't partners and we damn sure ain't friends\nSo much chrome on my Benz, you see your face in my rims\nIf your bitch wanna roll, I'mma let her get in\nI don't play but I'm a playa 'til the mothafuckin' end\n\n[Hook]\nI got no pickup lines, I stay on the grind\nI tell the hoes all the time, bitch, get in my car (Bitch, get in)\nI got my 64, ridin' on Dayton spokes\nAnd when I open that do', bitch, get in my car\n\n[Verse 2]\nDon't tell me you don't know that, uhh, I'm the shit\nNow you better watch ya girl mane, I leave with ya bitch\nI ain't stuntin' these hoes, man I'm bout my paper\nIf your bitch really 'bout it, nigga I'm gon' take her\nBackseat of my jeep, fuck 'til I fuck up her make up\nTake her to the Diamond District, introduce her to Jacob\nTell her if she like me, she should keep me icey\nMy game fuck with a bitch brain 'til she think she wifey\nSpent her life savings in a day, cause she likes me\nCommittment from me, uhh, nah not likely\nWent out Vivica, I thought I was onto somethin'\nBut then the next week, nah, man it was nothin'\n\n[Hook]\nI got no pickup lines, I stay on the grind\nI tell the hoes all the time, bitch, get in my car (Bitch, get in)\nI got my 64, ridin' on Dayton spokes\nAnd when I open that do', bitch, get in my car\nI got no pickup lines, I stay on the grind\nI tell the hoes all the time, bitch, get in my car (Bitch, get in)\nI got my 64, ridin' on Dayton spokes\nAnd when I open that do', bitch, get in my car\n\n[Verse 3]\nLook into the windows of my soul, the eyes never lie\nThey blood shot red, it's ganja in my system, I'm high\nFirst it's pain when you lust for love, then it's smooth and calm\nFeel the rush, like a needles in your arm\nIt's a cold world baby girl, lovin' me is not enough\nFind out when you fuckin' broke, love won't get you on the bus\nMan you should see the pretty bitches that be sexin' me\nThey suck cock that make 'em hot, I just let 'em stand next to me\nHundred percent thug, freak too, I'll taste your love\n69's the position, your mouths full baby, huh?\nMy conversation's so deep, I get in your head\nNext thing you know, you yawnin', turnin' over and I'm in the bed\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro]\nHahaha\nQuit playin' bitch get in\nYou know you wanna ride with a nigga\n50

cannot deny it, oh no, no-no, no-no\nBitches be on my dick, designer threads, I'm fly as shit\nYou cannot deny it, oh no, no-no, no-no\nBetter back up off me, bitch, watch me ball (ball)\nBetter back up off me, bitch, watch me ball (ball)\nBetter back up off me, bitch, watch me ball (ball)\nBetter back up off me, bitch, watch me ball (ball)\n\n[Verse 1]\nNigga every law and every rule I break\nFeds tryna watch the moves I make\nEveryday I get birthday cake\nThere's a hundred racks there in that safe\nHundred grams there on that plate\nI ain't thinkin' 'bout catchin' no case\nNigga my safe house super safe\nI zip Giuseppe's, I don't tie no lace\nTom Ford, Y-S-L, nigga, run and tell, I'm fly as hell\nBig Bentley, Mulsanne, no LP, just two songs\nA-side, B-side, Ryder gang, bitch, that's right\nFrom N.O. to N.Y, I got shooters bitch, don't act cute and shit\nWe was born broke, no silver spoon\nMy niggas strapped, they super goons\nThese niggas here kinda soft\nWe get the bread, then fuck it off\nGet more money, then fuck it off\nMake your bitch wan' suck me off\nWe ain't had shit, we learned to ball\nThem ghetto bitches they love us all\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nShorty bounce it and she clap that\nSlide down the pole, she's a super ho\nThat gold cuban, I jack that\nYou niggas know how this 'sposed to go\nI'm in the club with niggas, I clap that\nThat P90 I pack that\nYour fuckin' head, I crack that\nYou wan' test me? Don't test me\nLook, lover boy what're you trippin' for?\nNiggas don't even want your ho\nMy nigga Ill fresh out the pen\nYou gonna make him go back again\nThem bottles coming, we turnt up\nThem sparks burnin' now watch us shine\nYou do this shit once a year\nWe do this shit all the time\nNow captain come and save her\nGet her from around this paper\nShe'll never be the same\nI mean like everything will change\nShe cute blow a little cheese on her\nGet her ass shots, throw D's on her\nThem shoes more than you think though\nMy bitch look like my bank roll\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "I

I don't know, I don't know who got you\nI don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you\nI don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you\nBut you think I know cause you know how my squad do\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nNowadays niggas snitchin' so much in the street\nThat you gotta talk to them like they the police\nNah, I don't know nothin 'bout poppin the heat\nI don't know nothin 'bout settlin no beef in the streets\nNah, I don't know nothin 'bout baggin the grams\nI ain't never had no spot or went hand to hand\nMe, I don't know nothin 'bout takin the stand\nI ain't never got a nigga ass stuck in the can\nNah, I don't know nothin 'bout dro or hash\nCoke, dope, x, dust or crystal meth\nNah, I'm just tryin to rap to get some cash\nKeep the Hip Hop Police off my ass\n\n[Hook: Prodigy]\nNah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you\nI don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you\nI don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you\nBut you think I know cause you know how my squad do\n\n[Verse 2: Prodigy]\nAiyyo, that's my word on the stack of bibles\nI don't know who did it I don't know who responsible\nAll I know who spittin all I know who givin\nMe all this cash, just to put down twelve to get in yo' ass\nListen, keep it far away from me\nI ain't got time for sittin in the penitentiary\nAll I know is I'm rich, all I know is that G-Unit work\nWhen the album drop they go bezerk\nMad video play, crazy radio spins\nNumber one all the time, our reign never ends\nDon't point the finger at us somebody's hangin\nThey had a beef with us, plus we don't know nathin\n\n[Chorus: Spider Loc\nNah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you\nI don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you\nI don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you\nBut you think I know cause you know how my squad do\n\n[Verse 3: Spider Loc]\nI don't know nothin 'bout jumpin out splittin homeboy head\nBut for real that's fucked up they say that homeboy dead\nI can't even think, who 'gon want him dead\nHave no idea what type of gun they done him with\nYou see I hear no evil and I see no evil\nAin't tryin to talk to or hear from or see those people\nAnd I ain't had them little homies burn up no regal\nI've been tryin to do this music thang and just go legal\nI don't know why my name in your female's phone\nBut you really startin to sound like a female holmes\nDon't know why they told you that we sell stones\nWe on the internet tryin to get our Email on\n\n[Hook: Lloyd Banks]\nNah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you\nI don't

know who sent them young boys through\nTo air the strip, shit just be happenin out the blue\nI don't be around here, I ain't hip to the news\nI don't know why that man clutchin on that shit when you move\nI don't know why that other rapper got stripped for his jewels\nYou know how easy it is to get shit confused\nI wasn't even in New York, I was just in the cruise\nSomewhere way out in the islands with your bitch in the cruise\nOops my bitch in the cruise, dudes get hit when they snooze\nLose they hit from the Uz, Uz all over the street\nI don't know why they said what's up I don't know who's in that jeep\nHe talk about me all day but I ain't losin no sleep\n\n[Hook: Mase]\nNah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you\nI don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you\nI don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you\nBut you think I know cause you know how my squad do\n\n[Verse 5: Mase]\nI don't know why my charm 'bout as big as your palm\nAnd why the diamond chain I wear as 'bout as long as your arm\nYou tell me, how many diamonds in my bezel\nThere's one for everytime I had to grind up in the ghetto\nI could show you how to do it, you tired of ridin Buicks\nI don't know why niggas rap for years and can't make hotter music\nEven when, I don't do it chicks release body fluid\nBody drop, shotty pop, and niggas wanna tie me to it\nI don't know why Loon and Fabby won't just say I'm they daddy\nWhy them Harlem CB4 niggas just keep comin at me\nGot as many beefs as 50 and a nigga go to church\nCould you imagine if my hands was on work, I don't know\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nNah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you\nI don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you\nI don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you\nBut you think

Cent]\nNah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you\nI don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you\nI don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you\nBut you think I know cause you know how my squad do\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nNowadays niggas snitchin' so much in the street\nThat you gotta talk to them like they the police\nNah, I don't know nothin 'bout poppin the heat\nI don't know nothin 'bout settlin no beef in the streets\nNah, I don't know nothin 'bout baggin the grams\nI ain't never had no spot or went hand to hand\nMe, I don't know nothin 'bout takin the stand\nI ain't never got a nigga ass stuck in the can\nNah, I don't know nothin 'bout dro or hash\nCoke, dope, x, dust or crystal meth\nNah, I'm just tryin to rap to get some cash\nKeep the Hip Hop Police off my ass\n\n[Hook: Prodigy]\nNah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you\nI don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you\nI don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you\nBut you think I know cause you know how my squad do\n\n[Verse 2: Prodigy]\nAiyyo, that's my word on the stack of bibles\nI don't know who did it I don't know who responsible\nAll I know who spittin all I know who givin\nMe all this cash, just to put down twelve to get in yo' ass\nListen, keep it far away from me\nI ain't got time for sittin in the penitentiary\nAll I know is I'm rich, all I know is that G-Unit work\nWhen the album drop they go bezerk\nMad video play, crazy radio spins\nNumber one all the time, our reign never ends\nDon't point the finger at us somebody's hangin\nThey had a beef with us, plus we don't know nathin\n\n[Chorus: Spider Loc\nNah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you\nI don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you\nI don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you\nBut you think I know cause you know how my squad do\n\n[Verse 3: Spider Loc]\nI don't know nothin 'bout jumpin out splittin homeboy head\nBut for real that's fucked up they say that homeboy dead\nI can't even think, who 'gon want him dead\nHave no idea what type of gun they done him with\nYou see I hear no evil and I see no evil\nAin't tryin to talk to or hear from or see those people\nAnd I ain't had them little homies burn up no regal\nI've been tryin to do this music thang and just go legal\nI don't know why my name in your female's phone\nBut you really startin to sound like a female holmes\nDon't know why they told you that we sell stones\nWe on the internet tryin to get our Email on\n\n[Hook: Lloyd Banks]\nNah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you\nI don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you\nI don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you\nBut you think I know cause you know how my squad do\n\n[Verse 4: Lloyd Banks]\nNah nigga I don't know who sent them young boys through\nTo air the strip, shit just be happenin out the blue\nI don't be around here, I ain't hip to the news\nI don't know why that man clutchin on that shit when you move\nI don't know why that other rapper got stripped for his jewels\nYou know how easy it is to get shit confused\nI wasn't even in New York, I was just in the cruise\nSomewhere way out in the islands with your bitch in the cruise\nOops my bitch in the cruise, dudes get hit when they snooze\nLose they hit from the Uz, Uz all over the street\nI don't know why they said what's up I don't know who's in that jeep\nHe talk about me all day but I ain't losin no sleep\n\n[Hook: Mase]\nNah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you\nI don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you\nI don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you\nBut you think I know cause you know how my squad do\n\n[Verse 5: Mase]\nI don't know why my charm 'bout as big as your palm\nAnd why the diamond chain I wear as 'bout as long as your arm\nYou tell me, how many diamonds in my bezel\nThere's one for everytime I had to grind up in the ghetto\nI could show you how to do it, you tired of ridin Buicks\nI don't know why niggas rap for years and can't make hotter music\nEven when, I don't do it chicks release body fluid\nBody drop, shotty pop, and niggas wanna tie me to it\nI don't know why Loon and Fabby won't just say I'm they daddy\nWhy them Harlem CB4 niggas just keep comin at me\nGot as many beefs as 50 and a nigga go to church\nCould you imagine if my hands was on work, I don't know\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nNah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you\nI don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you\nI don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you\nBut you think I know cause you know how my squad do"}}, {"title": "Niggas", "album": "God's Plan", "year": "2002-11-01", "lyrics": "[Intro: Puff Daddy]\nShadyville Entertainment\nBad Boy

the shit\nBut there's one thing about niggas I do not love\n\n[Notorious B.I.G.]\nTo all my Brooklyn\nTo all my Uptown\nTo all my Bronx\nTo all my Queensbridge\n\n[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]\nBack up chump, you know Biggie Smalls rip it quick\nAnd kicks it quick - you know how black niggas get\nWith them hoods, fatigues; with the boots with trees\nSmoking weed, flipping keys, making crazy G's\nHitting buckshots at niggas that open spots\nOn the avenue, take my loot, and I'm bagging you, huh\nPimping hoes that drive Volvos and Rodeos\nFlash the roll, make them wet in their pantyhose\nDamn, a nigga style is unorthodox\nGrip the Glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks\nJust in case a nigga wanna act out\nI just black out, and blow they motherfucking back out\nThat's a real nigga\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent] (x2)\nWe the realest nigga\n50 Cent and B.I.G. my nigga\nDon't try to act like you don't feel us nigga\nBiggie yo' nigga, 50 yo' nigga\nSqueeze the trigger, leave a nigga fo' sho'!\n\n[Verse 2: Notorious B.I.G.]\nYo, we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths\nJust in case Dread wanna riff\nHe get a free lift to the cemetery, rough very\nNot your ordinary, we watch you get buried\nThat's a real nigga for ya'\nGet mad do a quarter, flip the script, and rip your lawyer\nSpit at the D.A., because fuck what she say\nShe don't give a fuck about your ass anyway\nUp North bound first stop, Watertown or Fishscale\nWhere the hand skills are real ill\nYou'll be a super Hoover doo-doo stain remover\nHa-ha, yo chief, pass the buddha\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: 50 Cent]\nWhen I was young my M.O. was to go hand in hand\nEven my P.O., she called me \"the Ginger Bread Man\"\nI catch a new case, and tell her ass: \"Catch me if you can\"\nDon't let your people fill you up with octane, I'm not playing\nGet gassed up, to get blast up\nReal B.I.G. style watch the kid break it down\nCheck it: thou shalt not fuck with, nor see Poppa\n50 Cent, I'll break yo' punk ass off proper\nThere's no place like home, New York! New York!\nI run this city, and I don't dance around like Diddy\nNiggas is giddy, till they're smacked silly\nOr sprayed with the MAC milli, they don't want drama really\nPussy niggas get hard, lip syncing my lyrics, like Milli Vanilli\nIn the hood they feel me {*Gun cock*} ha! I'm on fire!\nNiggas out in Philly they feel me, they bump my shit {*Gunshot*}\nEvery bootlegger you know, pump my shit - bitch!\n\n[Hook]", "image":

vocals]\nI love niggas, I love niggas\nBecause niggas are me\nAnd I should only love that which is me\nI love to see niggas go through changes\nI love to see niggas shoot the shit\nBut there's one thing about niggas I do not love\n\n[Notorious B.I.G.]\nTo all my Brooklyn\nTo all my Uptown\nTo all my Bronx\nTo all my Queensbridge\n\n[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]\nBack up chump, you know Biggie Smalls rip it quick\nAnd kicks it quick - you know how black niggas get\nWith them hoods, fatigues; with the boots with trees\nSmoking weed, flipping keys, making crazy G's\nHitting buckshots at niggas that open spots\nOn the avenue, take my loot, and I'm bagging you, huh\nPimping hoes that drive Volvos and Rodeos\nFlash the roll, make them wet in their pantyhose\nDamn, a nigga style is unorthodox\nGrip the Glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks\nJust in case a nigga wanna act out\nI just black out, and blow they motherfucking back out\nThat's a real nigga\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent] (x2)\nWe the realest nigga\n50 Cent and B.I.G. my nigga\nDon't try to act like you don't feel us nigga\nBiggie yo' nigga, 50 yo' nigga\nSqueeze the trigger, leave a nigga fo' sho'!\n\n[Verse 2: Notorious B.I.G.]\nYo, we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths\nJust in case Dread wanna riff\nHe get a free lift to the cemetery, rough very\nNot your ordinary, we watch you get buried\nThat's a real nigga for ya'\nGet mad do a quarter, flip the script, and rip your lawyer\nSpit at the D.A., because fuck what she say\nShe don't give a fuck about your ass anyway\nUp North bound first stop, Watertown or Fishscale\nWhere the hand skills are real ill\nYou'll be a super Hoover doo-doo stain remover\nHa-ha, yo chief, pass the buddha\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: 50 Cent]\nWhen I was young my M.O. was to go hand in hand\nEven my P.O., she called me \"the Ginger Bread Man\"\nI catch a new case, and tell her ass: \"Catch me if you can\"\nDon't let your people fill you up with octane, I'm not playing\nGet gassed up, to get blast up\nReal B.I.G. style watch the kid break it down\nCheck it: thou shalt not fuck with, nor see Poppa\n50 Cent, I'll break yo' punk ass off proper\nThere's no place like home, New York! New York!\nI run this city, and I don't dance around like Diddy\nNiggas is giddy, till they're smacked silly\nOr sprayed with the MAC milli, they don't want drama really\nPussy niggas get hard, lip syncing my lyrics, like Milli Vanilli\nIn the hood they feel me {*Gun cock*} ha! I'm on fire!\nNiggas out in Philly they feel me, they bump my shit {*Gunshot*}\nEvery bootlegger you know, pump my shit - bitch!\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "In My Hood", "album": "The Massacre", "year": "2005-03-03", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nNiggas screw they face up at me\nOn some real shit son they don\u2019t want beef\nI cock that, aim that shit out the window and spray\nThere ain\u2019t a shell left in my heat\nY\u2019all niggas better lay down, yeah, I mean stay down\nYou get hit with AK round, your ass ain\u2019t gon\u2019 make it\nYou niggas will get laid out, your blood and your brains out\nHave you on the concrete shivering and shaking\nI\u2019m from Southside motherfucker, where them gats explode\nIf you feel like you\u2019re on fire, boy drop and roll\nNiggas will eat your ass up, cause they heart turned cold\nNow you can be a victim or you can lock and load\nThe party jump, shorty bouncin that ass, I wanna fuck\nGimme a second I\u2019mma holla, I\u2019mma see whassup\nI got my razor in my hand, got my pistol in the trunk\nCarve your ass up nice you play me like a punk\n\n[Chorus]\nIn my hood niggas got love for me\nBut I don\u2019t go nowhere without my strap\nIn my hood a little \u2019dro, a little Hennessy\nAnd niggas just don\u2019t know how to act\nIn my hood niggas is grimey\nI stay on point, I roll with my gat\nIn my hood niggas might buck at me\nSo I keep something around to buck back\nIn my hood\n\n[Verse 2]\nI don\u2019t trust a muh\u2019fuckin soul\nWhen the D\u2019s come they fold, on my first case they told\nWhere I\u2019m from it ain\u2019t safe to have more than a eighth\nNiggas\u2019ll come to your place, put a gun in your face\nTell you open the safe, as your heart start to race\nCause a robbery could turn into a homo\u2019 case\nCo-operate, or Doc\u2019ll have to operate\nNiggas I\u2019ll pop you, run a light then pop at Jake\nTrust me son, niggas\u2019ll go hard for that cake\nThese thirsty niggas are lurking, you\u2019ll have to catch \u2019em and merk\u00a0\u2019em\nI\u2019m observing in my hood, cause niggas be dumbing\nShots forfeit the dice game, all you see is the running\nThey make it harder and harder to pump on the block\nI\u2019m a hustler, how the fuck I\u2019m \u2019sposed to eat when it\u2019s hot?\n\n[Chorus]\nIn my hood niggas got love for me\nBut I don\u2019t go nowhere without my strap\nIn my hood a little \u2019dro, a little Hennessy\nAnd niggas just don\u2019t know how to act\nIn my hood niggas is grimey\nI stay on point, I roll with my gat\nIn my hood niggas might buck at me\nSo I keep something around to buck back\nIn my hood\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe house party off the hook until them shots go off\nWell that\u2019s what you get for stuntin on my block showoff\nYou shit out of luck if niggas catch you slippin\nCrack money slow so you know niggas is trippin\nShorty down there on that Queens tracks takin a whippin\nSheeit, bitch get out of pocket, she need some discipline\nPeep the fiend shootin diesel in his arm in the alley\nLook at the chrome spinner spinnin on that black Denali\nThe grimey niggas where I\u2019m from don\u2019t wanna see you chipped\u00a0up\nYou shy nigga on jux, you about to shoot your whip up\nIt ain\u2019t good to do good in my hood\n*Click-clack, blam* You know not to do good now\n\n[Chorus]\nIn my hood niggas got love for me\nBut I don\u2019t go nowhere without my strap\nIn my hood a little \u2019dro, a little Hennessy\nAnd niggas just don\u2019t know how to act\nIn my hood niggas is grimey\nI stay on point, I roll with my gat\nIn my hood niggas might buck at me\nSo I keep something around to buck back\nIn my hood", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ca36dfbff5c6dfcea453afdb61476f86.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "50 Cent", "raw": {"annotation_count": 13, "api_path": "/songs/2830", "apple_music_id": "1228882340", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/2830/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "The second track of 50 Cent\u2019s 2005 album, \u201cThe  Massacre\u201d.

ain\u2019t gon\u2019 make it\nYou niggas will get laid out, your blood and your brains out\nHave you on the concrete shivering and shaking\nI\u2019m from Southside motherfucker, where them gats explode\nIf you feel like you\u2019re on fire, boy drop and roll\nNiggas will eat your ass up, cause they heart turned cold\nNow you can be a victim or you can lock and load\nThe party jump, shorty bouncin that ass, I wanna fuck\nGimme a second I\u2019mma holla, I\u2019mma see whassup\nI got my razor in my hand, got my pistol in the trunk\nCarve your ass up nice you play me like a punk\n\n[Chorus]\nIn my hood niggas got love for me\nBut I don\u2019t go nowhere without my strap\nIn my hood a little \u2019dro, a little Hennessy\nAnd niggas just don\u2019t know how to act\nIn my hood niggas is grimey\nI stay on point, I roll with my gat\nIn my hood niggas might buck at me\nSo I keep something around to buck back\nIn my hood\n\n[Verse 2]\nI don\u2019t trust a muh\u2019fuckin soul\nWhen the D\u2019s come they fold, on my first case they told\nWhere I\u2019m from it ain\u2019t safe to have more than a eighth\nNiggas\u2019ll come to your place, put a gun in your face\nTell you open the safe, as your heart start to race\nCause a robbery could turn into a homo\u2019 case\nCo-operate, or Doc\u2019ll have to operate\nNiggas I\u2019ll pop you, run a light then pop at Jake\nTrust me son, niggas\u2019ll go hard for that cake\nThese thirsty niggas are lurking, you\u2019ll have to catch \u2019em and merk\u00a0\u2019em\nI\u2019m observing in my hood, cause niggas be dumbing\nShots forfeit the dice game, all you see is the running\nThey make it harder and harder to pump on the block\nI\u2019m a hustler, how the fuck I\u2019m \u2019sposed to eat when it\u2019s hot?\n\n[Chorus]\nIn my hood niggas got love for me\nBut I don\u2019t go nowhere without my strap\nIn my hood a little \u2019dro, a little Hennessy\nAnd niggas just don\u2019t know how to act\nIn my hood niggas is grimey\nI stay on point, I roll with my gat\nIn my hood niggas might buck at me\nSo I keep something around to buck back\nIn my hood\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe house party off the hook until them shots go off\nWell that\u2019s what you get for stuntin on my block showoff\nYou shit out of luck if niggas catch you slippin\nCrack money slow so you know niggas is trippin\nShorty down there on that Queens tracks takin a whippin\nSheeit, bitch get out of pocket, she need some discipline\nPeep the fiend shootin diesel in his arm in the alley\nLook at the chrome spinner spinnin on that black Denali\nThe grimey niggas where I\u2019m from don\u2019t wanna see you chipped\u00a0up\nYou shy nigga on jux, you about to shoot your whip up\nIt ain\u2019t good to do good in my hood\n*Click-clack, blam* You know not to do good now\n\n[Chorus]\nIn my hood niggas got love for me\nBut I don\u2019t go nowhere without my strap\nIn my hood a little \u2019dro, a little Hennessy\nAnd niggas just don\u2019t know how to act\nIn my hood niggas is grimey\nI stay on point, I roll with my gat\nIn my hood niggas might buck at me\nSo I keep something around to buck back\nIn my hood"}}, {"title":

Them niggas pussy. Sucka ass niggas. I don't like either one (I don't even like 'em). But the other night I'm in the gambling spot. Nigga come up in here - boom - hit the door. \"Get the fuck on the floor, bitch, get down on the floor.\" I turn around like, \"what?\" Niggas like, \"get down!\" (When was this?) I'm like, \"nigga, I got on white linen.\"\n\n[Intro]\nFuck it, I mean we gotta kill what we eat, right? It's not a problem, it's really not a problem.

my face\nGod make me shine like the sun\nGod make me shine like the sun\nSometimes I feel like I'm the one\nSometimes I feel like I'm the one\n\n[Bridge]\nIt ain't my fault, I just reach for style\nI'm hot, I breaks it down\nIt ain't my fault, you can't break it down\nThe way I break it down\n\n[Verse 1]\nListen, you can call me what you want, black and ugly\nBut you can't convince me the Lord don't love me\nWhen my CD's drop, they sell the best\nYou call it luck, why can't it just be I'm blessed\nI'm a track star runnin' through life chasin' my dreams\nBest deal I made was tradin' the mic for that triple beam\nI zone off thinkin' is there really heaven or hell\nIf so what happens to a changed man that dies in a cell?\nI need no answers to these questions, 'cause time will tell\nGot a date with destiny, she's more than a girl\nDon't much good come from me, but my music\nIt's a gift given from God, so I'ma use it - yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nGod gave me style, God gave me grace\nGod give me style, God give me grace\nGod put a smile on my face\nHa-ha, God put this smile on my face\nGod make me shine like the sun\nGod make me shine like the sun\nSometimes I feel like I'm the one\nSometimes I feel like I'm the one\n\n[Bridge]\nIt ain't my fault, I just reach for style\nI'm hot, I breaks it down\nIt ain't my fault, you can't break it down\nThe way I break it down\n\n[Verse 2]\nSome days I'm in the crowd, all by myself\nBunch of niggas around, I'm still by myself\nI drift off on a cloud, by myself\nThinkin 'bout nothin more, than life - what else?\nThese days it's hard to tell who really cares for me\nSo when you hear this song, you should say a prayer for me\nI put a message in my music, hope it brightens your day\nIf times are hard when you hear it, know you'll be okay\nA O.G. told me God's favorites have a hard time\nYou're out the hood, that's good, now stay on the grind\nI'm a sponge, knowledge, and wisdom I ab-sorb fast\nI'm in a class by myself, you do the math\n\n[Chorus]\nGod gave me style, God gave me grace\nGod give me style, God give me grace\nGod put a smile on my face\nHa-ha, God put this smile on my face\nGod make me shine like the sun\nGod make me shine like the sun\nSometimes I feel like I'm the one\nSometimes I feel like I'm the one\n\n[Outro]\n(It ain't my fault) yeah\nShoutout to Reverand Floyd Flake\n(It ain't my fault) Creflo Dollar, TD Jakes\nBishop Eddie L. Long. Easy-L shorty. Ha ha\nWooo! Feels good\nOh yeah, can't forget Bishop Morton\nCause my mama'll kill me, ha ha"}}, {"title": "I'm a Hustler", "album": "Power of the Dollar", "year": null, "lyrics": "[Produced by DJ Scratch]\n\n[Verse 1]\nRule number one: Don't go against the grain\nRule number two: Give respect where respect due\nRule number three: If you get knocked, play games and say names\nThe 45 will tear you out the frame\nIt's like the rich get richer and the poor don't get fucking thing\nFor me ain't nothin' changed, but the things my money brings\nMy style will leave you aggy like them cats in jail\nYou peoples got plenty money actin like they ain't got bail\nI feel for you niggas gettin' shot while I'm sayin' this rhyme\nOr niggas in the mess hall gettin' chopped on chow lines\nAn old timer schooled me, said: \"Don't burn bridges, my friend\nImagine the G-Dub close and yo' ass gotta swim\"\nI watch the fifth melt a nigga on the sidewalk in New York\nMe and shorty stood from a far and had a talk\nHe said \"I told em if he came around I'd clap him, I gave him my word\nLook at his head its still shakin' he had a lot of nerve\"\n\n[Hook]\nIf it wasn't for the flow\nI'd probably have to double back, bubble crack\nI'm a hustler\nIf it wasn't for the flow\nI'd probably have to double back, bubble crack\nI'm a hustler\n\n[Verse 2]\nYo when the Feds come in the game, loyalty is limited\nHardcore niggas start actin' feminine\nWith the Feds you do eighty five percent of your time\nDuke, you get ten, you'll damn near do nine\nI hate a liar more than I hate thief\nA thief is only after my salary, a liar is after my reality\nThe streets I know'em like my ABC's\nStay away from the D's and stack ya' cheese\nTry to see three hundred G's before you see 300Z's\nTree top to feel the breeze, coke connect for key's\nYo' bitches sexin' me, take me to ecstacy\nOnce I nut, I don't want 'em next to me\nIf it's on, mother fucker, believe I'mma ride\nI'm the type to swallow my blood before I swallow my pride\nLetters on my sweater read DKNY\nGot grimy niggas runnin' with me from BKNY\n\n[Hook]\nIf it wasn't for the flow\nI'd probably have to double back, bubble crack\nI'm a hustler\nIf it wasn't for the flow\nI'd probably have to double back, bubble crack\nI'm a hustler\n\n[Verse 3]\nThey say I don't sound like a killer, well how a killer sound?\nI bet I grab a 4-pound and back that ass down\nSee many men live, baby, and many men die\nMany men get drunk, puff lye and stay high\nHere's a jewel: love you enemies and hate your friends\nYour enemies remain the same, friends always change\nI learned quick that there's more than one way to skin a cat\nYou can get 'em in the face, dog, or down his back\nAll bullshit aside now, its time to be honest\nI fear no man, for death is all that's promised\nI got niggas standin' in line waitin' to hear me spit\nFrom '86 to '96 the game went from sugar to shit\nThis for you niggas in the background dyin' to shine\nI hate you like fiends who ask for a dime for nine\nAin't nothin' changed in the game, but faces and names\nThe state, the weight, the date and the jake\n\n[Hook]\nIf it wasn't for the flow\nI'd probably have to double back, bubble crack\nI'm a hustler\nIf it wasn't for the flow\nI'd probably have to double back, bubble crack\nI'm a hustler", "image":

grain\nRule number two: Give respect where respect due\nRule number three: If you get knocked, play games and say names\nThe 45 will tear you out the frame\nIt's like the rich get richer and the poor don't get fucking thing\nFor me ain't nothin' changed, but the things my money brings\nMy style will leave you aggy like them cats in jail\nYou peoples got plenty money actin like they ain't got bail\nI feel for you niggas gettin' shot while I'm sayin' this rhyme\nOr niggas in the mess hall gettin' chopped on chow lines\nAn old timer schooled me, said: \"Don't burn bridges, my friend\nImagine the G-Dub close and yo' ass gotta swim\"\nI watch the fifth melt a nigga on the sidewalk in New York\nMe and shorty stood from a far and had a talk\nHe said \"I told em if he came around I'd clap him, I gave him my word\nLook at his head its still shakin' he had a lot of nerve\"\n\n[Hook]\nIf it wasn't for the flow\nI'd probably have to double back, bubble crack\nI'm a hustler\nIf it wasn't for the flow\nI'd probably have to double back, bubble crack\nI'm a hustler\n\n[Verse 2]\nYo when the Feds come in the game, loyalty is limited\nHardcore niggas start actin' feminine\nWith the Feds you do eighty five percent of your time\nDuke, you get ten, you'll damn near do nine\nI hate a liar more than I hate thief\nA thief is only after my salary, a liar is after my reality\nThe streets I know'em like my ABC's\nStay away from the D's and stack ya' cheese\nTry to see three hundred G's before you see 300Z's\nTree top to feel the breeze, coke connect for key's\nYo' bitches sexin' me, take me to ecstacy\nOnce I nut, I don't want 'em next to me\nIf it's on, mother fucker, believe I'mma ride\nI'm the type to swallow my blood before I swallow my pride\nLetters on my sweater read DKNY\nGot grimy niggas runnin' with me from BKNY\n\n[Hook]\nIf it wasn't for the flow\nI'd probably have to double back, bubble crack\nI'm a hustler\nIf it wasn't for the flow\nI'd probably have to double back, bubble crack\nI'm a hustler\n\n[Verse 3]\nThey say I don't sound like a killer, well how a killer sound?\nI bet I grab a 4-pound and back that ass down\nSee many men live, baby, and many men die\nMany men get drunk, puff lye and stay high\nHere's a jewel: love you enemies and hate your friends\nYour enemies remain the same, friends always change\nI learned quick that there's more than one way to skin a cat\nYou can get 'em in the face, dog, or down his back\nAll bullshit aside now, its time to be honest\nI fear no man, for death is all that's promised\nI got niggas standin' in line waitin' to hear me spit\nFrom '86 to '96 the game went from sugar to shit\nThis for you niggas in the background dyin' to shine\nI hate you like fiends who ask for a dime for nine\nAin't nothin' changed in the game, but faces and names\nThe state, the weight, the date and the jake\n\n[Hook]\nIf it wasn't for the flow\nI'd probably have to double back, bubble crack\nI'm a hustler\nIf it wasn't for the flow\nI'd probably have to double back, bubble crack\nI'm a hustler"}}, {"title": "Like My Style", "album": "Get Rich or Die Tryin\u2019", "year": "2003-02-06", "lyrics": "[Produced by Rockwilder]\n\n[Intro]\nI know you like my style\nYou like how I break it down\nI know you like style\nYou like how I break it down\nI know you like my style\nYou like how I break it down\nWanna get rich I'll show you how\nWanna get rich I'll show you how\n\n[Verse 1]\nOn ya mark, get set, let's go, switch the flow\nTeach ya how to turn Yayo into dough\nThe original don dada, nobody bomb harder\nYa heard what I said boy, I'm hot, I'm hot\nThe hoodrats they say \"He so crazy\"\nThe snitches they say \"He tried to spray me\"\nThat's what you get for trying to play me\nThe aftermath and my wrath is so shady\nNo matter how you try you can't stop it\nI catch ya stunting in the Bentley Coup\u00e9 cockpit\nIf you a pimp why ya hoes stay outta pocket?\nFront and find out how my P-40 Glock hit\n[Yayo] \"50 you need some help?\"\nChill, Yayo I got this\nWhere I'm from the D's tryin' to knock us\nThey swear to God that it's me selling the choppers\nMan, I ain't give them little niggas no product\n\n[Hook]\nI know you like my style\nBut how much do you like my style?\nYou like how I break it down\nWanna get rich I'll show you how\n\n[Bridge]\nThe birds they say I got a way with words\nI be like \"baby girl, I like them curves\"\nIf ya not busy tonight then we can swerve\nI'mma bachelor, baby, fuck what you heard\n\n[Verse 2]\nFrom the tellie in ten minutes I'll make you a believer\nTongue touch ya, I'll have ya shakin' like you havin' a seizure\nI make hits about what I do in my leisure\nG-Unit gang, can't another clique out there see us\nNiggas lip sync the lyrics cause they wanna be us\nGroupie hoes from the hood they be trying to G us\nTrying to holla at the kid every time they see us\nGirlfriend quit pretending, I'm the nigga ya love\nAnd I ain't got to say nothing, you know that I'm thugging\nPut my hands on that ass and ya say that I'm bugging\nWe family, baby, kissing cousins\nNow look what the riff raff done drug in\nFor the cheese my degrees is hotter then ya oven\nI'm a New Yorker, but I sound Southern\nAnd we sip DP 'till the Don stop bubblin'\nAfter we play, ok, go to ya husband\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Bridge]\nEm said you gone like my style\nDre said you gone like my style\nI said you gone like my style\nYou gone like how I break it down\n\n[Outro: Tony Yayo]\nYou're not really, really ready\nThe drama will have ya ass in trauma, boy\nYou're not really, really ready\nMy knife flip open and then I gets to poking\nYou're not really, really ready\nThem shells start popping and bodies get to dropping\nYou're not really, really ready\nYou think ya ready, ya not\nReally really ready", "image": "https://images.genius.com/17bdb55979efe915f90e0fa67b92ad61.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "50 Cent", "raw": {"annotation_count": 25, "api_path":

it down\nI know you like style\nYou like how I break it down\nI know you like my style\nYou like how I break it down\nWanna get rich I'll show you how\nWanna get rich I'll show you how\n\n[Verse 1]\nOn ya mark, get set, let's go, switch the flow\nTeach ya how to turn Yayo into dough\nThe original don dada, nobody bomb harder\nYa heard what I said boy, I'm hot, I'm hot\nThe hoodrats they say \"He so crazy\"\nThe snitches they say \"He tried to spray me\"\nThat's what you get for trying to play me\nThe aftermath and my wrath is so shady\nNo matter how you try you can't stop it\nI catch ya stunting in the Bentley Coup\u00e9 cockpit\nIf you a pimp why ya hoes stay outta pocket?\nFront and find out how my P-40 Glock hit\n[Yayo] \"50 you need some help?\"\nChill, Yayo I got this\nWhere I'm from the D's tryin' to knock us\nThey swear to God that it's me selling the choppers\nMan, I ain't give them little niggas no product\n\n[Hook]\nI know you like my style\nBut how much do you like my style?\nYou like how I break it down\nWanna get rich I'll show you how\n\n[Bridge]\nThe birds they say I got a way with words\nI be like \"baby girl, I like them curves\"\nIf ya not busy tonight then we can swerve\nI'mma bachelor, baby, fuck what you heard\n\n[Verse 2]\nFrom the tellie in ten minutes I'll make you a believer\nTongue touch ya, I'll have ya shakin' like you havin' a seizure\nI make hits about what I do in my leisure\nG-Unit gang, can't another clique out there see us\nNiggas lip sync the lyrics cause they wanna be us\nGroupie hoes from the hood they be trying to G us\nTrying to holla at the kid every time they see us\nGirlfriend quit pretending, I'm the nigga ya love\nAnd I ain't got to say nothing, you know that I'm thugging\nPut my hands on that ass and ya say that I'm bugging\nWe family, baby, kissing cousins\nNow look what the riff raff done drug in\nFor the cheese my degrees is hotter then ya oven\nI'm a New Yorker, but I sound Southern\nAnd we sip DP 'till the Don stop bubblin'\nAfter we play, ok, go to ya husband\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Bridge]\nEm said you gone like my style\nDre said you gone like my style\nI said you gone like my style\nYou gone like how I break it down\n\n[Outro: Tony Yayo]\nYou're not really, really ready\nThe drama will have ya ass in trauma, boy\nYou're not really, really ready\nMy knife flip open and then I gets to poking\nYou're not really, really ready\nThem shells start popping and bodies get to dropping\nYou're not really, really ready\nYou think ya ready, ya not\nReally really ready"}}, {"title": "Position of Power", "album":

do you think, do-do-do you think about me?\nDo you, do you, do you, do you think about me?\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nYou think about money when you think about me, huh?\nIt's why my ex my ex, you don't wanna be her\nShe used to have the Beemer, now she own a sneaker\nI had her eating lobster, now she eating pizza\nI think about Easter when I think about Keyshia\nShorty stay fly, that's why I keep her\nRound like the reefer, brown Mona Lisa\nShe good if I leave her, she got her own Visa\nThink about them when you think about fronting\nThink about stunting when you think about me\nI'm the boss, Bentley or the Porsche?\nOverseas see jet ski's slide across\nI love the way you dress, now take it off\nPut your legs high on my shoulders of course\nI'm racing through your mind, but you already lost\nI'm at the finish line and you're a friend of mine\nCome on, let's ride\n\n[Hook: Governor]\n(Do you think about me?)\nJust a little bit, every now and then\n(Do you think about me?)\nGoddamn girl, we used to be friends\n(Do you think about me?)\nJust a little bit, just a little bit\n(Do you think about me?)\nJust a little bit, just a little bit\n(Do you think about me?)\n\n[Verse 2: 50 Cent]\nI think like a hustler, I'm thinking 'bout a shipment\nShe thinking I'm her hustler, she thinking 'bout commitment\nIt's like Paul McCartney's stuck in my head\nHe fell in love with a bitch who walked away on one leg\nShe ain't even have to run to get away with the bread\nThat's some fucked up shit, think about that, kid\nI'm thinking what this bitch thinking when she take me to court\nI pay my child support, what the fuck she want?\"\nThis relationship shit is too much for me\nI wanna fuck, be friends and live comfortably\nShe wanna shine and blow mines on shopping spree's\nShe should have what she want, just not from me\nI'm thinking 'bout my future, she brought up my past\nShe don't care about me, she just want some cash\nI'm thinking damn, girl, we used to be friends\nHow did shit become all about ends?\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Governor]\nDo you think about me? (Do you think about me?)\nI know you think about me\nYou got to remember all the good times we had\nJust a little bit, just a little bit\nJust a little bit, just a little bit\nJust a little bit, just a little bit\nJust a little bit\n(Do you think about me?)\nI remember when you told me\n(I know you think about me)\nThat I'll always be special to you, darling\nYou were so special to me, do you think about me?"}}, {"title": "Outta Control", "album": "The Massacre", "year": "2005-03-03", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nYeah, Shady, Aftermath\nI - guess - you didn't know\nI - be - back for more\nEvery-body's - on the floor\nGoin goin outta control\nSet it off on yo' left, dog\nSet it off on yo' right, dog\nSet it off\nNigga I said set it off!\n\n[Verse 1]\nHa ha...\nSick with it, boy better get with it, what?\nIn the club I get it goin, goin, uh\nJust movin to the music it's on\nAnd the sounds of 50 and D-R-E\nEverything's calculated and sound precise\nAnother move another mill', let's get right aight?\nSuccess is my drug of choice, I'm high off life\nFeelin lucky enough to bet it all on the dice\nShorty do what you wanna do, hit the dancefloor\nAnd move how you wanna move, later on\nWe can cruise if you wanna cruise, it's whatever you want\nThe fact is I got more than I flaunt, yeah\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nI do my thang, in the club\nEvery chance I get, I tear it up\nDancefloor jampacked, look\nI got 'em goin goin outta control\nSet it off on yo' left, dog\nSet it off on yo' right, dog\nSet it off\nNigga I said set it off!\n\n[50 Cent]\nSystem thumpin', dancefloor jumpin'\nWe 30 deep in this bitch, we stuntin'\nThat's what you get, you in my hood\nI thought you understood - you know me\nV.I.P., no ID\nBottles of DP, I do it real B-I-G\nBitches break their neck to be where I be\nTake 'em to ecstasy, without ecstasy\nI'm a chef you need the hit I got the recipe\nDoc got the antidote, it's in the drums and the notes\nCan you feel it?

sounds of 50 and D-R-E\nEverything's calculated and sound precise\nAnother move another mill', let's get right aight?\nSuccess is my drug of choice, I'm high off life\nFeelin lucky enough to bet it all on the dice\nShorty do what you wanna do, hit the dancefloor\nAnd move how you wanna move, later on\nWe can cruise if you wanna cruise, it's whatever you want\nThe fact is I got more than I flaunt, yeah\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nI do my thang, in the club\nEvery chance I get, I tear it up\nDancefloor jampacked, look\nI got 'em goin goin outta control\nSet it off on yo' left, dog\nSet it off on

something\n\n[Chorus]\nNigga that watch is nice, that's what you bought for me?\nThat chain is nice, that's what you bought for me?\nThem earrings is nice, that's what you bought for me?\nTake that shit off, move, I'll break you off properly\nI get mine the fast way, the ski mask way\nMake money, make money money money\nNigga if you ask me, this the only way\nTake money, take money money money\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou wanna spray at me go ahead; the last nigga that tried\nGot hit, keeled over, and bled 'til he died\nYour little sister calling you stupid, reason why?\nHer and your momma in the living room now hogtied\nI came up with two new ways to get rich, I can't wait\nGot a brand new SIG and that old .38\nI be scheming to put a little bread on my plate\nWatching dread serve skunk through a hole in the gate\nI stick a nigga for his shine, sell him back the next day\nYou thought I really wanted your pussy? Bitch please\nThis is stash house, jackpot, there go them keys\nMy black G-Unit hoodie just reek with marijuana\nCocaine coming out my pores in the sauna\nI'm serious, man, I'm so sincere\nThis the flow right here that fucked up Jeffrey's career\nMake money, take money, yeah nigga, YEAH!\n\n[Chorus]\nNigga that watch is nice, that's what you bought for me?\nThat chain is nice, that's what you bought for me?\nThem earrings is nice, that's what you bought for me?\nTake that shit off, move, I'll break you off properly\nI get mine the fast way, the ski mask way\nMake money, make money money money\nNigga if you ask me, this the only way\nTake money, take money money money\n\n[Verse 2]\nWho's that peeping in my window - WOW, the Feds on me now\nThey know when I'm sleeping, they know when I'm wake\nI know they got my phone tapped, I'm screaming fuck Jake\nI'm trying to stay out them pens, so I switched states\nBad News, VA - now that sounds great\nI see niggas with that ice on, rims shined up\nThis town's one big pussy, waiting to get fucked\nI holla at AI peoples to get gats\nThey charge me 500 apiece for two MACs\nThen I'm back doing me, I'm back out on a spree\nCatch me a nigga slipping out, pumping that D\nGet me a little crew I'll have 'em pumping for me\nThe more product I take the more paper we see\nChange my name in NY, they don't know where I be\nYeah, a nigga doing dirt, but a nigga low key\n\n[Chorus]\nNigga that watch is nice, that's what you bought for me?\nThat chain is nice, that's what you bought for me?\nThem earrings is nice, that's what you bought for me?\nTake that shit off, move, I'll break you off properly\nI get mine the fast way, the ski mask way\nMake money, make money money money\nNigga if you ask me, this the only way\nTake money, take money money money"}}, {"title": "The Funeral", "album": "Animal Ambition: An Untamed Desire To Win", "year": "2014-02-21", "lyrics": "[Produced by Jake One]\n\n[Intro]\nBoy you forgot my style\n\n[Verse 1]\nFlowers, a funeral service, a kid's in the coffin\nIt sound so familiar, don't it happen so often?\nThe shoot-out shit happens, the sister read the eulogy\nCouldn't help but think ''nigga better you than me''\n.38 ain't got no safety, that bullet got no name on it\nBut it's hard to miss when that thing got a beam on it\nFirst shot, pop off, everybody popping shots\nThe glass at the store front, we forgot God was watching\nRun, run, hit the gate, D's yelling ''drop it''\nNiggas getting jammed up, better that than a jammed up\nHis momma said a few words to her, he was innocent\nShe might have heard he did some shit, but never saw no benefits\nSo in her eyes, he's mommy's little baby\nBut he was outside talking to niggas crazy\nIn a room full of people came to pay their respect\nI just came in to get a close look at nigga to check\nThat nigga dead as a doorknob, stiff as a nail\nAnd my man, tomorrow he gon' get out of jail\nROR, trust me nigga I know the law\nRelease on your own recognizance, that bullshit I'm on it\nThat's his first taste, I mean his first case\nGot knocked with the strap, but not the one that clapped\nThis nigga here we still got that, yeah\nFirst law in my hood is show no fear\nHim and love was closer than we thought, that nigga in here crying\nOh shit, in the store, he probably passed him the iron\nThese some grimy ass niggas, full breed vultures\nTrying to come up, still eating around roaches\nCookie Crisp, Captain Crunch, breakfast of the champions\nLucky charms, stay armed, and niggas won't clap you then\nWe watch the side bitch talking like she his main bitch\nHis wifey just sat there, preachers weren't saying shit\nRight jab, left hook, hand full of weave\nThis type shit a nigga got to see to believe\nThese bitches acting up in here\nPolice they don't fucking care\nHomicides snooping around of them, we all with the shit\nCousin back from college saying he gon' get who did this shit\nHe a ball player nigga, nigga better play ball\nYou play with the wrong niggas we gon' get to letting off\nI done seen enough, feel like it's time for me to split\nHit the parking lot, chill where the weed is lit\nTwist the cap, pour out a little liquor\nAll the theatrics, you know, like that was my nigga\nWe all can't win, some of us got to lose\nEnvision a lil' dog barking at a pack of wolves\nCause that's what happened, yeah yeah, that's what happened\nHe just went on and on till niggas started attacking\nActing like he was the only motherfucker packing\n\n[Outro x2]\n50 bars of pleasure, 50 bars of pain\nWhen I'm dead and I'm gone niggas will remember the name\nIt's 50", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e38c9fce2a42f96648eb8787c9618ebe.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "50 Cent", "raw":

a jammed up\nHis momma said a few words to her, he was innocent\nShe might have heard he did some shit, but never saw no benefits\nSo in her eyes, he's mommy's little baby\nBut he was outside talking to niggas crazy\nIn a room full of people came to pay their respect\nI just came in to get a close look at nigga to check\nThat nigga dead as a doorknob, stiff as a nail\nAnd my man, tomorrow he gon' get out of jail\nROR, trust me nigga I know the law\nRelease on your own recognizance, that bullshit I'm on it\nThat's his first taste, I mean his first case\nGot knocked with the strap, but not the one that clapped\nThis nigga here we still got that, yeah\nFirst law in my hood is show no fear\nHim and love was closer than we thought, that nigga in here crying\nOh shit, in the store, he probably passed him the iron\nThese some grimy ass niggas, full breed vultures\nTrying to come up, still eating around roaches\nCookie Crisp, Captain Crunch, breakfast of the champions\nLucky charms, stay armed, and niggas won't clap you then\nWe watch the side bitch talking like she his main bitch\nHis wifey just sat there, preachers weren't saying shit\nRight jab, left hook, hand full of weave\nThis type shit a nigga got to see to believe\nThese bitches acting up in here\nPolice they don't fucking care\nHomicides snooping around of them, we all with the shit\nCousin back from college saying he gon' get who did this shit\nHe a ball player nigga, nigga better play ball\nYou play with the wrong niggas we gon' get to letting off\nI done seen enough, feel like it's time for me to split\nHit the parking lot, chill where the weed is lit\nTwist the cap, pour out a little liquor\nAll the theatrics, you know, like that was my nigga\nWe all can't win, some of us got to lose\nEnvision a lil' dog barking at a pack of wolves\nCause that's what happened, yeah yeah, that's what happened\nHe just went on and on till niggas started attacking\nActing like he was the only motherfucker packing\n\n[Outro x2]\n50 bars of pleasure, 50 bars of pain\nWhen I'm dead and I'm gone niggas will remember the name\nIt's 50"}}, {"title": "Fuck You", "album": "Guess Who's Back", "year":

to this\nJust lay back and cruise\n\n[Verse 1]\nHere's a taste of my life, it's bitter and sweet\nI pour my heart out to the sounds of the drums and the beat\nI put my life on the line when I'm out on the street\nPut my Teflon on, and roll with my heat\nI keep my circle nice and small, I don't fuck with these clown niggas\nIn the race for the cheese I run laps around niggas\nSoon as I step on stage, the crowd applauds\nSoon as my sneaker went in stores, Reebok stock soared\nI ain't gotta say I'm a boss, niggas could tell\nThe East coast crib the size of a small hotel\nThe shit journalists write about me leave me confused\nHave me feelin' like the heavyweight champ when he lose\nI read somewhere, I'm homophobic, shit\nGo through the hood, there's mad niggas on my dick\nNow we can get hostile, or we can do this smooth\nTNT around, I can still make blow move\n\n[Chorus]\nThis is what you call rider music\nAll the gangsters are ridin' to it (c'mon, let's roll)\nI can show you how we do it\nWhen we ride to that rider music, let's go (let's go)\nThis is what you call rider music\nAll the gangsters are ridin' to it (c'mon, let's roll)\nI can show you how we do it\nWhen we ride to that rider music, let's go\n\n[Verse 2]\nLast year I woke up with good luck, damn it feels good\nOn the low, I done fucked like half of Hollywood\nHad yo favorite actress, from yo favorite shows\nIn my favorite position, you know how it goes\nAnd my Bentley bumpin' Prince shit, this is When Doves Cry\nThis is what it sounds like when hollow-tip slugs fly\nHomie this is somethin' you can ride and smoke to\nStay on point, cause niggas will ride and smoke you\nJealousy's for women, but some niggas is bitch made\nThey make you wanna run across they head with a switchblade\nThey point the finger at me, sayin I'm bugged\nMy flow's crack, you listen, your fuckin' brain's on drugs\nLook ice drippin' on my neck, hands grippin' on a TEC\nFool trippin' threw a set, you can get yo ass wet\nCards messin' up my deck, screws loose show respect\nYou try to come at me kid yo ass better come correct\n\n[Chorus]\nThis is what you call rider music\nAll the gangsters are ridin' to it (c'mon, let's roll)\nI can show you how we do it\nWhen we ride to that rider music, let's go (let's go)\nThis is what you call rider music\nAll the gangsters are ridin' to it (c'mon, let's roll)\nI can show you how we do it\nWhen we ride to that rider music, let's go\n\n[Verse 3]\nMy mama gave birth to a winner, I gotta win\nPray the Lord forgive me for my sins (uh-huh), I'm still thuggin'\nCruisin', rims gleamin' like the stones on my wrist\nZonin', guess this is how it feels to be rich\nHomie, you hustlin' backwards if you chasin' a bitch\nStupid, chase the paper they come with the shit\nI'm fallin', in love with success\nEntrepreneur, connoisseur, I maneuver the best\nRollin', Ruger on my lap, rubber grip on the handle\nStunner have your homies burnin', rest in peace candles\nAs wise men speak I listen and learn\nA man dies, a baby's born, my nigga the world turns\nRappers I make 'em sick, when I say I'm the shit\nThey mistake my confidence for arrogance, they hate on the kid\nIn '99, I had a vision and made a decision\nBein' broke is against my religion\nNow I'm caked up - what?\n\n[Chorus]\nThis is what you call rider music\nAll the gangsters are ridin' to it (c'mon, let's roll)\nI can show you how we do it\nWhen we ride to that rider music, let's go (let's go)\nThis is what you call rider music\nAll the gangsters are ridin' to it (c'mon, let's roll)\nI can show you how we do it\nWhen we ride to that rider music, let's go\nThis is what you call rider music\nAll the gangsters are ridin' to it (c'mon, let's roll)\nI can show you how we do it\nWhen we ride to that rider music, let's go (let's go)\nThis is what you call rider music\nAll the gangsters are ridin' to it (c'mon, let's roll)\nI can show you how we do it\nWhen we ride to that rider music, let's go",

"lyrics": "[Intro]\nYeah\nYeah we can ride to this\nJust lay back and cruise\n\n[Verse 1]\nHere's a taste of my life, it's bitter and sweet\nI pour my heart out to the sounds of the drums and the beat\nI put my life on the line when I'm out on the street\nPut my Teflon on, and roll with my heat\nI keep my circle nice and small, I don't fuck with these clown niggas\nIn the race for the cheese I run laps around niggas\nSoon as I step on stage, the crowd applauds\nSoon as my sneaker went in stores, Reebok stock soared\nI ain't gotta say I'm a boss, niggas could tell\nThe East coast crib the size of a small hotel\nThe shit journalists write about me leave me confused\nHave me feelin' like the heavyweight champ when he lose\nI read somewhere, I'm homophobic, shit\nGo through the hood, there's mad niggas on my dick\nNow we can get hostile, or we can do this smooth\nTNT around, I can still make blow move\n\n[Chorus]\nThis is what you call rider music\nAll the gangsters are ridin' to it (c'mon, let's roll)\nI can show you how we do it\nWhen we ride to that rider music, let's go (let's go)\nThis is what you call rider music\nAll the gangsters are ridin' to it (c'mon, let's roll)\nI can show you how we do it\nWhen we ride to that rider music, let's go\n\n[Verse 2]\nLast year I woke up with good luck, damn it feels good\nOn the low, I done fucked like half of Hollywood\nHad yo favorite actress, from yo favorite shows\nIn my favorite position, you know how it goes\nAnd my Bentley bumpin' Prince shit, this is When Doves Cry\nThis is what it sounds like when hollow-tip slugs fly\nHomie this is somethin' you can ride and smoke to\nStay on point, cause niggas will ride and smoke you\nJealousy's for women, but some niggas is bitch made\nThey make you wanna run across they head with a switchblade\nThey point the finger at me, sayin I'm bugged\nMy flow's crack, you listen, your fuckin' brain's on drugs\nLook ice drippin' on my neck, hands grippin' on a TEC\nFool trippin' threw a set, you can get yo ass wet\nCards messin' up my deck, screws loose show respect\nYou try to come at me kid yo ass better come correct\n\n[Chorus]\nThis is what you call rider music\nAll the gangsters are ridin' to it (c'mon, let's roll)\nI can show you how we do it\nWhen we ride to that rider music, let's go (let's go)\nThis is what you call rider music\nAll the gangsters are ridin' to it (c'mon, let's roll)\nI can show you how we do it\nWhen we ride to that rider music, let's go\n\n[Verse 3]\nMy mama gave birth to a winner, I gotta win\nPray the Lord forgive me for my sins (uh-huh), I'm still thuggin'\nCruisin', rims gleamin' like the stones on my wrist\nZonin', guess this is how it feels to be rich\nHomie, you hustlin' backwards if you chasin' a bitch\nStupid, chase the paper they come with the shit\nI'm fallin', in love with success\nEntrepreneur, connoisseur, I maneuver the best\nRollin', Ruger on my lap, rubber grip on the handle\nStunner have your homies burnin', rest in peace candles\nAs wise men speak I listen and learn\nA man dies, a baby's born, my nigga the world turns\nRappers I make 'em sick, when I say I'm the shit\nThey mistake my confidence for arrogance, they hate on the kid\nIn '99, I had a vision and made a decision\nBein' broke is against my religion\nNow I'm caked up - what?\n\n[Chorus]\nThis is what you call rider music\nAll the gangsters are ridin' to it (c'mon, let's roll)\nI can show you how we do it\nWhen we ride to that rider music, let's go (let's go)\nThis is what you call rider music\nAll the gangsters are ridin' to it (c'mon, let's roll)\nI can show you how we do it\nWhen we ride to that rider music, let's go\nThis is what you call rider music\nAll the gangsters are ridin' to it (c'mon, let's roll)\nI can show

Kid]]\n{*gunshot*}\n{*gunshot*}\n(One)\n(One, two)\n[Non-stop]\n(Yo, check me out right here yo)\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nYo\nYo, we can't stay alive forever\nSo if shit hit the fan, then we might as well die together\nI'm high as ever, more hoes and more cheddar\nG-Unit move around with them pounds and Berettas\nYeah faggot, if I want it, I'm gon' have it\nRegardless if it's handed to me, or I got to grab it\nDon't make a ass out of yourself trying to stop me\nI'm cocky, rap's Rocky, nigga you sloppy\nYou know that I'm, eight levels above you nigga\nI'll club you nigga, I never heard of you nigga\nUgly nigga, I'm the wrong one to provoke\nYou ratting on niggas is only going to leave you smoked\nSo the only thing left now, is toasts for these cowards\nI got no friends; fuck most of these cowards\nThey pop shit; 'till we start approaching these cowards\nWhile we lay around dollars; they lay around flowers\n\n[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]\nI got a industry gangstress, that argues, and steams the reefer\nAnd flip when I call her bitch, like she Queen Latifah\nNow all the vehicles is long enough to stash the street sweeper\nThis shit can get uglier than the Master P sneaker\nI'm sliding through the raucous, with Prada on the chuckers\nSo the spring break hoes home from college want to fuck us\nI ain't here to drop knowledge on you suckers\nI sic Rottweilers on you fuckers, cops following to cuff us\nTop dollars to discuss this, whole lot of zeros\nWhen it come to paper, I blow the soul out a hero\nI'mma break before I lay in the floor buried, besides\nEvery rapper ain't a star, and every plaid ain't Burberry\nYou can't tame Lloyd, we're smoking by the big screen\nChanging the channel, looks like I'm playing the Game Boy\nI know the watch bothering your vision\nBut reach, and I put a dot on your head\nLike it's part of your religion\nWhy party with a pigeon? I'm blowing a ten\nBecause Bush handing out flyers, for a party in the prison\nI'm in the Gucci vest, with the green and red straps\nI'm the last rapper to scare niggas since Craig Mack\nNow every morning's a fast start\nBut it ain't a problem getting dressed\nBecause my closet got more aisles than Pathmark\nRun when we starting a raid\nOr leave with twelve shells in your mouth, like a carton of eggs\nI'm a young pimp, pardon my age\nI don't got long hair, but if I did she'd be parting my braids\nNiggas find out what club they at, take them with us\nAnd run trains on them, like a subway map\nYour advance is a grey Acura; see these record labels\nGot most artists getting fucked like the gay rapper\nI go to college on the tour\nI'm goin down in history nigga, next to Wallace and Shakur\nKeep your ammo clean, Tech's polished in the drawer\nCamera's by the hampers that monitor the floor\nBy now, you probably heard of me, fresh out of surgery\nFlashy as a fuck, you going to have to murder me\nBurglary, I'm leaving with your Nikes burgundy\nWhite T: burgundy, you match now, back down\nNiggas love to hate you, but love you when you disappear\nCatch me on a boat, with weed smoke and fishing gear\nHeavy when I tote, C-notes from different years\nBezzy and the rope, remotes and lifting chairs\nYou ain't rich, but we glad to snatch ya\nI send cars to your crib like I'm a cab dispatcher\nYou better off with the stupid guys, lookin for a coupe to drive\nYou ain't gettin' nuttin', but you french fries supersized\nIt's a damn shame y'all still local\nI'm in a million dollar studio laying my vocals, nigga\n\n[Outro: 50 Cent]\nYou still in the projects nigga, you ain't going nowhere\nYou going to be there for the rest of your motherfucking life\nAnd your mama saying: I'm supposed to tell you something, to encourage you\nSomething positive, alright:\nWell, I ain't going to lie to you motherfucker;\nYou ain't going nowhere\nGet yourself a beer, and get on the fucking curb {*gunshot*}\nFucking dirtbag {*gunshot*}"}}, {"title": "Twisted", "album": "Animal Ambition: An Untamed Desire To Win", "year": "2014-05-20", "lyrics": "[Intro: Mr. Probz (50 Cent)]\nHere's a little info you should know (it's 50)\nYou don't know what you're in for\nWhat you're in for (c'mon)\n\n[Chorus: Mr. Probz (50 Cent)]\nWe get the party rockin', bottles poppin'\nTonight we gon' turn up 'til we (yeah) twisted, yeah\n(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)\nSystem thumpin', the club is jumpin'\nTonight we gon' turn up 'til we twisted, yeah\n(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah)\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nLet's toast to success and take it a little higher\nMay tomorrow bring you everything your heart desires\nLet your driving ambition offer you new visions\nMay your gut-instinct help you make good decisions\nThis is more than Champagne, this is more than just a glass\nThis is a symbol of accomplishment we rarely ever had (ha ha!)\nLet's enjoy tonight like tonight's our last\nWe can focus on the future and reflect on the past (WOOO!)\nWe done came so far, I mean, look where we are\nIf they don't call us by name they call us entrepreneurs\nFrom the block to the board room, the hood to the high life\nSkyscraper paper, baby, life in the limelight\nWant the best of the best, the top of the top\nI mean the baddest bitches, you know, the cream of the crop\nWe gotta hustle and have it, we better than average (uh)\nMore like the elite, my nigga, we gotta eat, c'mon\n\n[Chorus: Mr. Probz (50 Cent)]\nWe get the party rockin', bottles poppin'\nTonight we gon' turn up 'til we (turn up) twisted, yeah\n(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)\nSystem thumpin', the club is jumpin'\nTonight we gon' turn up 'til we (c'mon, c'mon) twisted, yeah\n(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah)\n\n[Verse 2: 50 Cent]\nWhat was once a strike against us has become an advantage\n'Cause we grind when we at it like we stone-cold addicts\nThat mastermind, the mental is oh so essential (uh)\nProduct of the environment (uh), they ain't been what we've been through (yeah)\nI'm fond of the phrase \"If there's a will, there's a way\"\n'Cause we come from the parts where only killers could play\nSouthside (Southside), it's alright\nGhetto's my Alma Mater huh?

party rockin', bottles poppin'\nTonight we gon' turn up 'til we (yeah) twisted, yeah\n(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)\nSystem thumpin', the club is jumpin'\nTonight we gon' turn up 'til we twisted, yeah\n(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah)\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nLet's toast to success and take it a little higher\nMay tomorrow bring you everything your heart desires\nLet your driving ambition offer you new visions\nMay your gut-instinct help you make good decisions\nThis is more than Champagne, this is more than just a glass\nThis is a symbol of accomplishment we rarely ever had (ha ha!)\nLet's enjoy tonight like tonight's our last\nWe can focus on the future and reflect on the past (WOOO!)\nWe done came so far, I mean, look where we are\nIf they don't call us by name they call us entrepreneurs\nFrom the block to the board room, the hood to the high life\nSkyscraper paper, baby, life in the limelight\nWant the best of the best, the top of the top\nI mean the baddest bitches, you know, the cream of the crop\nWe gotta hustle and have it, we better than average (uh)\nMore like the elite, my nigga, we gotta eat, c'mon\n\n[Chorus: Mr. Probz (50 Cent)]\nWe get the party rockin', bottles poppin'\nTonight we gon' turn up 'til we (turn up) twisted, yeah\n(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)\nSystem thumpin', the club is jumpin'\nTonight we gon' turn up 'til we (c'mon, c'mon) twisted, yeah\n(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah)\n\n[Verse 2: 50 Cent]\nWhat was once a strike against us has become an advantage\n'Cause we grind when we at it like we stone-cold addicts\nThat mastermind, the mental is oh so essential (uh)\nProduct of the environment (uh), they ain't been what we've been through (yeah)\nI'm fond of the phrase \"If there's a will, there's a way\"\n'Cause we come from the parts where only killers could play\nSouthside (Southside), it's alright\nGhetto's my Alma Mater huh? It's alright (WOOO!)\nWe could keep the party jumpin' like this all night\nThe bottles, just keep 'em comin', baby, let's get right\nLet's get it on, play a little Marvin\nIt\u2019s gettin' hot in here, homie, this could be a problem\nKeni Burke style, let's keep rising to the top (uh)\nLet's do it, do it big and let a fuckin' hater watch, oh yeah\nThis is perfect, this a moment to remember\nAs we proceed on our money getting agenda, c'mon\n\n[Chorus: Mr. Probz (50 Cent)]\nWe get the party rockin', bottles poppin'\nTonight we gon' turn up 'til we (turn up) twisted, yeah\n(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)\nSystem thumpin', the club is jumpin'\nTonight we gon' turn up 'til we twisted, yeah\n(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah)"}}, {"title": "Chase the Paper", "album": "Animal Ambition: An Untamed Desire

up\nLittle homie loading a semi up\nCatch 'em all after the club, tell 'em the ante up\nAnyway, each and every day, I'm looking for a better way\nYou owe me, you better pay\nGhost, let the beretta spray\nHood want uncut dope and some better yay\nI ain't chasing pussy, never have\nHustle hard, take a break, run and get some head and ass\nStill a rider, still rolling, still need a mask\nStill

steel, that's how I'm owning\nYou chase the hoes, I chase the paper\nYou chase the hoes, I chase the paper\nYou chase the hoes, I chase the paper\nYou're a sucker for love, nigga, I'm money making\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nI'm still a baller, I'm still balling\nThat's five times I ain't picked up, your bitch still calling\nI'm super ghetto, I'm still with the shit\nStill pass the steel to my nigga, hit a lick\nWe still mobbin', niggas still starvin'\nWe still deal after deal, shit is no problem\nHe still love her, she ain't shit\nGet her a pair of Louboutins, she suck a dick\nHe's still a real niggas, still will kill\nTold the still bitch don't squeal or get your cap peeled\nThe Mac filled, black talons, hollow tips\nCopper-tops, get your ass popped, watch a body drop\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nYou chase the hoes, I chase the paper\nYou chase the hoes, I chase the paper\nI'm still a rider, I'm still rolling\nA nigga still hold the steel, that's how I'm owning\nYou chase the hoes, I chase the paper\nYou chase the hoes, I chase the paper\nYou chase the hoes, I chase the paper\nYou're a sucker for love, nigga, I'm money making\n\n[Verse 2: Kidd Kidd]\nI'm clean as a motherfucker, still getting my hands dirty\nBitches they wanna fuck, grab a glass, you looking thirsty\nSee I'm a gangsta, you soft as R&B singers\nI'm at a war with the banger, in the club with the shanker\nMask on, lone ranger, scope on the K, long ranger\nRather be alive and rich than die and be famous\nLive my life in the fast lane, I crash into anything\nI ain't here to entertain when I let them bullets sing\nRims on, Rida Gang, slap the fuck out of you, nigga\nTrying to pull out your pistol when you know that you're lame\nYou chasing these bitches instead of chasing your paper\nNiggas taking your bitches while they taking your paper\nI'm gone\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nYou chase the hoes, I chase the paper\nYou chase the hoes, I chase the paper\nI'm still a rider, I'm still rolling\nA nigga still hold the steel, that's how I'm owning\nYou chase the hoes, I chase the paper\nYou chase the hoes, I chase the paper\nYou chase the hoes, I chase the paper\nYou're a sucker for love, nigga, I'm money making\n\n[Verse 3: Prodigy]\nShe on my leg like a little kid\nShe hump my leg like a horny bitch\nPitbull in a skirt, yeah, I'm a magnet\nNah, I ain't running after no broad, she stuck on my dick\nI'm a different breed, blame it on my genes\nMoney in my jeans, pockets turn her eyes green\nShe's seeing dollar signs, I'm seeing reasons why\nNever had to stress no pussy, I'm one of a kind\nPretty nigga with a gorgeous gun\nYou die a beautiful death, pull a stunt, look\nThere ain't a bitch more dime than me\nThe thirst is real, she knocking over drinks to get next to me\nWhile you..\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nYou chase the hoes, I chase the paper\nYou chase the hoes, I chase the paper\nI'm still a rider, I'm still rolling\nA nigga still hold the steel, that's how I'm owning\nYou chase the hoes, I chase the paper\nYou chase the hoes, I chase the paper\nYou chase the hoes, I chase the paper\nYou're a sucker for love, nigga, I'm money making\n\n[Verse 4: Styles P]\nGhetto niggas still'll pick a penny up\nYou outside chasing them hoes throwing your Henny up\nLittle homie loading a semi up\nCatch 'em all after the club, tell 'em the ante up\nAnyway, each and every day, I'm looking for a better way\nYou owe me, you better pay\nGhost, let the beretta spray\nHood want uncut dope and some better yay\nI ain't chasing pussy, never have\nHustle hard, take a break, run and get some head and ass\nStill a rider, still rolling, still need a mask\nStill popping, still slinging, still need the cash\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nYou chase the hoes, I chase the paper\nYou chase the hoes, I chase the paper\nI'm still a rider, I'm still rolling\nA nigga still hold the steel, that's how I'm owning\nYou chase the hoes, I chase the paper\nYou chase the hoes, I chase the paper\nYou chase the

hard\nWhen I come through they like \"Oh my God!\"\n(THAT NIGGA CLEAN!)\n\n[Chorus]\nFrom the beginning It Was Written I suppose\nI break a whole on the 36 oz - and move it\nI'm a hustler, baby (can you dig it?)\nI'm a hustler, baby (say what?)\nMy mind on the money, I ain't tripping on the hoes\nI blow a whole lot of paper on clothes, but dig it\nI'm a hustler, baby (can you dig it?)\nI'm a hustler, baby\n\n[Verse 1]\nYeah, I come through, I had the hoes like ''who he?''\nSeats in the old school Louie\nShoes and the belt buckle Louie\nWe don't need more details now, do we?\nLet 'em sag, my swag is True Religion\nYou gon' need Cartier frames to see my vision\nIt smells like cream mixed with weed, this is classy and hood\nDrama llama time, nigga, what's good?\nDomino's, muh'fucker, it's time to collect\nStack paper like I'm trying to fix the national debt (wooo!)\nI'm just doing what I wanna do, I trip through your set\nThis is 50 on that Muammar Gaddafi shit\n\n[Chorus]\nFrom the beginning It Was Written I suppose\nI break a whole on the 36 oz - and move it\nI'm a hustler, baby (can you dig it?)\nI'm a hustler, baby (say what?)\nMy mind on the money, I ain't tripping on the hoes\nI blow a whole lot of paper on clothes, but dig it\nI'm a hustler, baby (can you dig it?)\nI'm a hustler, baby\n\n[Verse 2]\nGet on my level, bitch, I'm careful who I kick it with\nWe talk market and distribution and politics (woo!)\nGot a chip on my shoulder, chip off the whole block\nI sell the chip of a whole rock, 10 dollars a pop\nI'm a magnet, the bitch can't help but watch me\nSocks, drawers, undershirt, Versace, Versace, Versace\nDesigner threads in every form of fashion (uh huh)\nI express myself so the question I'm askin' (aaoow!)\nIs this flip or the next flip tailor 50 shit?\nWe ain't promised tomorrow, nigga, go on and get the shit (yeah)\nThat skull and bones, that Alexander McQueen thing\nIn case you ain't notice it's a Queens thing (wooooo!)\n\n[Chorus]\nFrom the beginning It Was Written I suppose\nI break a whole on the 36 oz - and move it\nI'm a hustler, baby (can you dig it?)\nI'm a hustler, baby (say what?)\nMy mind on the money, I ain't tripping on the hoes\nI blow a whole lot of paper on clothes, but dig it\nI'm a hustler, baby (can you dig it?)\nI'm a hustler, baby\n\n[Outro]\nOHHH! It's cold out here\nIt's my kind of weather, I'm cold blooded\nIt's 50\nWhen I come through you see me\nIn the Suburbans that's bulletproof\nBomb proof, leather six, whatever\nWhen I go hard I go hard\nWhen I don't want you to see me I switch it up\nI'm in that black on black Porsche Panamera\nIn the back like ''ooh wee''\nWe rolling\nI hustle, man, it's what I do, man\nWait, niggas gon' try and tell me how to do this?"}}, {"title": "The Good Die Young", "album": "Power of the Dollar", "year": null, "lyrics": "[Intro]\nYo, you know what I want?

I want the beat to drop right now\nNiggas be thinkin' I'm crazy right? Yeah, you are crazy\nI ain't crazy - you are crazy - at least I don't think I'm crazy\nI think my shit is hot, I think I'm hot  you hot, but you crazy\nWhy they wanna? I don't know\n\n[Verse 1]\nIt's the money that makes shit get ugly\nIt's the money that makes these hoes love me\nIt's the money that makes niggas wanna slug me\nMan, I thought the money would make it all lovely\nYo, I actually write what I do and see\nThe felonies from day to day make me say what I say\nWhen I die my art will be worth as much as Picasso's\nDon't cry for me, smile for me\nAnd if you see them niggas who wet me wile' for me\nRemember the good times, the chips we stacked, the clips we packed\nAnd all the bricks we cooked from coke to crack\nLet my tombstone read \"I Tried\" and from the start\nEverything I wrote was from my heart\nSo it\u2019s always gon' be number one on my chart\nI get sensitive with my shit, don't fuck with my art\nSometimes it sounds like I'm playing, but I'm sayin'\nThis shit is real, it ain't a game\n\n[Hook]\nThey say the good die young\nI guess these grimy niggas live a long time\nSit in fancy whips, sip champagne and shine\nKeep your eyes on yours while I keep my eyes on mine\nThey say the good die young\nI guess these grimy niggas live a long time\nSit in fancy whips, sip champagne and shine\nKeep your eyes on yours while I keep my eyes on mine\n\n\n[Verse 2]\nFirst it happened to Stretch then to Pac and Big\nI'm convinced it can happen to anybody, kid\nSo I get vest up when I get dressed up\nIn the hood it's messed up, niggas running 'round shooting shit up\nIf it's Dom that you drinking fill up my cup\nIf you gossiping about me shut the fuck up\nWhy do niggas act like they hard when they know they butt?\nWhen getting robbed ain't a good time to press ya luck\nDuke listen, if you move I'mma hurt you\nYou'll get your turn to shine later, patience is a virtue\nRight now what you need to do is give me the cash\nForget about your boss being mad, just save ya ass\nBe a good boy now, go and get your stash\nI seen you throw it next to the garbage can like it was trash\nAlright, run along before I shoot ya ass\nI hate to do this to you, but I really need this cash\n\n[Hook]\nThey say the good die young\nI guess these grimy niggas live a long time\nSit in fancy whips, sip champagne and shine\nKeep your eyes on yours while I keep my eyes on mine\n\n[Verse 3]\nI know we all gonna go, but I'd hate to go fast\nThen again I don't think it'd be fun to stick around and go last\nMan listen, if you really really like this shit\nNigga, call Steve Stoute and I'll write ya shit\nCall him now before I drop for real cause after I drop\nI'mma be chargin' ya'll niggas like forty a pop\nTo each his own: me? I'd get it while it was cheap\nTypical mentality, I know, I'm straight from the street\n1999's the year of the predator, I'm killing to eat\nNiggas'll treat you like a egg, when you come to cop you get beat\nGive me your dough, oh, you wore your jewels? What a treat\nYou're a generous guy, take 'em off or die\nMan, we hurting 'round here, ain't nobody slinging pies\nLook around, ain't nobody 'round here fly\nWhy you 'round here with this shit anyway? Huh? You high?\nSee, you done made the wrong move, kiss your ass goodbye\n\n[Hook]\nThey say the good die young\nI guess these grimy niggas live a long time\nSit in fancy whips, sip champagne and shine\nKeep your eyes on yours while I keep my eyes on mine"}}, {"title": "Animal Ambition", "album": "Animal Ambition: An Untamed Desire To Win", "year": "2014-05-30", "lyrics": "[Produced by Swiff

People either try to emulate him in some way, or they go in a different direction because they didn't like what he did. But whatever you think of him, he definitely developed his own style: He didn't sound like anyone who came before him.\n\nMy favorite 2Pac album is The Don Killuminati. It was recorded after he was shot and spent time in prison. It was like a doctor told him he was going to die, and he was trying to get it all down on paper. That's something the average rapper just could not do: build an entire album around that concept, and stay in that negative space. Everybody knows that they're going to die. But after you're in a life-threatening situation, you think about it a little more.\n\n2Pac's aggressive records are my favorite. \"Hail Mary\" is just perfect: \"Picture paragraphs unloaded/Wise words being quoted.\" Most artists now just aren't smart enough to write that, or honest enough to write a line like, \"I ain't a killer but don't push me.\" These days rappers will just tell you, \"I'll kill you.\"\n\n2Pac was like a camera. It's incredible how much he wrote \u2014 how much he documented. To me, 'Pac was more of a poet than a rapper. You can always tell when you're hearing 2Pac verse. He wrote those lyrics without any music. Notorious B.I.G. was more melody-driven \u2014 I'm sure he wrote his shit without a pen, and over the music \u2014 but 'Pac was just hashing out his life.

The music was all that mattered. That East Coast/West Coast feud was just personal beef. Now that he's not here, he's bigger than ever. I can still listen to two or three 2Pac CDs straight. Sometimes I put on 2Pac's best songs, followed by Biggie's best songs. Then I get ready to go into my next project.\n\nLaurence Fishburne told me once that he didn't like 2Pac. He told me it was because 2Pac was so much smarter than everyone around him. He said he didn't like the way 2Pac behaved because he knew that 2Pac knew better. I understood what he meant.

"lyrics": "[Produced by Tha Bizness]\n\n[Intro: 50 Cent]\nYeah... ladies and gentlemen\nI'd like to thank y'all for comin' out tonight\nIt's my third album, third tour, third time's a charm\n\n[Intro: Robin Thicke]\nGirl when I go, where we go, I wanna take you 'round the globe with me\nI got dough,  plenty baby you can blow with me\nAnd baby I know that money ain't everything\nBut it's fo' sho' (fo' sho, fo' sho')\nAnd ain't for nothin when you fuck, with, me\nNow when I go\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nFollow my lead\nBaby I can be all you need, if you follow my lead\nFollow my lead, I'll hold you down, put your trust in me\nBaby, follow my lead (follow my lead)\nFollow my lead, I think God made you for me\nFollow my lead - follow my lead\nI'm the one girl in time you'll see\nIf you follow my lead\n\n[Verse 1]\nDon't listen to the rumors, they say 50 fucking crazy\n50 don't know how to treat a lady, they wrong\nI like you a lot, I don't wanna hurt you\nBut I call a square a square and a circle a circle\nSo if you act like a bitch, I'll call you a bitch\nThen hang up, probably call you right back and shit\nAnd have to say, \"baby I apologize\"\nCross my fingers, God forgive me for telling lies\nLike Janet Jackson said, I miss you much\nI really wanna feel your touch, and smell your scent\nBaby, I can pass the day watching you model lingerie\nI wanna spend the night tonight, shorty, if it's okay\nYou can be my Beyonce, I'll be your Jay\nHa ha - I got a great sense of humor\nFirst I make you smile then I woo you, you know I wanna do ya\nOr do ya?\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nAfter seven hours, New York to London, you're wonderin'\nWhat's gon' be the next stop - I told you\nI'm a don, you gon' know I'm a don\nAfter you shop 'til your feet hurting in Milan\nNow take a picture, these are moments you can cherish\nThey say the scenery was made for lovers out in Paris\nAsk your fan about me, they say 50 we love him\nWithout them there's no me, so I love them\nMan they're the reason I exist, the reason I insist\nI'm never less than the best, I'm perfection I guess\nAs my niggas are stressed, I pass the test\nEvery time I drop I'm burning hot\nSo I don't care if she loves me or loves me not\nLong as I enjoy the time that we spend\nI ain't looking for commitment, we can fuck and be friends\nMatter fact, we can do it right in back of my Benz\nI get it done with speed\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "Flight 187", "album": "Before I Self Destruct", "year": "2009-11-09", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nFrom the day you're born 'til the day you die\nIf you're one of the poor ones you just gotta work hard\n\n[Hook]\nOne-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven\nDeparture from the hood, destination hell or heaven\nOne-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven\nDeparture from the hood, destination hell or heaven\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\n\n[Verse 1]\nThey putting pressure on me, son, now they want me to snap\nEnd up like X and Whitney in my mansion smoking crack\nI'm paranoid, I'm feeling like niggas is trying to get me\nForget the kids, I'm shaving off my fucking head like Britney\nMan, Dre won't mix my records, now I need to talk to Jimmy\nI'm falling back in my old ways, I'm riding with the semi\nWho's calling me? It's Chris, he's on the other line with Diddy\nBut I don't wanna talk right now, my day is going shitty\nWhy's Jay rocking that Urkel look, man, isn't he from Marcy?\nThey say he's growin dreads and now he's talking like a Yardie\nMan, everything is changing, I don't understand a thing\nI guess this is that bullshit that all the money brings\nI'm on flight\n\n[Hook]\nOne-eighty-seven,

rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy baby mama boyfriend like to talk like he can hurt me\nI'm laughing cause she kissed him in his mouth and gave him herpes\nThat just makes him one of 50 niggas wanting to murk me\nNiggas found my truck and burnt it up out there in Jersey\nYou can ask my son, he'll tell you \"my dad's fucking crazy\"\nShe filled his head with shit and now I think he fuckin' hates me\nShady didn't invent me but a star is what he made me\nI'll blow your fuckin' mind out if I told you what he paid me\nHe gave me all the pills he had left, that's why I'm so high\nIt makes me feel so good now that I'm not so scared to die\nI wish a nigga would, I dare a motherfucker try\nYou get at me and miss you kiss your black ass good-bye\nI'm on flight\n\n[Hook]\nOne-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven\nDeparture from the hood, destination hell or heaven\nOne-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven\nDeparture from the hood, destination hell or heaven\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\n\n[Verse 3]\nMy lawyers on retainers every month, I give \u2018em stacks\nIn case they wanna send me up for murder like Max\nMan I wasn't the shooter, I was never on the scene\nSo if they do forensics they'll find out it wasn't me\nThere's no need for a lie detector, I ain't sayin shit\nThe more you talk the higher chances you're doing a bid\nToday I read the paper, it said Tru Life caught a case\nThey said they found a victim with a knife stuck in his face\nI spoke to Michael Vick, I told him I'm happy he home\nYou tell them crackers sorry nigga then you get back on\nWhen dogs are fighting in the hood nobody gives a fuck\nSo you get back and shake it on the field, show them what's up\nI'm on flight\n\n[Hook]\nOne-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven\nDeparture from the hood, destination hell or heaven\nOne-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven\nDeparture from the hood, destination hell or heaven\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider", "image":

ones you just gotta work hard\n\n[Hook]\nOne-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven\nDeparture from the hood, destination hell or heaven\nOne-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven\nDeparture from the hood, destination hell or heaven\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\n\n[Verse 1]\nThey putting pressure on me, son, now they want me to snap\nEnd up like X and Whitney in my mansion smoking crack\nI'm paranoid, I'm feeling like niggas is trying to get me\nForget the kids, I'm shaving off my fucking head like Britney\nMan, Dre won't mix my records, now I need to talk to Jimmy\nI'm falling back in my old ways, I'm riding with the semi\nWho's calling me? It's Chris, he's on the other line with Diddy\nBut I don't wanna talk right now, my day is going shitty\nWhy's Jay rocking that Urkel look, man, isn't he from Marcy?\nThey say he's growin dreads and now he's talking like a Yardie\nMan, everything is changing, I don't understand a thing\nI guess this is that bullshit that all the money brings\nI'm on flight\n\n[Hook]\nOne-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven\nDeparture from the hood, destination hell or heaven\nOne-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven\nDeparture from the hood, destination hell or heaven\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy baby mama boyfriend like to talk like he can hurt me\nI'm laughing cause she kissed him in his mouth and gave him herpes\nThat just makes him one of 50 niggas wanting to murk me\nNiggas found my truck and burnt it up out there in Jersey\nYou can ask my son, he'll tell you \"my dad's fucking crazy\"\nShe filled his head with shit and now I think he fuckin' hates me\nShady didn't invent me but a star is what he made me\nI'll blow your fuckin' mind out if I told you what he paid me\nHe gave me all the pills he had left, that's why I'm so high\nIt makes me feel so good now that I'm not so scared to die\nI wish a nigga would, I dare a motherfucker try\nYou get at me and miss you kiss your black ass good-bye\nI'm on flight\n\n[Hook]\nOne-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven\nDeparture from the hood, destination hell or heaven\nOne-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven\nDeparture from the hood, destination hell or heaven\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\n\n[Verse 3]\nMy lawyers on retainers every month, I give \u2018em stacks\nIn case they wanna send me up for murder like Max\nMan I wasn't the shooter, I was never on the scene\nSo if they do forensics they'll find out it wasn't me\nThere's no need for a lie detector, I ain't sayin shit\nThe more you talk the higher chances you're doing a bid\nToday I read the paper, it said Tru Life caught a case\nThey said they found a victim with a knife stuck in his face\nI spoke to Michael Vick, I told him I'm happy he home\nYou tell them crackers sorry nigga then you get back on\nWhen dogs are fighting in the hood nobody gives a fuck\nSo you get back and shake it on the field, show them what's up\nI'm on flight\n\n[Hook]\nOne-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven\nDeparture from the hood, destination hell or heaven\nOne-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven\nDeparture from the hood, destination hell or heaven\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider"}},

do, I done changed the game\nStill niggas actin' like I don't get down or something\nLike I ain't the next nigga to wear the crown or something\nYou gonna talk about your chips 'til we run in your crib\nAnd you gon' ask dumb questions like, \"Can I live?\"\nLook, If I shoot you, I'm famous\nIf you shoot me, you're brainless, you said it yourself\nI'm slick enough to twist your lines and send them back at you\nSwift enough to snatch the Mac and pop that at you\nTake it personal see if I won't send you to hell\nI've done told Tone and Poke, they better have my bail\nBut if its over a mil, don't put the crib up dun\nCause if fifty get free nigga, fifty gon' run\n\n[Hook]\nIt's best you be a gentleman and you watch what you say\nOr Jesus Christ can't save you, once you go 'gainst the

to play me at the dough no more\nBut when they see me, they say..\n\"Search him, he might have the nine\"\nHe might shoot this motherfucker up like Shyne\"\nIt's been a while since a new nigga came tight like this\nYa man, he aight, but he ain't quite like this\nNiggas is feeling it, the Benz pulling up on the set\nMe jumping out, 30 thou on my neck\nAnd since you said it was nothing to sweat\nYou was outta line so here's what you get\nA verbal ass kicking, Jesus Christ sent me to test ya\nLet's see how see how, he reacts under pressure\nTil Makaveli returns, it's all eyes on me\nTil the feds build a case or find files on me\n\n[Hook]\nIt's best you be a gentleman and you watch what you say\nOr Jesus Christ can't save you, once you go 'gainst the grain\n\n[Outro]\nIt's gangsta,

Ja\nI'm moving on now, I got bigger fish to fry\nSince How to Rob, a lot of niggas been namin' names\nMonkey see monkey do, I done changed the game\nStill niggas actin' like I don't get down or something\nLike I ain't the next nigga to wear the crown or something\nYou gonna talk about your chips 'til we run in your crib\nAnd you gon' ask dumb questions like, \"Can I live?\"\nLook, If I shoot you, I'm famous\nIf you shoot me, you're brainless, you said it yourself\nI'm slick enough to twist your lines and send them back at you\nSwift enough to snatch the Mac and pop that at you\nTake it personal see if I won't send you to hell\nI've done told Tone and Poke, they better have my bail\nBut if its over a mil, don't put the crib up dun\nCause if fifty get free nigga, fifty gon' run\n\n[Hook]\nIt's best you be a gentleman and you watch what you say\nOr Jesus Christ can't save you, once you go 'gainst the grain\n\n[Verse 2]\nLook I'm supposed to be cocky, I ain't a poor no more\nI ain't gotta steal from the corner store no more\nGot my own crib, I ain't sleepin' on the floor no more\nBouncers don't try to play me at the dough no more\nBut when they see me, they say..\n\"Search him, he might have the nine\"\nHe might shoot this motherfucker up like Shyne\"\nIt's been a while since a new nigga came tight like this\nYa man, he aight, but he ain't quite like this\nNiggas is feeling it, the Benz pulling up on the set\nMe jumping out, 30 thou on my neck\nAnd since you said it was nothing to sweat\nYou was outta line so here's what you get\nA verbal ass kicking, Jesus Christ sent me to test ya\nLet's see how see how, he reacts under pressure\nTil Makaveli returns, it's all eyes on me\nTil the feds build a case or find files on me\n\n[Hook]\nIt's best you be a gentleman and you watch what you say\nOr Jesus Christ can't save you, once you go 'gainst the grain\n\n[Outro]\nIt's gangsta, 2000 shit\nY'all know what you need to do, get together\nMake a \"We Are the World\" record, faggot ass niggas"}}, {"title": "My Toy Soldier", "album": "The Massacre", "year": "2005-03-03", "lyrics": "[50 Cent]\nYou ready?
