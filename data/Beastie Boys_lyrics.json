worth your while\nGot numbers beyond what you can dial\nMaybe it's because I'm so versatile\nStyle, profile\n\n[Verse 2: Ad-Rock]\nI said it always brings me back when I hear, \"ooh child\"\nFrom The Hudson River out to the Nile\nI run the marathon 'til the very last mile\n\n[Verse 3: MCA]\nWell, if you battle me, I will revile\nPeople always saying my style is wild\nYou've got gall, you've got guile (guile)\nTo step to me, I\u2019m a rapophile\n\n[Verse 4: Mike D]\nIf you wanna battle, you're in denial\nComing from Uranus to check my style\nGo ahead; put my rhymes on trial\nCast you off into exile\n\n[Hook:]\nIntergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic\nIntergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic\n\n[Verse 5: Ad-Rock]\nJazz and AWOL, that's our team\nStep inside the party, disrupt the whole scene\nWhen it comes to beats, well, I'm a fiend\nI like my sugar with coffee and cream\n\n[Verse 6: MCA]\nWell, I gotta keep it going, keep it going full steam\nToo sweet to be sour; too nice to be mean\nWell, on the tough guy style, I'm not too keen\nTrying to change the world, I will plot and scheme\n\n[Verse 7: Mike D]\nMario C likes to keep it clean (clean)\nGoin' to shine like a sunbeam\nKeep on rapping, cause that's my dream\nGot an A from Moe Dee for sticking to themes\n\n[Verse 8: Ad-Rock]\nNow when it comes to envy, ya'll is green\nJealous of the rhyme and the rhyme routine ('tine)\nAnother dimension, new galaxy\nIntergalactic planetary\n\n[Hook:]\nIntergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic\nIntergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic\nIntergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic\nIntergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic\n\n[Verse 9: MCA]\nWe're from the family tree of old school hip-hop\nKick off your shoes and relax your socks\nThe rhymes will spread just like a pox\n'Cause the music is live, like an electric shock\n\n[Verse 10: Mike D]\nI am known to do the wop (wop)\nAlso known for the Flintstone Flop\nTammy D getting biz on the crop (crop)\nBeat-see Boys known to let the beat\n\"MMM, D-r-r-rop!\"\nDo it\n\n[Verse 11: Ad-Rock]\nNow when I wrote graffiti, my name was Slop\nIf my rap's soup, my beats is stock\nStep from the table when I start to chop\nI'm the lumberjack, DJ Adrock\n\n[Verse 12: MCA]\nIf you try to knock me, you'll get mocked\nI'll stir fry you in my wok\nYour knees'll start shaking and your fingers pop\nLike a pinch on the neck from Mr. Spock\n\n[Hook:]\nIntergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic\nIntergalactic planetary, planetary

your button\nBut, yo, I'm out and I'm gone\nI'll tell you now, I keep it on and on\n\nCause what you see, you might not get\nAnd we can bet, so don't you get souped yet\nScheming on a thing, that's a mirage\nI'm trying to tell you now, it's sabotage\n\nWhhhhhyyyyyy\n(Our backs are now against the wall)\n\nListen all y'all, it's a sabotage\nListen all y'all, it's a sabotage\nListen all y'all, it's a sabotage\nListen all y'all, it's a sabotage\n\nI can't stand it, I know you planned it\nI'm-a set it straight, this Watergate\nBut I can't stand rockin' when I'm in this place\nBecause I feel disgrace because you're all in my face\nBut make no mistakes and switch up my channel\nI'm Buddy Rich when I fly off the handle\nWhat could it be -- it's a mirage\nYou're scheming on a thing, that's

why\n\n[Verse 2: Mike D]\nSo tell me who are you dissing; maybe I'm missing\nThe reason that you're smiling or wyling, so listen\nIn my head, I just want to take 'em down\nImagination set loose and I'm gonna shake 'em down\n\n[Verse 3: MCA]\nLet it flow like a mud-slide\nWhen I get on, I like to ride and glide\nI've got depth of perception in my text, y'all\nI get props at my mention cause I

"[Intro: Ad Rock]\nTo Mario C\u2014you can't front on that\n\n[Verse 1: Ad Rock]\nWell just plug me in just like I was Eddie Harris\nYou're eating crazy cheese like you would think I'm from Paris\nYou know I get fly, you think I get high\nYou know that I'm gone and I'm-a tell you all why\n\n[Verse 2: Mike D]\nSo tell me who are you dissing; maybe I'm missing\nThe reason that you're smiling or

"[Produced by Rick Rubin and Beastie Boys]\n\n[Verse 1: Ad-Rock, MCA, (Mike D)]\nNow here's a little story I've got to tell\nAbout three bad brothers you know so well\nIt started way back in history\nWith Ad-Rock, MCA, (and me) Mike D\nBeen had a little horsey named Paul Revere\nJust me and my horsey and a quart of beer\nRiding across the land, kicking up sand\nSheriff's posse on my tail 'cause I'm in demand\nOne lonely Beastie I be\nAll by myself without nobody\nThe sun is beating down on my baseball hat\nThe air is getting hot, the beer is getting flat\nLooking for a girl, I ran into a guy\nHis name was MCA, I said howdy, he said hi\n\n[Verse 2: Ad-Rock, MCA]\nHe told a little story that sounded well rehearsed\nFour days on the run and that he's dying of thirst\nThe brew was in my hand and he was on my tip\nHis voice was hoarse, his throat was dry, he asked me for a sip\nHe said, \"Can I get some?\" \u2013 I said, \"You can't get none!\"\nHad a chance to run but he pulled out his shotgun\nQuick on the draw, I thought I'd be dead\nHe put the gun to my head, and this is what he said\nNow my name is MCA, I've got a license to kill\nI think you know what time it is, it's time to get ill\nNow what do we have here, an outlaw and his beer?\nI run this land, you understand? I made myself clear?\nWe stepped into the wind, he had a gun, I had a grin\nYou think this story's over, but it's ready to begin\n\n[Verse 3: Ad-Rock, MCA, (Mike D)]\nNow I got the gun, you got the brew\nYou got two choices of what you can do\nIt's not a tough decision as you can see\nI can blow you away or you can ride with me\nI said, I'll ride with you if you can get me to the border\nThe sheriff's after me for what I did to his daughter\nI did it like this, I did it like that\nI did it with a wiffleball bat\nSo I'm on the run, the cop's got my gun\nAnd right about now it's time to have some fun\nThe King Ad-Rock, that is my name\nAnd I know the fly spot where they got the champagne\nWe rode for 6 hours, then we hit the spot\nThe beat was a bumping and the girlies was hot\nThis dude was staring like he knows who we are\nWe took the empty spot next to him at the bar\nMCA said, \"Ayo, you know this kid?\"\nI said I didn't, but I knew he did\nThe kid said, (\"Get ready 'cause this ain't funny\nMy name's Mike D and I'm about to get money\")\nPulled out the jammy, aimed it at the sky\nHe yelled (\"Stick 'em up!\") and let two fly\nHands went up and people hit the floor\nHe wasted two kids that ran for the door\n(\"I'm Mike D and I get respect\nYour cash and your jewelry is what I expect\")\nMCA was with it and he's my ace\nSo I grabbed the piano player and I punched him in the face\nThe piano player's out, the music stopped\nThis boy had beef and he got dropped\n(Mike D grabbed the money) MCA snatched the gold\nI grabbed two girlies and a beer that's cold"}}, {"title": "No Sleep Till Brooklyn", "album": "Licensed to Ill", "year": "1986-11-15", "lyrics": "[Chorus]\nNo sleep till\nBrooklyn\n\n[Verse 1: Ad-Rock, Mike D & MCA]\nFoot on the pedal, never ever false metal\nEngine running hotter than a boiling kettle\nMy job's ain't a job, it's a damn good time\nCity to city, I'm running my rhymes\nOn location, touring around the nation\nBeastie Boys always on vacation\nItchy trigger finger but a stable turntable\nI do what I do best because I'm illing and able\nAin't no faking, your money I'm taking\nGoing coast to coast watching all the girlies shaking\nWhile you're at the job working nine-to-five\nThe Beastie Boys at the Garden cold kicking it live\n\n[Chorus]\nNo sleep till\nAnother plane, another train\nAnother bottle in the brain\nAnother girl, another fight\nAnother drive all night\n\n[Verse 2: Mike D, MCA & Ad Rock]\nOur manager's crazy, he always smokes dust\nHe's got his own room at the back of the bus\nTour around the world, you rock around the clock\nPlane to hotel, girls on the jock\nWe're trashing hotels like it's going out of style\nGetting paid along the way 'cause it's worth your while\nFour on the floor, Ad-Rock's out the door\nMCA's in the back 'cause he's sleeping with a whore\nWe got a safe in the trunk with money in a stack\nWith dice in the front and Brooklyn's in the back\nWhite boys got more rhymes\n\n[Chorus]\nNo sleep till\nNo sleep till Brooklyn\nNo sleep till Brooklyn\n\n[Ad-Lib: Ad Rock]\nAin't seen the light since we started this band\nSo, MCA, get on the mic, my man!\n\n[Verse 3: MCA, Mike D & Ad Rock]\nBorn and bred Brooklyn USA\nThey call me Adam Yauch but I'm MCA\nLike a lemon to a lime, a lime to a lemon\nI sip the def ale with all the fly women\nGot limos, arena, and TV shows\nAutograph pictures and classy hoes\nStep off, Holmes, get out of my way!\nTaxing little girlies from here to L.A.\nWaking up before I get to sleep\n'Cause I'll be rocking this party eight days a week\n\n[Chorus]\nNo sleep till\nNo sleep till Brooklyn\nNo sleep till Brooklyn\nNo (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (Brooklyn)\nNo (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (yeah)\n\n[Outro]\nNo (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (Brooklyn)\nNo (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (Brooklyn)\nNo (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (Brooklyn)\nNo (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (Brooklyn)\nNo (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (Brooklyn)\nNo (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (Brooklyn)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/123cab2d194394b11efb406b19403095.600x603x1.jpg", "artist": "Beastie Boys", "raw": {"annotation_count": 19, "api_path": "/songs/9411", "apple_music_id": "5805819", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/9411/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "\u201cNSTB\u201d is a classic Beastie Boys cut from Licensed to Ill, and the LP\u2019s sixth single, released 3.1.1987.  The narrative highlights the Boys' experiences while out on tour, parodying glam and metal rockers from then and eras past. The track was co-produced by Beastie Boys, engineered by Steve Ett, and mastered by Howie Weinberg. Slayer\u2019s Kerry King played lead guitar.\n\nSamples include:\n\n\nAC/DC\u2019s \u201cTNT\u201d from the album, High Voltage (1976).\n\n\n\nThe music video for \u201cNo Sleep till Brooklyn\u201d was co-directed by Ric Menello (RIP) and Adam Dubin, the duo responsible for directing the preceding single\u2019s video \u201cFight for Your Right (To Party).\u201d  Dubin was interviewed for an MTV piece on the \u201913 VMAs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of a take off on No Sleep \u2018til Hammersmith, which is a classic Mot\u00f6rhead  album, which is why there\u2019s so much heavy metal in the song\u2026 It\u2019s not a spoof, but it\u2019s sort of poking fun at heavy metal.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo Sleep\u201d was performed in 76 known concerts.\n\n\n1st Known Performance: 12.26.1986 \u2014

The narrative highlights the Boys' experiences while out on tour, parodying glam and metal rockers from then and eras past. The track was co-produced by Beastie Boys, engineered by Steve Ett, and mastered by Howie Weinberg. Slayer\u2019s Kerry King played lead guitar.\n\nSamples include:\n\n\nAC/DC\u2019s \u201cTNT\u201d from the album, High Voltage (1976).\n\n\n\nThe music video for \u201cNo Sleep till Brooklyn\u201d was co-directed by Ric Menello (RIP) and Adam Dubin, the duo responsible for directing the preceding single\u2019s video \u201cFight for Your Right (To Party).\u201d  Dubin was interviewed for an MTV piece on the \u201913 VMAs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of a take off on No Sleep \u2018til Hammersmith, which is a classic Mot\u00f6rhead  album, which is why there\u2019s so much heavy metal in the song\u2026 It\u2019s not a spoof, but it\u2019s sort of poking fun at heavy metal.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo Sleep\u201d was performed in 76 known concerts.\n\n\n1st Known Performance: 12.26.1986 \u2014 The Ritz, New York, US\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqon7AxYkZ0\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cv8ScmV4K4\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfbeSi6uqM\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLZMz7R7bI\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBPxX4dRspA\n\nLast Known Performance: 6.12.2009 \u2014 Great Stage Park, Manchester, TN, US\n\n\n\n\nAnd here\u2019s Jay-Z\u2019s tribute from All Points West \u2014 Liberty State Park: 7.31.2009

"[Chorus]\nNo sleep till\nBrooklyn\n\n[Verse 1: Ad-Rock, Mike D & MCA]\nFoot on the pedal, never ever false metal\nEngine running hotter than a boiling kettle\nMy job's ain't a job, it's a damn good time\nCity to city, I'm running my rhymes\nOn location, touring around the nation\nBeastie Boys always on vacation\nItchy trigger finger but a stable turntable\nI do what I do best because I'm illing and able\nAin't no faking, your money I'm taking\nGoing coast to coast watching all the girlies shaking\nWhile you're at the job working nine-to-five\nThe Beastie Boys at the Garden cold kicking it live\n\n[Chorus]\nNo sleep till\nAnother plane, another train\nAnother bottle in the brain\nAnother girl, another fight\nAnother drive all night\n\n[Verse 2: Mike D, MCA & Ad Rock]\nOur manager's crazy, he always smokes dust\nHe's got his own room at the back of the bus\nTour around the world, you rock around the clock\nPlane to hotel, girls on the jock\nWe're trashing hotels like it's going out of style\nGetting paid along the way 'cause it's worth your while\nFour on the floor, Ad-Rock's out the door\nMCA's in the back 'cause he's sleeping with a whore\nWe got a safe in the trunk with money in a stack\nWith dice in the front and Brooklyn's in the back\nWhite boys got more rhymes\n\n[Chorus]\nNo sleep till\nNo sleep till Brooklyn\nNo sleep till Brooklyn\n\n[Ad-Lib: Ad Rock]\nAin't seen the light since we started this band\nSo, MCA, get on the mic, my man!\n\n[Verse 3: MCA, Mike D & Ad Rock]\nBorn and bred Brooklyn USA\nThey call me Adam Yauch but I'm MCA\nLike a lemon to a lime, a lime to a lemon\nI sip the def ale with all the fly women\nGot limos, arena, and TV shows\nAutograph pictures and classy hoes\nStep off, Holmes, get out of my way!\nTaxing little girlies from here to L.A.\nWaking up before I get to sleep\n'Cause I'll be rocking this party eight days a week\n\n[Chorus]\nNo sleep till\nNo sleep till Brooklyn\nNo sleep till Brooklyn\nNo (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (Brooklyn)\nNo (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (yeah)\n\n[Outro]\nNo (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (Brooklyn)\nNo (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (Brooklyn)\nNo (no) sleep (sleep)

many - married to none\nAnd in case you're unaware I carry a gun (word)\nStepped into the party - the place was overpacked\nSaw the kid that dissed my homey and shot him in the back\nMan, I had to get a beeper cause my phone is tapped\nYou better keep your mouth shut cause I'm fully strapped\nI got money in the bank - I can still get high\nThat's why your girlfriend thinks that I'm so fly\nI've got money and juice - twin sisters in my bed\nTheir father had envy so I shot him in the head\n\nIf I played guitar I'd be Jimmy Page\nThe girlies I like are underage (check it)\nGirls with boyfriends are the kind I like\nI'll steal your honey like I stole your bike\nMy father - he's jealous cause I'm making that green (what up?)\nI've got a list of girlies' numbers from the places I've been\n\nThere it is\nKick it\n\nYou wanna know why - because I'm\u2026\nOctober 31st - that is my date of birth\nI got to the party, you know what I did?

"And on the cool check in\nCenter stage on the mic\nAnd we're puttin' it on wax\nIt's the new style\n\nFour and three and two and one (What up!)\nAnd when I'm on the mic - the suckers run (Word!)\nDown with Ad-Rock and Mike D. and you ain't\nAnd I got more juice than Picasso got paint\nGot rhymes that are rough and rhymes that are slick\nI'm not surprised you're on my dick(Mike D!)\n\nB-E-A-S-T-I-E, what up Mike D\nAh yeah, that's me\nI got franks and pork and beans\nAlways bust the new routines\nI get it - I got it, I know it's good\nThe rhymes I write - you wish you would\n\nI'm never in training - my voice is not straining\nPeople always biting and I'm sick of complaining\nSo I went into the locker room during classes\nWent into your locker and I smashed your glasses\nYou're from Secaucus - I'm from Manhattan\nYou're jealous of me because your girlfriend is cattin'\n\n(\"There it is\")\nKick it\n\nFather to many - married to none\nAnd in case you're unaware I carry a gun (word)\nStepped into the party - the place was overpacked\nSaw the kid that dissed my homey and shot him in the back\nMan, I had to get a beeper cause my phone is tapped\nYou better keep your mouth shut cause I'm fully strapped\nI got money in the bank - I can still get high\nThat's why your girlfriend thinks that I'm so fly\nI've got money and juice - twin sisters in my bed\nTheir father had envy so I shot him in the head\n\nIf I played guitar I'd be Jimmy Page\nThe girlies I like are underage (check it)\nGirls with boyfriends are the kind I like\nI'll steal your honey like I stole your bike\nMy father - he's jealous cause I'm making that green (what up?)\nI've got a list of girlies' numbers from the places I've been\n\nThere it is\nKick it\n\nYou wanna know why - because I'm\u2026\nOctober 31st - that is my date of birth\nI got to the party, you know what I did? The Smurf\nTaxing all females from coast to coast\nAnd when I get my fill, I'm chilly most\nWe ragtag girlies back at the hotel\nAnd then we all switch places when I ring the bell\nI chill at White Castle cause it's the best\nBut I'm fly at Fatburger when (when he's) I'm way out west\nK-I-N-G-A-D whammy\nAll the fly ladies, they're on my jammy\nWent to the prom - wore the fly blue rental\nGot six girlies in my Lincoln Continental\nI met a girl at the party and she started to flirt\nI told her some rhymes and she pulled up her skirt (check it)\nSpent some bank - I got a high powered jumbo\nRolled up a wooly (what did he do?) and I watched Columbo\n\nLet me clear my throat\nKick it over here baby pop\nAnd let all the fly skimmies feel the beat\nMmm... drop\n\nCoolin' on the corner on a hot summer day\nJust me, my posse and MCA\nA lot of beer - a lot of girls - and a lot of cursin'\nTwenty-two automatic on my person\nGot my hand in my pocket and my finger's on the trigger\nMy posse's gettin' big - and my posse's gettin' bigger\nSome voices got treble - some voices got bass\nWe got the kind of voices that are in your face\nLike the bun to the burger - like the burger to the bun\nLike the cherry to the apple - to the peach to the plum\nI'm the King of the Ave. - and I'm the king of the block\nWell, I'm MCA - and I'm the King Ad-Rock\nWell, I'm Mike D - I got all the fly juice\nOn the checkin' at the party on the Forty Deuce\nWalking down the block with the fresh fly threads\nBeastie Boys fly the biggest heads\n\nHo, ho, ho, ho, ho...\nHo, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho...\nBrooklyn, ho\nHo, ho, ho, ho, ho..."}}, {"title": "Ch-Check It Out", "album": "To the 5 Boroughs", "year": null, "lyrics": "[Intro]\nOh, what'ch'you...what are you sayin?\n\n[Verse 1: MCA]\nAll you Trekkies and TV addicts\nDon't mean to diss, don't mean to bring static\nAll you Klingons in the fucking house\nGrab your backstreet friend and get loud\nBlowin' doors off hinges\nI'll grab you with the pinchers\nAnd no, I didn't retire\nI'll snatch you up with a needle nose pliers\n\n[Verse 2: Mike D]\nLike Mutual of Omaha\nGot the ill boat you've never seen before\nGlidin' in the glades\nAnd like Lorne Greene, you know I get paid\nLike caprese and with the basil\nNot goofy like Darren or Hazel\nI'm a motherfuckin' Nick at Night\nWith classics rerunning that you know all right\n\n[Verse 3: Ad Rock]\nNow remain calm, no alarm\n'Cause my farm ain't fat\nSo what's up with that?\nI've got friends and family that I respect\nWhen I think I'm too good, they put me in check\nSo believe when I say I'm no better than you\nExcept when I rap, so I guess it ain't true\nLike that, y'all, and you just don't stop\nGuaranteed to make your body rock\n\n[Chorus]\nCheck-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out\nWhat-wha-what-what-what's it all about\nWork-wa-work-work-work-wa-work it out\nLet's turn this muthafucking party out\n\n[Verse 4: Mike D]\nI said, \"Doc, what's the condition?\nI'm a man that's on a mission\"\nHe said, \"Son, you'd better listen\nStuck in your ass is an electrician\"\nLike a scientist\nMmm, when I'm applying this\nMethod of controlling my mind\nLike Einstein and the Rapping Duke combined\n\n[Verse 5: Ad Rock]\nNow, hey, baby bubba, now what's the deal?\nI didn't know you go for that mass appeal\nSome call it salugi, some hot potato\nI stole your mic, but you won't see it later\n'Cause I work magic like a magician\nI add up, the mathematician\nI'm a bank cashier, engineer\nI wear cotton and I don't wear sheer\n\n[Verse 6: MCA]\nShazam and abracadabra\nIn the whip, I'm gonna cruise past ya\nYo, money, don't chump yourself\nPut that shit back on the shelf\nLight rays blazing, you're out of phase, and my crew's amazing\nWe're working on the record, yo, so just stay patient\n\n[Chorus]\nCheck-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out\nWhat-wha-what-what-what's it all about\nWork-wa-work-work-work-wa-work it out\nLet's turn this motherfucking party out\nCheck-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out\nCheck-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out\nCheck-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out\nCheck-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out\n\n[Verse 7: Ad Rock]\nNow, I go by the name of the King Ad-Rock\nI don't wear a cup nor a jock\nI bring the shit that's beyond bizarre\nLike Miss Piggy (Who, moi?)\nI am the one with the clientele\nYou say, \"Ad-Rock, you rock so well\"\nI've got class like pink champale\nMCA, grab the mic before the mic goes stale\n\n[Verse 8: MCA]\nDon't test me, they can't arrest me\nI'll fake right, cross-over and shoot lefty\nYou look upset, yo, calm down\nYou look like Cable Guy dunked off of your crown\nI flow like smoke out a chimney\nYou never been me\nYou wanna rap but what you're making ain't hip-hop, B\n\n[Verse 9: Mike D]\nGet your clothes right out the dryer\nPut Armor All up on your tire\nSport that fresssssh attire\nTonight we goin' out, set the town on fire\nSet the town ablaze\nGonna stun and amaze\nReady to throw a craze\nMake your granny shake her head and say \"those were the days\"\n\n[Chorus]\nNow check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out\nWhat-wha-what-what-what's it all about\nWork-wa-work-work-work-wa-work it out\nLet's turn this motherfucking party out", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2a920a09ca3563c79238e1866367dd36.600x600x1.jpg", "artist": "Beastie Boys", "raw": {"annotation_count": 42, "api_path": "/songs/5772", "apple_music_id": "725839391", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/5772/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "No, for real, check this out.\nThis is track #1 on the To the 5 Boroughs LP, released 6.4.2004.

Trekkies and TV addicts\nDon't mean to diss, don't mean to bring static\nAll you Klingons in the fucking house\nGrab your backstreet friend and get loud\nBlowin' doors off hinges\nI'll grab you with the pinchers\nAnd no, I didn't retire\nI'll snatch you up with a needle nose pliers\n\n[Verse 2: Mike D]\nLike Mutual of Omaha\nGot the ill boat you've never seen before\nGlidin' in the glades\nAnd like Lorne Greene, you know I get paid\nLike caprese and with the basil\nNot goofy like Darren or Hazel\nI'm a motherfuckin' Nick at Night\nWith classics rerunning that you know all right\n\n[Verse 3: Ad Rock]\nNow remain calm, no alarm\n'Cause my farm ain't fat\nSo what's up with that?\nI've got friends and family that I respect\nWhen I think I'm too good, they put me in check\nSo believe when I say I'm no better than you\nExcept when I rap, so I guess it ain't true\nLike that, y'all, and you just don't stop\nGuaranteed to make your body rock\n\n[Chorus]\nCheck-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out\nWhat-wha-what-what-what's it all about\nWork-wa-work-work-work-wa-work it out\nLet's turn this muthafucking party out\n\n[Verse 4: Mike D]\nI said, \"Doc, what's the condition?\nI'm a man that's on a mission\"\nHe said, \"Son, you'd better listen\nStuck in your ass is an electrician\"\nLike a scientist\nMmm, when I'm applying this\nMethod of controlling my mind\nLike Einstein and the Rapping Duke combined\n\n[Verse 5: Ad Rock]\nNow, hey, baby bubba, now what's the deal?\nI didn't know you go for that mass appeal\nSome call it salugi, some hot potato\nI stole your mic, but you won't see it later\n'Cause I work magic like a magician\nI add up, the mathematician\nI'm a bank cashier, engineer\nI wear cotton and I don't wear sheer\n\n[Verse 6: MCA]\nShazam and abracadabra\nIn the whip, I'm gonna cruise past ya\nYo, money, don't chump yourself\nPut that shit back on the shelf\nLight rays blazing, you're out of phase, and my crew's amazing\nWe're working on the record, yo, so just stay patient\n\n[Chorus]\nCheck-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out\nWhat-wha-what-what-what's it all about\nWork-wa-work-work-work-wa-work it out\nLet's turn this motherfucking party out\nCheck-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out\nCheck-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out\nCheck-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out\nCheck-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out\n\n[Verse 7: Ad Rock]\nNow, I go by the name of the King Ad-Rock\nI don't wear a cup nor a jock\nI bring the shit that's beyond bizarre\nLike Miss Piggy (Who, moi?)\nI am the one with the clientele\nYou say, \"Ad-Rock, you rock so well\"\nI've got class like pink champale\nMCA, grab the mic before the mic goes stale\n\n[Verse 8: MCA]\nDon't test me, they can't arrest me\nI'll fake right, cross-over and shoot lefty\nYou look upset, yo, calm down\nYou look like Cable Guy dunked off of your crown\nI flow like smoke out a chimney\nYou never been me\nYou wanna rap but what you're making ain't hip-hop, B\n\n[Verse 9: Mike D]\nGet your clothes right out the dryer\nPut Armor All up on your tire\nSport that fresssssh attire\nTonight we goin' out, set the town on fire\nSet the town ablaze\nGonna stun and amaze\nReady to throw a craze\nMake your granny shake her head and say \"those were the days\"\n\n[Chorus]\nNow check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out\nWhat-wha-what-what-what's it all

come and rock the sure shot\n\n[Verse 1: Mike D]\nI've got the brand new doo-doo, guaranteed like Yoo-hoo\nI'm on like Dr. John, yeah, Mr. Zu Zu\nI'm a newlywed, not a divorcee (yeah)\nAnd everything I do is funky like Lee Dorsey\n\n[Verse 2: Ad-Rock]\nWell it's the taking of the Pelham 1, 2, 3\nIf you want a doody rhyme, then come see me\nI've got the savior faire with the unique rhymin'\nI keep it on and on, it's never quitting time and\n\n[Verse 3: MCA]\nStrictly handheld is the style I go\nNever rock the mic with the pantyhose\nI strap on my ear goggles and I'm ready to go\n\u2018Cause at the boards is the man, they call the Mario\n\n[Verse 4: Mike D]\nYou pull up at the function and you know I Kojak\nTo all the party people that are on my Bozac\nI've got more action than my man, John Woo\nAnd I've got mad hits like I was Rod Carew (yeah)\n\n[Hook: Beastie Boys]\nCause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop\nCause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop\nYou know you can't, you won't, and you don't stop\nAd-Rock, come and rock the sure shot\n\n[Verse 5: Ad-Rock]\nHurra-, Hurra-\nCane will cross fade on your ass and bust your eardrums\nListen everybody cause I'm shifting gears\nI'm fresh like Dougie when I get my specs\nAnd on the microphone, I come correct\n\n[Verse 6: MCA]\nTiming like a clock when I rock the hip-hop\nTop notch is my stock on the soapbox\nI've got more rhymes than I've got gray hairs\nAnd that's a lot because I've got my share (oohh, weee)\n\n[Verse 7: Mike D]\nI've got a hole in my head and there's no one to fix it\nI gotta straighten my thoughts\nI'm thinking too much (yeah) sick shit\nEveryone just takes and takes, takes, takes, takes\nI'll have to step back, I gotta contemplate\n\n[Verse 8: Ad-Rock]\nWell, I'm like Lee Perry, I'm very on\nRock the microphone, and then I'm gone\nI'm like Vaughn Bode, I'm a Cheech Wizard\nNever quittin', so won't you listen\n\n[Hook: Beastie Boys]\nAh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, yes, indeed, it's fun time\nCause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop\nCause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop\nWell, you can't, you won't, and you don't stop\nMCA, come and rock the sure shot\n\n[Verse 9: MCA]\nI want to say a little something that's long overdue\nThe disrespect to women has got to be through\nTo all the mothers and the sisters and the wives and friends\nI want to offer my love and respect to the end\n\n[Verse 10: Mike D]\nWell, you say I'm twenty-something and I should be slacking\nBut I'm working harder than ever and you could call it macking\nSo I'm supposed to sit upon my couch just watching my TV\nI'm still listening to wax, I'm not using the CD\n\n[Verse 11: Ad-Rock]\nWell, I'm that kid in the corner all fucked up and I wanna\nSo I'm gonna (yeah) take a piece of the pie\nWhy not, I'm not quittin'\nThink I'm-a change up my style just to fit in\n\n[Verse 12: MCA]\nI keep my underwear up with a piece of elastic\nI use a bullshit mic that's made out of plastic\nTo send my rhymes out to all the nations\nLike Ma Bell, I got the ill communication\n\n[Hook: Beastie Boys]\nCause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop\nCause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop\nWell, you can't, you won't, and you don't stop\nKeep on and rockin' the sure shot\n\nB-boys, b-girls...\nTick-tock, tick-tick...tock-tock"}}, {"title": "Fight for Your Right", "album": "Licensed

Licensed To Ill.  The record was released on 6.6.1986 by Def Jam Recordings, a division of CBS/Columbia Records, but the single did not drop until 2.22.1987.\n\n\n\n source: musicalos80\n\nThe song was co-written by Beastie Boys, Rick Rubin, and Tom Cushman.  It was engineered by Steve Ett, and mastered by Howie Weinberg.  \u201cFight for Your Right\u201d was a massive crossover hit for the Boys, thanks in part to Mr. Rubin getting Slayer\u2019s Kerry King to play guitar on the track.  Its adorably goofy video, co-directed by Ric Menello (RIP) and Adam Dubin, received massive airplay on MTV.  The majority of the \u201cactors\u201d appearing in the video were friends of the band, many of whom are identified below\u2026\n\n\n\nThe song was written as a satirical, sarcastic jab at \u201cparty anthems\u201d. The group indulged in this image with their tongues firmly in their cheeks, but to their disappointment, the joke was lost on the masses. \u201cFight for Your Right\u201d became a frat house battle cry and the Beastie Boys became synonymous with the lifestyle they were parodying\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\nFight For Your Right was performed in 17 known concerts.\n\n\n1st Known Performance: 12.26.1986 \u2014 The Ritz, New York, US\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ3OBdkHaeYps\n\nLast Known Performance: 8.20.1987 \u2014 Madison Square Garden, New York, NY, US\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsource: 45cat"},

The record was released on 6.6.1986 by Def Jam Recordings, a division of CBS/Columbia Records, but the single did not drop until 2.22.1987.\n\n\n\n source: musicalos80\n\nThe song was co-written by Beastie Boys, Rick Rubin, and Tom Cushman.  It was engineered by Steve Ett, and mastered by Howie Weinberg.  \u201cFight for Your Right\u201d was a massive crossover hit for the Boys, thanks in part to Mr. Rubin getting Slayer\u2019s Kerry King to play guitar on the track.  Its adorably goofy video, co-directed by Ric Menello (RIP) and Adam Dubin, received massive airplay on MTV.  The majority of the \u201cactors\u201d appearing in the video were friends of the band, many of whom are identified below\u2026\n\n\n\nThe song was written as a satirical, sarcastic jab at \u201cparty anthems\u201d. The group indulged in this image with their tongues firmly in their cheeks, but to their disappointment, the joke was lost on the masses. \u201cFight for Your Right\u201d became a frat house battle cry and the Beastie Boys became synonymous with the lifestyle they were parodying\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\nFight For Your Right was performed in 17 known concerts.\n\n\n1st Known Performance: 12.26.1986 \u2014 The Ritz, New York, US\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ3OBdkHaeYps\n\nLast Known Performance: 8.20.1987 \u2014 Madison Square Garden, New York, NY, US\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsource: 45cat"},

party\n\n[Verse 2]\nYour pop caught you smoking, and he said: \"No way!\"\nThat hypocrite smokes two packs a day\nMan, living at home is such a drag\nNow your mom threw away your best porno mag (Busted!)\n\n[Refrain]\nYou gotta fight for your right to party\nYou gotta fight\n\n[Verse 3]\nDon't step out of this house if that's the clothes you're gonna wear\nI'll kick you out of my home if you don't cut that hair\nYour mom busted in and said, \u201cWhat's that noise?\"\nAw, Mom, you're just jealous it's the Beastie Boys\n\n[Refrain]\nYou gotta fight for your right to party\nYou gotta fight

abstract, that freaky nigga\n\n[Ad Rock]\nNow I'm Ad Rock and I shock and I tick and I tock\nAnd I can't stop with the body rock\n\n[Mike D]\nSee, I've got heart like John Starks\nHitting mad sparks\nPass me the mic and I'll be rockin' the whole park\n\n[MCA]\nWell, I'm the M to the C to the A and it's a must\nThe rhymes that we bust on the topic of lust\n\n[Q-Tip]\nAnd my Moms is not

Rock]\nNow I'm Ad Rock and I shock and I tick and I tock\nAnd I can't stop with the body rock\n\n[Mike D]\nSee, I've got heart like John Starks\nHitting mad sparks\nPass me the mic and I'll be rockin' the whole park\n\n[MCA]\nWell, I'm the M to the C to the A and it's a must\nThe rhymes that we bust on the topic of lust\n\n[Q-Tip]\nAnd my Moms is not butt, but fuck it\nLet me get down to the rhythm\nYes, I get funky and I'm shooting all my jism\nLike John Holmes, the X-rated nigga\nListen to the shit cause I am the ill figure\nNobody's getting any bigger than this\n\nGet it together\nGet...\nPhone is ringing, oh my God\nGet it together, see what's happening\n\n[Q-Tip]\nAd Rock's down with the Ione\nListen to the shit cause both of them is bony\nGotta do it like this, like Chachi And Joanie\n\n[Ad Rock]\nCause she's the cheese and I'm the macaroni\nSo why all the fight and why all the fuss?\n'Cause I ain't got no dust\nYeah, you know I'm getting silly\nGot a Grandma Hazel and a Grandma Tilly\n\n[Mike D]\nWell, I'm the Grand Royal prez and I'm also a member\nBorn on the cusp in the month of November\nI do the Patty Duke, in case you don't remember\nWell, I freak a funky beat like the shit was in a blender\n\n[MCA]\nWell, I'm long gone, word is bond\nDon't need a motherfuckin' fool to tell me right from wrong\nI don't think I'm slick nor do I play like I'm hard\nBut I'm-a drive the lane like I was Evan Bernard\n\n[Ad Rock]\nAnd I be working on my game\n\n[Mike D]\nBecause life is taxing\n\n[MCA]\nGotta get it together\n\n[All 3]\nAnd see what's happening\n\nGet it together\nWait a minute, wait a minute\nWait a minute, wait a minute\nGet it together\nWait a minute, wait a minute\nWait a minute, wait a minute\nGet it together\nWait a minute, wait a minute\nS-see what's happening\n\nI go One-Two like my name was Biz Mark\nBut I had to do the shit, just let me embark\nOn the lyric and the noun and the verb\nLet me kick the shit off cause, yo, I'm not the herb\n\n[Mike D]\nWell, it's not the herb but the spice with the flavor to spare\nThe Moog with the funk for your derriere\nWhile we're on that topic, yes, I like to mention\nWhen it comes to bonin' - woo! - I'm representing\n\n[MCA]\nSpacin', zonin', talkin' on the phone and\nMy brain is roamin' and I don't know where it's goin'\nTalking lots of shit, a little tweaking on the weekend (what?)\nI gotta to get him by the reins because I know that I'm freaking (yeah)\n\n[Ad Rock]\nWell, I'm a funky soul and I'm a Scorpio\nAnd when I get my flow I'm Dr. On-the-Go\nSo, Q-Tip, what you on the mic for?\n\n[Q-Tip]\nBecause I had to talk about the times when I rhyme\nAnd when MCs come in my face, I'm like mace\nBecause I back them off with the quills\nCause I tell you, nigga', cause I'll keep you under prills\nResting on Nine-One-One Sixteenth Ave., off the Farmers Boulevard (yeah)\n\n[Ad-Rock]\nWell I'm from Manhattan, MCA's from Brooklyn\nYeah, MCA, your shit be cookin'\n\n[MCA]\nPraying mantis on the court and I can't be beat\nBut, yo, Tip, what's up with the boots on your feet?\n\n[Q-Tip]\nGot the Timbos on the toes and this is how it goes\nOh, one-two, oh my god\nOne-two, oh my god\n\n[Mike D]\nI got some shit\nI've got the kung fu grip behind my green trap kit\nNever, ever, ever smoking crack\n\n[Q-Tip]\nNever, ever, ever fucking wack\nI eat the fuckin' pineapple Now & Laters\nListen to me now, don't listen to me later\nFuck it, cause I know I didn't make it fuckin' rhyme for real\nBut, yo, technically I'm as hard as steel\n\nGonna get it together, watch it\nGonna get it together, Ma Bell\nI'm like Ma Bell, Got the ill communication\nMa Bell, Got the ill communication\nMa Bell, Got the ill communications (Who's that?)\nMa Bell, Got the

asked him, \"Please?\" \u2013 he said, \"You may.\"\nHer pants were tight and that's ok\nIf she would dance, I would DJ\nWe took a walk down to the bay\n\nI hope she'll say\n\"Hey, me and you should hit the hay!\"\nI asked her out, she said \"No way!\"\nI should've probably guessed her gay\nSo I broke North with no delay\nI heard she moved real far away\nThat was two years ago this May\nI seen her just the other day\nJockin' Mike D. to my dismay\n\nGirls \u2013 to do the dishes\nGirls \u2013 to clean up my room\nGirls \u2013 to do the laundry\nGirls \u2013 and in the bathroom\nGirls \u2013

leg down, your right leg up\nTilt your head back, let's finish the cup\nM.C.A. with the bottle, D. rocks the can\nAd-Rock gets nice with Charlie Chan\nWe're offered Mo\u00ebt, we don't mind Chivas\nWherever we go, with bring the Monkey with us\nAd-Rock drinks three, Mike D. is D\nDouble R foots the bill most definitely\nI drink Brass Monkey and I rock well\nI got a Castle in Brooklyn, that's where I dwell\n\n[Hook]\nBrass Monkey- that funky Monkey\nBrass Monkey junkie\nThat funky Monkey\nBrass\n\n[Verse 2]\nBecause\n'Cause I drink it anytime and anyplace\nWhen it's time to get ill - I pour it on my face\nMonkey tastes def when you pour it on ice\nCome on, y'all, it's time to get nice\nCoolin' by the lockers, getting kind of funky\nMe and the crew, we're drinking Brass Monkey\nThis girl walked by, she gave me the eye\nI reached in the locker, grabbed the Spanish Fly\nI put it with the Monkey, mixed it in the cup\nWent over to the girl, \"Yo baby, what's up?\"\nI offered her a sip-sip, the girl she gave me lip-lip\nIt did begin, the stuff wore in and now she's on my tip\n\n[Hook]\nBrass Monkey - that funky Monkey\nBrass Monkey junkie\nThat funky Monkey\nBrass\n\n[Verse 3]\nStep up to the bar, put the girl down\nShe takes a big gulp and slaps it around\nYou take a sip, you can do it, you get right to it\nWe had a case in the place and we went right through it\nYou got a dry Martini, you thinking you're cool\nI'll take your place at the bar, I smack you off your stool\nI'll down a '40 dog in a single gulp\nAnd if you got beef, you'll get beat to a pulp\nMonkey and parties and reelin' and rockin'\nDef-def girls-girls, all y'all jockin'\nThe song and dance keeping you in a trance\nIf you don't buy my record, I got my advance\nI drink

"lyrics": "Now, I rock a house party at the drop of a hat\nI beat a biter down with an aluminum bat\nA lot of people they be Jonesin' just to hear me rock the mic\nThey'll be staring at the radio, staying up all night\nSo like a pimp, I'm pimpin'\nI got a boat to eat shrimp in\nNothing wrong with my leg, I'm just B-boy limpin'\nGot arrested at the Mardi Gras for jumping on a float\nMy man MCA's got a beard like a billy goat\nOoh-ooh is my disco call\nMCA (hu-huh), I'm gettin' rope, y'all\nRoutines I bust, and the rhymes that I write\nAnd I'll be busting routines and rhymes all night\nLike eating burgers or chicken and you'll be picking ya nose, man\nI'm on time, homie, that's how it goes\nYou heard my style, I think you missed the point\nIt's The Joint!\n\nMike D... (Yeah?) With your bad self running things\nWhat's up with your bad breath onion rings\nWell, I'm Mike D, and I'm back from the dead\nChillin' at the beach, down at Club Med\nMake another record 'cause the people they want more of this\nSuckers they be saying they can take out Adam Horovitz\nHurricane, you got clout\nOther DJ's, he'll put your head out\nA puppet on a string, I'm paid to sing or rhyme or do my thing\nI'm in a lava lamp, inside my brain hotel\nI might be freakin or peakin', but I rock well\nThe Patty Duke Show, the Wrench, and then I bust the Tango\nGot more rhymes than Jamaica got Mango\nI got the peg leg at the end of my stump-a\n\nShake your rump-a\n\nA full clout, y'all, a full clout, y'all\nAnd when the mic is in my mouth, I turn it out, y'all\nA full clout\n\n*sound of a bong hit followed by a shotgun noise*\n\nNever been dumped, cause I'm the most mackinest\nNever been jumped, cause I'm known the most packinest\nYeah, we've got beef, chief, we're knocking out teeth, chief\nAnd if you don't believe us, you should question your belief, Keith\nLike Sam the butcher bringing Alice the meat\nLike Fred Flintstone, driving around with bald feet\nShould I have another sip? Nah, skip it\nIn the back of the ride and bust with the whippet\nRope a dope dookies all around the neck\nWho-ha, got them all in check\nRunning from the law, the press, and the parents\nIs your name Michael Diamond? No, mine's Clarence\nFrom downtown, Manhattan, the Village\nMy style is wild, and you know that it still is\nDisco bag schlepping, and you're doing the bump\n\nShake your rump-a", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bcaa525dc53df04903f585df46d5bd5e.600x600x1.jpg", "artist": "Beastie Boys", "raw": {"annotation_count": 29, "api_path": "/songs/9363", "apple_music_id": "724971889", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/9363/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "This is Track 2 on Paul\u2019s Boutique, released 7.25.1989 on Capitol Records.

got a beard like a billy goat\nOoh-ooh is my disco call\nMCA (hu-huh), I'm gettin' rope, y'all\nRoutines I bust, and the rhymes that I write\nAnd I'll be busting routines and rhymes all night\nLike eating burgers or chicken and you'll be picking ya nose, man\nI'm on time, homie, that's how it goes\nYou heard my style, I think you missed the point\nIt's The Joint!\n\nMike D... (Yeah?) With your bad self running things\nWhat's up with your bad breath onion rings\nWell, I'm Mike D, and I'm back from the dead\nChillin' at the beach, down at Club Med\nMake another record 'cause the people they want more of this\nSuckers they be saying they can take out Adam Horovitz\nHurricane, you got clout\nOther DJ's, he'll put your head out\nA puppet on a string, I'm paid to sing or rhyme or do my thing\nI'm in a lava lamp, inside my brain hotel\nI might be freakin or peakin', but I rock well\nThe Patty Duke Show, the Wrench, and then I bust the Tango\nGot more rhymes than Jamaica got Mango\nI got the peg leg at the end of my stump-a\n\nShake your rump-a\n\nA full clout, y'all, a full clout, y'all\nAnd when the mic is in my mouth, I turn it out, y'all\nA full clout\n\n*sound of a bong hit followed by a shotgun noise*\n\nNever been dumped, cause I'm the most mackinest\nNever been jumped, cause I'm known the most packinest\nYeah, we've got beef, chief, we're knocking out teeth, chief\nAnd if you don't believe us, you should question your belief, Keith\nLike Sam the butcher bringing Alice the meat\nLike Fred Flintstone, driving around with bald feet\nShould I have another sip? Nah, skip it\nIn the back of the ride and bust with the whippet\nRope a dope dookies all around the neck\nWho-ha, got them all in check\nRunning from the law, the press, and the parents\nIs your name Michael Diamond? No, mine's Clarence\nFrom downtown, Manhattan, the Village\nMy style is wild, and you know that it still is\nDisco bag schlepping, and you're doing the bump\n\nShake your rump-a"}}, {"title": "The Sounds of Science", "album": "Paul's Boutique", "year": "1989-07-25", "lyrics": "Now here we go dropping science, dropping it all over\nLike bumping around the town like when you're driving a Range Rover\nExpanding the horizon and expanding the parameters\nExpanding the rhymes of sucka MC amateurs\nNaugles, Issac Newton, a scientific EZ\nBen Franklin with the kite, gettin\u2019 ova with the key\nNow rock, shocker the mike of the many times, times the times tables\nRock well to tell, dispel, all of the old fables\nCuz I be dropping the new science and I be kicking the new k-nowledge\nAn emcee to a degree that you can't get in college\nNow the dregs of the Earth and the eggs that I eat\nI've got pegs through my hands and one through my feet\nShea Stadium, the radium, E.M.D. squared\nKicked out of the Palladium, 'dja think that I cared?\nIt's the sounds...of science, the sounds...of science\n\n(Ad Rock)\nRope-a-Dope!\nThe newest in new, \"Right up to your face and diss you\"\nWaxin' and milkin'\nAll of y'all square heads\n\nTime and money for girls covered with honey\nYou lie and aspire to be as cunning\nReelin' and rockin' and rollin' B sized D cup\nOrder the quarter deluxe, why don'tcha wake up\nMy mind is kinda flowing like an oil projector\nHad to get up and get the Jimmy protector\nWent bezerk and worked, and exploded\nShe woke up in the morning and her face was coated\nBuddy you study the man on the mic\nD, do whatcha like\nDrunk as a skunk am I from celebration\nTo peep that freak unique penetration\nWell I figured out who makes the crack it's\nThe suckas with the badges and the blue jackets\nProfessor of science cuz I keep droppin' it\nI smell weak cuz y'all keep poppin' it\nPeople always ask me what's the phenomenon\nYo what's up?

and pulled out an egg\nScoped him with my scopes, he had no hair\nLaunched that shot and he was caught out there\nSaw the convertible driving by\nI loaded up the slingshot, let one fly\nHe went for his to find he didn't have one\nPut him in check, correct, with my egg-gun\nThe egg, a symbol of life\nI go inside your house and bust out your wife\nI pulled out the jammy, he thought it was a joke\nThe trigger, I pulled - his face, the yolk\nReached in his pocket, took all his cash\nLeft my man standing with the egg mustache\nSuckers, they come a dime a dozen\n\"When I say dozen, you know what I'm talkin' about, boy\"\n\nYeah, that's right, I'm the Egg Man, driving around\nKing of the town (yeah)\nAlways got my windows rolled down\nReady to throw\nYou know, I'm the Egg Man\n\nOnce upon a time\nEgg Man\u2026\n\nHumpty Dumpty was a big fat egg\nHe was playing the wall, then he broke his leg\nTossed it out the window, three minutes hot\nHit the Rastaman, he said, (Bloodclot!)\nWhat came first, the chicken or the egg?\nI egged the chicken, and then I ate his leg\nRiding the trains, in between cars\nWhen I pull out the station, You're Gonna Get Yours\nDrive-by eggings, plaguing LA\n\"Yo, you just got my little cousin, ese!\"\nSometimes hard-boiled, sometimes runny (Ray)\nComes from a chicken, not a bunny, dummy\nPeople laugh, it's no joke\nMy name's \"Yauch\" and I'm throwing the yolk\n\"Now they got me in a cell,\" but I don't care\nIt was then that I got caught catching people out there\n\nUp on the roof, in my car, up all night\nI'm going through science like Dolemite\nThe Mack\u2026 Who?\nI'm the Egg Man\u2026 Taxi driver?\nI'm the Egg Man\nEgg Man, Egg Man\n\nWe all dressed in black, we snuck up around the back\nWe began to attack, the eggs did crack on Haze's back\nSam I Am, down with the program\nGreen Eggs and Ham, Yosemite Sam\nCome Halloween, you know I come strapped\nI throw it at a sucker\u2026 \"k-pap\"\nYou made the mistake and judge a man by his race\nYou go through life with egg on your face\nWoke up in the morning, peculiar feeling\nLooked up and saw egg dripping from the ceiling\nThe family, punk rocks, the businessman\nI'll dog everybody with the egg in my hand\nIt's not like the crack that you put in a pipe\nBut crack on your forehead; here's a towel, now wipe\n\nEgg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man\nEgg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man\nEgg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man...\nEgg Man..."}}, {"title": "Rhymin & Stealin", "album": "Licensed to Ill", "year": "1986-11-15",

"[Produced by Rick Rubin and Beastie Boys]\n\nBecause mutiny on the Bounty's what we're all about\nI'm gonna board your ship and turn it on out\nNo soft sucker with a parrot on his shoulder\nCause I'm bad gettin' bolder - cold getting colder\nTerrorizing suckers on the seven seas\nAnd if you've got beef - you'll get capped in the knees\nWe got sixteen men on a dead man's chest\nAnd I shot those suckers and I'll shoot the rest\n\nMost illingest b-boy - I got that feeling\nCause I am most ill and I'm rhymin' and stealin'\n\nSnatching gold chains, nicking pieces of eight\nI got your money and your honey and the fly name plate\nWe got wenches on the benches - and bitties with titties\nHousing all girlies from city to city\nOne for all and all for one\nTaking out emcees with a big shotgun\nAll for one and one for all\nBecause the Beastie Boys have gone AWOL\nFriggin' in the riggin' and cuttin' your throat\nBig biting suckers gettin' thrown in the moat\nWe got maidens and wenches - man, they're on the ace\nAh, Captain Bligh is gonna die when we break his face\n\nMost illingest b-boy, well, I got that feeling\nI am most ill and I'm rhymin' and stealin'\n\nAli Baba and the forty thieves\nAli Baba and the forty thieves\nAli Baba and the forty thieves\nAli Baba and the forty thieves\nAli Baba and the forty thieves\nAli Baba and the forty thieves\nAli Baba and the forty thieves\nAli Baba and the forty thieves\n\nTorching and crakin' and rhymin' and stealin'\nRobbin' and raping - busting two in the ceiling\nI'm wheelin', I'm dealin' - I'm drinking, not thinking\nNever cower, never shower - and I'm always stinking\nYo-ho-ho and a pint of Brass Monkey\nAnd when my girlie shakes her hips, she sure gets funky\nSkirt chasin', free basin' - killin' every village\nWe drink and rob and rhyme and pillage\n\nMost illingest b-boy, well, I got that feeling\nI am most ill and I'm rhymin' and stealin'\n\nI was\u2026\nI've been drinking my rum - a def son of a gun\n*I fought the law* and I cold won\nBlackbeard's weak - Moby Dick's on the chicks\nCause I pull out my jammy and squeeze off six\nMy pistol is loaded - I shot Betty Crocker\nDeliver Colonel Sanders down to Davey Jones' locker\nRhymin' and stealin' in a drunken state\nAnd I'll be rockin' my rhymes all the way to Hell's gate\n\nMost chillinest b-boy\nI am most ill and I'm rhymin' and stealin'\nMost killingest b-boy\nI am most ill and I'm rhymin' and stealin'\nMost dustin' out b-boy\nI tossin' my dust\nMost finkiest b-boy\nI'm doin' that finkin'\nMost rhyminest b-boy\nI'm stretchin' my shade\nMost shootinest b-boy\nI think you're shit\nMost rhyminest b-boy\nI'll steal your shit, homeboy\nMost taxinest b-boy\nI tax you boy\nMost illingest, illingest, illingest,

White Castle\n\nHold it now, hit it\nYo, Leroy!\nIt's my drum, it's my, hold it now, it's my rhyme\n\nAnd now it's me, Adam Yauch, in the place to be\nAll the girls are on me 'cause I'm down with Mike

bruisin', I'm never ever losing\nI'm in my car, I'm going far, and dust is what I'm using\nAround the way is where I'm from\nAnd I'm from Manhattan and I'm not a bum\nBecause you're pud-slapping,

parking meter, all of the time\nIf I run out of ale, it's Thunderbird wine\nMiller drinking, chicken eating, dress so fly\nI got friends in high places that are keeping me high\nGet down with Mike D and it ain't no hassle\nI got the ladies of the eighties from here to White Castle\n\nHold it now, hit it\nYo, Leroy!\nIt's my drum, it's my, hold it now, it's my rhyme\n\nAnd now it's me, Adam Yauch, in the place to be\nAll the girls are on me 'cause I'm down with Mike D\nI'm down with Mike D and it ain't no baloney\nFor real, not phony, O.E. and Rice-a-Roni\nI come out at night 'cause I sleep all day\nWell, I'm the King Ad-Rock and he's MCA\nWell, I'm cruisin', I'm bruisin', I'm never ever losing\nI'm in my car, I'm going far, and dust is what I'm using\nAround the way is where I'm from\nAnd I'm from Manhattan and I'm not a bum\nBecause you're pud-slapping, ball-flapping, got that juice\nMy name's Mike D and I can do that Jerry Lewis\n\nHold it now, hit it\nYo, Leroy!\nYo, that was real def man, try that again, man\nI like that def stuff, boy\n\nHip-hoppin' and body rockin', doin' the do\nBeer drinking, breath stinking, sniffing glue\nBelly fillin', always illin', bustin' caps\nMy name's Mike D and I write my own snaps\nI'm a peep-show seeking on the Forty-Deuce\nI'm a killer at large and I'm on the loose\nPistol packing, Monkey drinking, no money bum\nI come from Brooklyn 'cause that's where I'm from\nCheap-skatin', perpetrating, money-hungry jerk\nEvery day I drink O.E. and I don't go to work\nYou drippy nose knucklehead, you're wet behind the ears\nYou like men and we like beer\n\nHold it now, hit it\nYo, Leroy!\nBust that choco-lotto\nWhat, huh, yo, man, pass that over here, man, alright\n\nKing of the Ave with the Def female\nYou're rhymin' and stealin' with the freshest ale\nKid cooling at the crib watching my TV\nEd Norton - Ted Knight - and Mr. E-D\nPump it up homeboy, just don't stop\nChef Boyardee, cooling on the pot\nI take no slack, 'cause I got the knack\nI'm never dusting out 'cause I tossed that crack\nThe King Ad-Rock \u2014 that is my name\nY'all drinking Moet and we got the champagne\nA quarter droppin', going shoppin', buyin'

"Hey\nHey ladies in the place, I'm callin' out to ya\nThere never was a city kid truer and bluer\nThere's more to me than you'll ever know\nAnd I got more hits than Sadaharu Oh\nTom Thumb, Tom Cushman, or Tom Foolery\nDate women on TV with the help of Chuck Woolery\nWords flowin' out just like the Grand Canyon\nAnd I'm always out lookin' for a female companion\nI threw the lasso around the tallest one and dragged her to the crib\nI took off her moccasins and put on the bib\nWheelin' and dealin' I make a little bit of a stealin'\nI'll bring you back to the place and your dress I'm peelin'\nYour body's on time and your mind is appealin'\nStarin' at the cracks up there upon the ceilin'\nSuch and such will be the bass that I'm throwin'\nI'm talking to a girl, telling her I'm all-knowing\nWell, she's talking to the kid (who? to the kid)\nI'm telling her every lie that you know that I never did\n\nHey ladies, get funky\nAll the ladies in the house\nThe ladies, the ladies\n\nWell, me in the corner with a good-lookin' daughter\nI dropped my drawers and said \"Welcome back Kotter\"\nWe was cuttin' up the rug, she started cuttin' up the carpet\nIn my apartment, I begged her please stop it\nThe gift of gab is the gift that I have\nAnd that girl ain't nothin' but a crab\nEducated\u2026 No, Stupid\u2026 Yep\nAnd when I say stupid, I mean stupid fresh\nI'm not James At 15 or Chachi in charge\nI'm Adam and I'm adamant about livin' large\nWith the white sassoons and the looks that kill\nMakin' love in the back of my Coupe De Ville\nI met a little cutie, she was all hopped up on zootie\nI liked the little cutie, but I kicked her in the booty\nCause I don't kinda go for that messin' around\nYou be listenin' to my records', a number one sound\nStep to the rhythm, step, step to the rhyme\nI've got an open mind so why don't you all get inside\nTune in, turn on, to my tune that's live\nLadies flock like bees to a hive\n\nHey ladies, get funky\nHey, hey, hey, hey, ladies\nGirls, girls\nHey, hey, hey, hey, ladies\nOne more time ain't it funky now\nHey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, ladies\nAin't it funky now\n\nYou know that\nShe's got a gold tooth, you know she's hardcore\nShe'll show you a good time, then she'll show you the door\nBreak up with your girl, it ended in tears\nVincent van Gogh, go and mail that ear\nI call her in the middle of the night when I'm drinkin'\nThe phone booth on the corner is damp and it's stinkin'\nShe said come on over, it was me that she missed\nI threw that trash can through her window cause you know I got dissed\nYour old lady left you and you went insane\nYou blew yourself up in the back of the 6 Train\nWell, take my advice at any price\nA gorilla like your mother is mighty weak, man\nSuckin' down pints 'till I didn't know\nWoke up in the morning at the Won Ton Ho\nCause I announce, I like girls that bounce\nWith the weight that pays about a pound per ounce\nGirls with curls, and big long locks\nAnd beatnik chicks, just wearing their smocks\nWalkin' high and mighty like she's number one\nShe thinks she's the passionate one\n\nHey ladies, get funky\nWhat's that?\nGood god\nGood god, dance\nGood god\nBaby, baby, baby, baby\nAin't it funky, brother?\nHe, ha, ha, ha\nHey, hey, hey, hey, ladies\nHey, hey, ladies", "image":

know\nAnd I got more hits than Sadaharu Oh\nTom Thumb, Tom Cushman, or Tom Foolery\nDate women on TV with the help of Chuck Woolery\nWords flowin' out just like the Grand Canyon\nAnd I'm always out lookin' for a female companion\nI threw the lasso around the tallest one and dragged her to the crib\nI took off her moccasins and put on the bib\nWheelin' and dealin' I make a little bit of a stealin'\nI'll bring you back to the place and your dress I'm peelin'\nYour body's on time and your mind is appealin'\nStarin' at the cracks up there upon the ceilin'\nSuch and such will be the bass that I'm throwin'\nI'm talking to a girl, telling her I'm all-knowing\nWell, she's talking to the kid (who? to the kid)\nI'm telling her every lie that you know that I never did\n\nHey ladies, get funky\nAll the ladies in the house\nThe ladies, the ladies\n\nWell, me in the corner with a good-lookin' daughter\nI dropped my drawers and said \"Welcome back Kotter\"\nWe was cuttin' up the rug, she started cuttin' up the carpet\nIn my apartment, I begged her please stop it\nThe gift of gab is the gift that I have\nAnd that girl ain't nothin' but a crab\nEducated\u2026 No, Stupid\u2026 Yep\nAnd when I say stupid, I mean stupid fresh\nI'm not James At 15 or Chachi in charge\nI'm Adam and I'm adamant about livin' large\nWith the white sassoons and the looks that kill\nMakin' love in the back of my Coupe De Ville\nI met a little cutie, she was all hopped up on zootie\nI liked the little cutie, but I kicked her in the booty\nCause I don't kinda go for that messin' around\nYou be listenin' to my records', a number one sound\nStep to the rhythm, step, step to the rhyme\nI've got an open mind so why don't you all get inside\nTune in, turn on, to my tune that's live\nLadies flock like bees to a hive\n\nHey ladies, get funky\nHey, hey, hey, hey, ladies\nGirls, girls\nHey, hey, hey, hey, ladies\nOne more time ain't it funky now\nHey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, ladies\nAin't it funky now\n\nYou know that\nShe's got a gold tooth, you know she's hardcore\nShe'll show you a good time, then she'll show you the door\nBreak up with your girl, it ended in tears\nVincent van Gogh, go and mail that ear\nI call her in the middle of the night when I'm drinkin'\nThe phone booth on the corner is damp and it's stinkin'\nShe said come on over, it was me that she missed\nI threw that trash can through her window cause you know I got dissed\nYour old lady left you and you went insane\nYou blew yourself up in the back of the 6 Train\nWell, take my advice at any price\nA gorilla like your mother is mighty weak, man\nSuckin' down pints 'till I didn't know\nWoke up in the morning at the Won Ton Ho\nCause I announce, I like girls that bounce\nWith the weight that pays about a pound per ounce\nGirls with curls, and big long locks\nAnd beatnik chicks, just wearing their smocks\nWalkin' high and mighty like she's number one\nShe thinks she's the passionate one\n\nHey ladies, get funky\nWhat's that?\nGood god\nGood god, dance\nGood god\nBaby, baby, baby, baby\nAin't it funky, brother?\nHe, ha, ha, ha\nHey, hey, hey, hey, ladies\nHey, hey, ladies"}}, {"title": "Shadrach",

dirty thoughts for dirty minds we contribute to\nI once was lost but now I'm found\nThe music washes over and you're one with the sound\nWho shall inherit the earth?

on a Tuesday night\nIt's not how you play the game, it's how you win it\nI cheat and steal and sin, and I'm a cynic\nFor those about to rock, we salute you\nThe dirty thoughts for dirty minds we contribute to\nI once was lost but now I'm found\nThe music washes over and you're one with the sound\nWho shall inherit the earth? The meek shall\nI think I'm starting to peak now, Al\nAnd the man upstairs, I hope that he cares\nIf I had a penny for my thoughts, I'd be a millionaire\nWe're just three emcees and we're on the go\nSHADRACH, MESACH, ABEDNEGO\n\nOnly 24 hours in a day, only 12 notes a man can play\nMusic for all, not just one people\nAnd now we're gonna bust with the Putney Swope sequel\nMore Adidas sneakers than a plumber's got pliers\nGot more suits than Jacoby & Meyers\nIf not for my vices, my bugged-out desires\nMy year would be good just like Goodyear's tires\nSo I'm out picking pockets at the Atlantic Antic\nAnd nobody wants to hear you because your rhymes are so frantic\nI mix business with pleasure way too much\nYou know -- wine and women and song and such\nI don't get blue -- I got a mean red streak\nYou don't pay the band, your friends, yo that's weak\nGet even like Steven like pulling a Rambo\nSHADRACH, MESACH, ABEDNEGO\n\nSteal from the rich and I'm out robbing banks\nGive to the poor and I always give thanks\nBecause I've got more stories than J.D.'s got Salinger\nI hold the title and you are the challenger\nI've got money like Charles Dickens\nGot the girlies in the Coupe like the Colonel's got the chickens\nAnd I'm always going out dapper like Harry S. Truman\nI'm madder than Mad's Alfred E. Newman\n(Never gonna let them say that I don't love you)\nMy noggin is hoggin' all kinds of thoughts\nAnd Adam Yoggin is Yauch and he's rockin' of course\nSmoke the holy chalice, got my own religion\nRally round the stage and check the funky dope musicians\nLike Jerry Lee Swaggart or Jerry Lee Falwell\nYou love Mario Andretti cause he always drives his car well\nVicious circle of reality since the day you were born\nAnd we love the hot butter on what? The popcorn\nSippin' on wine and mackin'\nRockin' on the stage with all the hands clappin'\nRide the wave of fate, it don't ride me\n(Being very proud to be an m.c.)\nAnd the man upstairs, I hope that he cares\nIf I had a penny for my thoughts, I'd be a millionaire\nAmps and crossovers under my rear hood\nBecause the bass is bumping from the back of my Fleetwood\n\nThey tell us what to do? Hell, no!\nShadrach, Meshach, Abednego\n\nShadrach, Meshach, Abednego\nShadrach, Meshach, Abednego\nShadrach, Meshach, Abednego\nShadrach, Meshach, Abednego\nShadrach, Meshach, Abednego\nShadrach, Meshach, Abednego\nShadrach, Meshach, Abednego (no)\nShadrach, Meshach, Abednego"}}, {"title": "Make Some Noise", "album": "Hot Sauce Committee Part 2", "year": "2011-04-11", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nYeah, get up\nYeah\nUh\n\n[Verse 1: Ad-Rock, Mike D, MCA]\nYes, here we go again, give you more, nothing lesser\nBack on the mic, it's the anti-depressor\nAd-Rock--no pressure--yes, we need this\nThe best is yet to come and, yes, believe this\nLeggo my Eggo while I flex my ego\nSip on Prosecco, dressed up tuxedo\nSipping coffee, playing Keno in the casino\nWant a lucky number, ask Mike Dino\nI burn the competition like a flamethrower\nMy rhymes, they age like wine as I get older\nI'm getting bolder, competition is wanin'\nI got the ball and I see the lane and\n\n[Chorus]\nWe got a party on the left, a party on the right\nWe gotta party for the motherfucking right to fight\nMake some noise if you're with me\nYou gotta make some noise if you're with me\nCrazy, crazy, crazy\n\n[Verse 2: Ad-Rock, Mike D, MCA]\nArmed insurrection, popular election\nGet paid every year like tax collection\nHear my perfection, rotary connection\nTaking MCs down by lethal rap injection\nI'm like an ornithologist when I get pissed\nYou must have drank a Fizzy-Lifting Drink and you got lifted\nAnd sifted, I'm just riffing\nAnd when I catch MCs, it's time for wing clipping\nI fly like a hawk, or better yet an eagle\nA seagull, I sniff suckers out like a beagle\nMy ego is off and running and gone\nCause I'm about the best and if you fess, well, that's wrong\n\n[Chorus]\nWe got a--\nWe got a party on the left, a party on the right\nWe gotta party for the motherfucking right to fight\nMake some noise if you're with me\nYou gotta make some noise if you're with me\nCrazy, crazy, crazy\nThe break is crazy\nCrazy-crazy\n\n[Verse 3: Ad-Rock, Mike D, MCA]\nPass me the scalpel, I'll make an incision\nI'll cut off the part of your brain that does the bitching\nPut it in formaldehyde and put it on the shelf\nAnd you can show it to your friends and say, \"That's my old self\"\nCan't do me nothing, can't tell me nada\nDon't bug me now because I'm doing the lambada (bada!)\nThe forbidden dance (wha!), here's my chance\nTo make romance in my B-boy stance\nParlay romancing into financing\nOpened up a restaurant with Ted Danson\nThe roaches check in, but they never check out\nI set the record straight, no doubt\n\n[Chorus]\nWe got a--\nWe got a party on the left, a party on the right\nWe gotta party for the motherfucking right to fight\nMake some noise if you're with me\nYou gotta make some noise if you're with me", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/5a32bce6eeb8a95c31f79e834c0f5c57.650x650x1.png", "artist": "Beastie Boys", "raw": {"annotation_count": 24, "api_path": "/songs/49017", "apple_music_id": "715797905", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/49017/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "\u201cMake Some Noise\u201d is Track 1 on Beastie Boys' 8th (full-length) studio album, Hot Sauce Committee Part Two, their first hip-hop album in nearly ten years.

here we go again, give you more, nothing lesser\nBack on the mic, it's the anti-depressor\nAd-Rock--no pressure--yes, we need this\nThe best is yet to come and, yes, believe this\nLeggo my Eggo while I flex my ego\nSip on Prosecco, dressed up tuxedo\nSipping coffee, playing Keno in the casino\nWant a lucky number, ask Mike Dino\nI burn the competition like a flamethrower\nMy rhymes, they age like wine as I get older\nI'm getting bolder, competition is wanin'\nI got the ball and I see the lane and\n\n[Chorus]\nWe got a party on the left, a party on the right\nWe gotta party for the motherfucking right to fight\nMake some noise if you're with me\nYou gotta make some noise if you're with me\nCrazy, crazy, crazy\n\n[Verse 2: Ad-Rock, Mike D, MCA]\nArmed insurrection, popular election\nGet paid every year like tax collection\nHear my perfection, rotary connection\nTaking MCs down by lethal rap injection\nI'm like an ornithologist when I get pissed\nYou must have drank a Fizzy-Lifting Drink and you got lifted\nAnd sifted, I'm just riffing\nAnd when I catch MCs, it's time for wing clipping\nI fly like a hawk, or better yet an eagle\nA seagull, I sniff suckers out like a beagle\nMy ego is off and running and gone\nCause I'm about the best and if you fess, well, that's wrong\n\n[Chorus]\nWe got a--\nWe got a party on the left, a party on the right\nWe gotta party for the motherfucking right to fight\nMake some noise if you're with me\nYou gotta make some noise if you're with me\nCrazy, crazy, crazy\nThe break is crazy\nCrazy-crazy\n\n[Verse 3: Ad-Rock, Mike D, MCA]\nPass me the scalpel, I'll make an incision\nI'll cut off the part of your brain that does the bitching\nPut it in formaldehyde and put it on the shelf\nAnd you can show it to your friends and say, \"That's my old self\"\nCan't do me nothing, can't tell me nada\nDon't bug me now because I'm doing the lambada (bada!)\nThe forbidden dance (wha!), here's my chance\nTo make romance in my B-boy stance\nParlay romancing into financing\nOpened up a restaurant with Ted Danson\nThe roaches check in, but they never check out\nI set the record straight, no doubt\n\n[Chorus]\nWe got a--\nWe got a party on the left, a party on the right\nWe gotta party for the motherfucking right to fight\nMake some noise if you're with me\nYou gotta make some noise if you're with me"}}, {"title": "Professor

to do with those dudes.\"\n\"Wait a minute, I saw your female with 'em, too. What's up with her? I've been hearin' that she been givin' that stuff out to ALL them graffiti guys.\"\n\"Yo, shut the fuck up, Chico, man!\"\n\"I could paint three of those murals for some of that ass.\"\n\n\"Professor, what's another word for 'pirate treasure'?\"\n\"Well, I think it's 'booty'. Booty, booty, that's what it is.\"\n\n[Adrock]\nYes, I got more bounce than the fucking bump\nAnd then you want to know why\nBecause I'm motherfuckin' truckin'\nI'm in the pocket just like Grady Tate\nGot supplies of beats so you don't have to wait\nCause I'm the master blaster, drinking up the shasta\nMy voice sounds sweet cause it has to\nSo light a match to my ass cause I'm blowin' up\nI'd like to thank the people for just showin' up\nBut now I want y'all to move it\nPut your point on the floor and just prove it\nAnd I'm smurfin', not rehearsin', gettin' live, y'all\nA little puffy, so you know what, I'm doin' right\nCause that's the kind of frame of mind I'm in\nI got this feelin' that it's back again\nSo don't touch me, cause I'm electric\nAnd if you touch me, you'll get shocked\n\n[Mike D]\nYou got, you got, you got, you got, you got\nYou've got the boomin' system, but it's sloshing out doo-doo\nYou think it's chocolate milk, but it's watered down Yoo-hoo\nI've been through many times in which I thought I might lose it\nThe only thing that saved me, has always been music\nWe've got our own studio, the Son of the G\nIt's no question, life's been good to me\nCause life ain't nothing but a good groove\nA good mixtape to put you in the right mood\nThis one goes out to my man, the Groove Merchant\nComing through with beats for which I've been searching\nLike two sealed copies, of expansions\nI'm like Tom Vu with yachts and mansions\nThe logo I sport is the face of the monkey\nUnion made, Ben Davis-quality, it's no junk, see?\nMy chrome is shining, just like an icicle\nI ride around town in my low-rider bicyle\n\n[MCA]\nSo many wack emcees, you get the TV bozak\nAin't even gonna call out your names, cause you're so wack\nAnd one big oaf, who's faker than plastic\nA dictionary definition of the word spastic\nYou should have never started something that you couldn't finish\nCause writin' rhymes to me is like Popeye to spinach\nI'm bad ass, move ya' fat ass, cause you're wack, son\nDancing around like you think you're Janet Jackson\nThought you could walk on me to get some ground to walk on\nI'll put the rug out under your ass as I talk on\nI'll take you out like a sniper on a roof\nLike an emcee at the fever in the DJ booth\nWith your headphones strapped, you're rockin' rewind/pause\nTryin' to figure out what you can do to go for yours\nBut like a pencil to a paper, I got more to come\nOne after another, you can all get some\nSo you better take your time, and meditate on your rhyme\nCause your shit'll be stinkin' when I go for mine\nAnd that's right, y'all, don't get uptight, y'all\nYou can't say shit because you're biting what I write, y'all\nAnd that's wrong, y'all, over the long haul\nYou can't cut the mustard when you're fronting it all"}}, {"title": "3-Minute Rule", "album": "Paul's Boutique", "year": "1989-07-25", "lyrics": "[Produced by Beastie Boys & Dust Brothers]\n\n[Mike D]\nI stay up all night, I go to sleep watching Dragnet\nNever sleep alone because Jimmy is the magnet\nI'm so rope, they call me Mr. Roper\nWhen the troubles arise, you know I'm the cool coper\nOn the mic I score, just like the Yankees\nGet over on Miss Crabtree like my main man Spankee\nExcuse me young lady, I don't mean to trouble ya\nBut you're lookin' so fly inside your BMW\nI got lucky, I brought home the kitten\nBefore I got busy, I slipped on the mitten\nCan't get better odds because I'm a sure thing\nProud Mary keeps on turning and rolling like a Ring-Ding\nJump the turnstiles, never pay the toll\nDoo-wah diddy and bust in with the pre-roll\nCustoms jailed me over an herb seed\nDon't rat on your boy over some rat weed\nI'm outta your back door, I'm into another\nYour boyfriend doesn't know about me and your mother\nNot perfect grammar, always perfect timing\nThe Mike stands for money and the D is for diamonds\n\n[MCA]\nRoses are red, the sky is blue\nI got my barrel at your neck, so what the fuck you gonna do\nIt's just two wheels and me, the wind in my eyes\nThe engine is the music and my nine's by my side\nCause you know Y-A-U-C-H\nI'm taking all emcees out in the place\nTakin' life as it comes, no fool am I\nI'm goin' off, gettin' paid, and I don't ask why\nPlayin' beats on my box, makin' music for the many\nKnow a lot of def girls that\u2019ll do anything\nA lot of parents like to think I'm a villain\nI'm just chillin', like Bob Dylan\nYeah, I smoke cheeba, it helps me with my brain\nI might be a little dusted but I'm not insane\nPeople come up to me and they try to talk shit\nMan, I was making records when you were suckin' your mother's dick\n\n[Ad-Rock]\nGirl, you're walking tall now in your fancy clothes\nYou got fancy things, they're going up your nose\nYou're getting fancy gifts from expensive men\nYou're a dog on a leash, like a pig in a pen\nMothership connection, getting girls' affection\nIf your life needs correction, don't follow my direction\nYou got your 8 by 10, your agent, your Harley\nYou be driving around Hollywood with yo, 'Sorry, Charlie'\nCause I'm running things like some mack motherfucker\nYou slipin', you slackin', cause you're a false fake sucker\nYou slip, you slack; you clock me, and you lack\nWhile I'm reading \"On The Road\" by my man, Jack Kerouac\nPoetry in motion, coconut lotion\nHad to diss the girl because she got too emotional\nAre you experienced, little girl?\nI want to know what goes on in your little girl world\nCause I'm on your mind, it's hard to forget me\nI'll take your pride for a ride if you let me\nSo peace out, y'all, a

because Jimmy is the magnet\nI'm so rope, they call me Mr. Roper\nWhen the troubles arise, you know I'm the cool coper\nOn the mic I score, just like the Yankees\nGet over on Miss Crabtree like my main man Spankee\nExcuse me young lady, I don't mean to trouble ya\nBut you're lookin' so fly inside your BMW\nI got lucky, I brought home the kitten\nBefore I got busy, I slipped on the mitten\nCan't get better odds because I'm a sure thing\nProud Mary keeps on turning and rolling like a Ring-Ding\nJump the turnstiles, never pay the toll\nDoo-wah diddy and bust in with the pre-roll\nCustoms jailed me over an herb seed\nDon't rat on your boy over some rat weed\nI'm outta your back door, I'm into another\nYour boyfriend doesn't know about me and your mother\nNot perfect grammar, always perfect timing\nThe Mike stands for money and the D is for diamonds\n\n[MCA]\nRoses are red, the sky is blue\nI got my barrel at your neck, so what the fuck you gonna do\nIt's just two wheels and me, the wind in my eyes\nThe engine is the music and my nine's by my side\nCause you know Y-A-U-C-H\nI'm taking all emcees out in the place\nTakin' life as it comes, no fool am I\nI'm goin' off, gettin' paid, and I don't ask why\nPlayin' beats on my box, makin' music for the many\nKnow a lot of def girls that\u2019ll do anything\nA lot of parents like to think I'm a villain\nI'm just chillin', like Bob Dylan\nYeah, I smoke cheeba, it helps me with my brain\nI might be a little dusted but I'm not insane\nPeople come up to me and they try to talk shit\nMan, I was making records when you were suckin' your mother's dick\n\n[Ad-Rock]\nGirl, you're walking tall now in your fancy clothes\nYou got fancy things, they're going up your nose\nYou're getting fancy gifts from expensive men\nYou're a dog on a leash, like a pig in a pen\nMothership connection, getting girls' affection\nIf your life needs correction, don't follow my direction\nYou got your 8 by 10, your agent, your Harley\nYou be driving around Hollywood with yo, 'Sorry, Charlie'\nCause I'm running things like some mack motherfucker\nYou slipin', you slackin', cause you're a false fake sucker\nYou slip, you slack; you clock me, and you lack\nWhile I'm reading \"On The Road\" by my man, Jack Kerouac\nPoetry in motion, coconut lotion\nHad to diss the girl because she got too emotional\nAre you experienced, little girl?\nI want to know what goes on in your little girl world\nCause I'm on your mind, it's hard to forget me\nI'll take your pride for a ride if you let me\nSo peace out, y'all, a PCP, song out\nFull throttle to the bottle and full, full clout\nAnd I'm out"}}, {"title": "High Plains Drifter", "album": "Paul's Boutique", "year": "1989-07-25", "lyrics": "Cause I'm the high plains drifter, and I'm the drifter\nThe high plains drifter, and I'm the drifter\nThey can\u2019t catch me, they\u2019re never going to find me\nThey're never gonna know that I'm the high plains drifter\n\nPulled over to the river, to take a rest\nPulled out a pair of pliers pulled a bullet out of my chest\nFear and loathing 'cross the country, listenin' to my 8-track\nI reached behind the seat and snatched a Kool from the pack\nI'm long-distance from my girl and I'm talking on my cellular\nShe said that she was sorry and I said 'yeah the hell you were'\nCheck the rear view mirror, check the gold tooth display\nCheck the odometer and I was on my way\n\nCause I'm the high plains drifter the best that you can get\nA strapped shoplifter a pirate on cassette\nBust a Travis Bickle when I feel that I'm getting pushed\nDon't step to me cause you could be getting mushed\n\nI'm doing 120 plowing over mailboxes\nRadar detector to tell me where the cops is\nSpend another night at the Motel 6\nIt's five dollars extra to get the porno flicks\nAnd then I concoct a black and tan in my brandy snifter\nI'm a kleptomaniac K-mart shoplifter\nCash flow getting low, so I had to pull a job\nFound a nice place to visit but a better place to rob\nI left my car outside and the engine still revving\nTakin' care of business at 7-eleven\nAnd then I went inside to make my withdrawal\nI saw what he had had but I had to take it all\nKnucklehead deli tried to gyp me off the price\nSo I clocked him on the turban with a bag of ice\nCause I'm mellow like Jell-O, cool like lemonade\nI made my get a way and then I thought that I had it made\nI feel like Steve McQueen, a former movie star\nLooked in the rear view mirror seen the police car\nBallantine quarts with the puzzle on the cap\nI couldn't help to notice I was caught in a speed trap\nDirty Mary, Crazy Larry, on the run from Dirty Harry\nStash the cash in the dash, but my gun I did carry\nI'm seeing blue and red flashing deep in the night\nI got my alibi straight and I pulled over to the right\nThe cop knocked on my window and said \"Boy, where's the fire?\"\nYou got a mailbox on your bumper and a bald front tire\"\n\"Outta the car longhair!\" Your goose is cooked\nRead me my rights, fingerprinted and booked\n\nMaking like a DT, driving a grand fury\nWherever I hang my hat's my home and my past is kind of blurry\nEvery dog has his day mine will be in front of a jury\nHigh plains drifter you know that I'm never in a hurry\n\nRead me my rights as if I didn't know this\nThrew me in the tank with a drunk called Otis\nWith his 5 o'clock shadow he smelled of 3 day old beer\nMy man turned to me and said, \"Why are you here?\"\nI said, I'm charming, I'm dashing, I'm rental-car bashing\nI'm phony-paper passing at Nix Check Cashing\nI went before the judge he sent me to the Brooklyn house of D\nHe said, \"You behave or we'll throw away the key\"\nHoudini'd out the cuffs, kicked the screw in the knee\nI took the Bailiff's wallet and went straight to OTB\nI had a good feeling easy come easy go\nI bet on one horse to win and your mother to show\nAnd sure enough, that nag came in\nBrought my ticket to the window and collected my win\nAnd then I broke into my new car with a wire coat hanger\nHot-wired hot wheeled and, \"Suzy is a headbanger\"", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bcaa525dc53df04903f585df46d5bd5e.600x600x1.jpg", "artist": "Beastie Boys", "raw":

drifter, and I'm the drifter\nThey can\u2019t catch me, they\u2019re never going to find me\nThey're never gonna know that I'm the high plains drifter\n\nPulled over to the river, to take a rest\nPulled out a pair of pliers pulled a bullet out of my chest\nFear and loathing 'cross the country, listenin' to my 8-track\nI reached behind the seat and snatched a Kool from the pack\nI'm long-distance from my girl and I'm talking on my cellular\nShe said that she was sorry and I said 'yeah the hell you were'\nCheck the rear view mirror, check the gold tooth display\nCheck the odometer and I was on my way\n\nCause I'm the high plains drifter the best that you can get\nA strapped shoplifter a pirate on cassette\nBust a Travis Bickle when I feel that I'm getting pushed\nDon't step to me cause you could be getting mushed\n\nI'm doing 120 plowing over mailboxes\nRadar detector to tell me where the cops is\nSpend another night at the Motel 6\nIt's five dollars extra to get the porno flicks\nAnd then I concoct a black and tan in my brandy snifter\nI'm a kleptomaniac K-mart shoplifter\nCash flow getting low, so I had to pull a job\nFound a nice place to visit but a better place to rob\nI left my car outside and the engine still revving\nTakin' care of business at 7-eleven\nAnd then I went inside to make my withdrawal\nI saw what he had had but I had to take it all\nKnucklehead deli tried to gyp me off the price\nSo I clocked him on the turban with a bag of ice\nCause I'm mellow like Jell-O, cool like lemonade\nI made my get a way and then I thought that I had it made\nI feel like Steve McQueen, a former movie star\nLooked in the rear view mirror seen the police car\nBallantine quarts with the puzzle on the cap\nI couldn't help to notice I was caught in a speed trap\nDirty Mary, Crazy Larry, on the run from Dirty Harry\nStash the cash in the dash, but my gun I did carry\nI'm seeing blue and red flashing deep in the night\nI got my alibi straight and I pulled over to the right\nThe cop knocked on my window and said \"Boy, where's the fire?\"\nYou got a mailbox on your bumper and a bald front tire\"\n\"Outta the car longhair!\" Your goose is cooked\nRead me my rights, fingerprinted and booked\n\nMaking like a DT, driving a grand fury\nWherever I hang my hat's my home and my past is kind of blurry\nEvery dog has his day mine will be in front of a jury\nHigh plains drifter you know that I'm never in a hurry\n\nRead me my rights as if I didn't know this\nThrew me in the tank with a drunk called Otis\nWith his 5 o'clock shadow he smelled of 3 day old beer\nMy man turned to me and said, \"Why are you here?\"\nI said, I'm charming, I'm dashing, I'm rental-car bashing\nI'm phony-paper passing at Nix Check Cashing\nI went before the judge he sent me to the Brooklyn house of D\nHe said, \"You behave or we'll throw away the key\"\nHoudini'd out the cuffs, kicked the screw in the knee\nI took the Bailiff's wallet and went straight to OTB\nI had a good feeling easy come easy go\nI bet on one horse to win and your mother to show\nAnd sure enough, that nag came in\nBrought my ticket to the window and collected my win\nAnd then I broke into my new car with a wire coat hanger\nHot-wired hot wheeled and, \"Suzy is a headbanger\""}}, {"title": "Pass the Mic", "album": "Check Your Head", "year": "1992-04-07", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nGoodness

bust a move (what?)\nI drink quarts and cans and bottles and sixes (what up?)\nBetween the turntables keep the vodka and the mixes\n\nWell, I'm Mike D, I got the deuces wild (yeah boy)\nA list of girlies numbers that I've dialed\nI do the Smurf, the Popeye, and the Jerry Lewis\nI like Bullwinkle but I don't like Brutus\n\nWell, I'm schoolin' in the boys' room, coolin' by the locker (well)\nAll the girls in class knows that I'm the cool rocker (uh, yeah)\nPunk in the hall, man, I should of, ought to hit him\nHad the fresh rhymes and the kid cold bit 'em\n\nSmokin' in the boys room is what I do best\nWhile you were at a party, your girlfriend fessed (Check it)\nI keep a pistol in my pocket so you better be cautious\nFly around the world, but it makes me nauseous\nMike D.'s day off everyday of the week (ah, D, keep it on)\nI got to the party - and I did the freak\n\nI got a girl in the Castle and one in the pagoda\nYou know I got rhymes like Abe Vigoda\nI'm a Def Manhattan killer - a rhyme thriller\nA mic in my hand (bust it) and a mouth full of Miller\n\nI got a hat, not a visor - I drink Budweiser\nThe turntables, up on the drum riser\nThe needle's in the groove and the vinyl's on the platter\nI know that I'm fly; man, there's no need to flatter\nI travel around the globe, it's keeping girlies dizzy\nMy name's Mike D. - now watch me get busy, y'all\n\nG-g-get busy y'all\nG-g-get busy y'all\n\nYou're a fake wearin' sucker whose gold got rusted\nDusted, rusted, mustard, 'sgusted\nCheaper than a hot dog with no mustard\nMustard, mustard, mustard, mustard\nYou tried to steal my fresh and you got cold busted\nBusted, busted, busted, busted\nBecause your crew's all soft and I'm disgusted\n'sgusted, 'sgusted,  'sgusted\n\nI'm from downtown the city from of Manhattan\nI got a lotta girlies and not one's cattin'\nMy posse's in effect and we're doin' the do\nAnd we got more rhymes than your whole damn crew\nCaught you poppin' that weak and you must have been dusted\nDusted, dusted, dusted, dusted\nStuck your head in the toilet and stone cold flushed it\nFlushed it, flushed it, flushed it, flushed it\nWord"}}, {"title": "Body Movin'", "album": "Hello

So\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Outro]\n\"You will do eight hops on the left, eight on the right\nFour left, four right, two left, two right, the one each\nLeft right, left right.

the block\nCause I say my rhymes loud and I say 'em nonstop\nBecause being bad news is what we're all about\nWe went to White Castle and we got thrown out\n\nI got my boy Mike D. - I got the King Adrock\nI got the jammy with the ammo inside my sock\nI shot homeboy but the bullet was a dud\nSo I reached in the Miller cooler, grabbed a cool Bud\n\nSlow riding, gun hidin', on the go\nI'm fly like an eagle and I drink Old Crow\nI'm the king of the classroom, coolin' in the back\nMy teacher had beef so I gave her a smack\n\nShe chased me out of class, she was strapped with a ruler\nWent to the bathroom, rolled myself a wooler\nWith bottle in hand, at the microphone stand\nAy, yo, homeboy - what you drinkin', man?\n\nI got money - I got juice\nI got to the party and I got loose\nI got rhythms - I got rhymes\nI got the girlies with the def behinds\nI got ill - I got busted\nI got dust and I got dusted\nI got gold - I got funky\nI got the new dance they call the Brass Monkey\n\nBecause I'm hard hittin' - always bitten - cool as hell\nI got trees on my mirror so my car won't smell\nSittin' around the house - gettin' high and watchin' tube\nEating Colonel's chicken - drinkin' Heineken brew\nI'm a gangster, I'm a prankster - I'm the king of the ave\nI'm hated, confrontated for the juice that I have\nAll the fine ladies are making a fuss\nBut I can't pay attention -

about\nWe went to White Castle and we got thrown out\n\nI got my boy Mike D. - I got the King Adrock\nI got the jammy with the ammo inside my sock\nI shot homeboy but the bullet was a dud\nSo I reached in the Miller cooler, grabbed a cool Bud\n\nSlow riding, gun hidin', on the go\nI'm fly like an eagle and I drink Old Crow\nI'm the king of the classroom, coolin' in the back\nMy teacher had beef so I gave her a smack\n\nShe chased me out of class, she was strapped with a ruler\nWent to the bathroom, rolled myself a wooler\nWith bottle in hand, at the microphone stand\nAy, yo, homeboy - what you drinkin', man?\n\nI got money - I got juice\nI got to the party and I got loose\nI got rhythms - I got rhymes\nI got the girlies with the def behinds\nI got ill - I got busted\nI got dust and I got dusted\nI got gold - I got funky\nI got the new dance they call the Brass Monkey\n\nBecause I'm hard hittin' - always bitten - cool as hell\nI got trees on my mirror so my car won't smell\nSittin' around the house - gettin' high and watchin' tube\nEating Colonel's chicken - drinkin' Heineken brew\nI'm a gangster, I'm a prankster - I'm the king of the ave\nI'm hated, confrontated for the juice that I have\nAll the fine ladies are making a fuss\nBut I can't pay attention - cause I'm on that dust"}}, {"title": "She\u2019s Crafty", "album": "Licensed to Ill", "year":

def and she wanted to go\nI think her name is Lucy but they all call Loose\nI think I thought I seen her on eighth and forty-deuce\nThe next thing she said, \"My place or yours?\nLet's kick some bass behind closed doors!\"\nWe got into the cab - the cab driver said\nHe recognized my girlie from the back of her head\nHe said a little something about tip to base\nSo I made him stop the cab to get out of the place\nI shouldn't have looked back, man, I'll always regret it\nSomething's going on and I'll probably never get it\nShe was crying like a baby - stupid dumb\nIt's just too bad that girl's a bum\n\n(chorus) She's crafty - she gets around\nShe's crafty - she's always down\nShe's crafty - she's got a gripe\nShe's crafty - and she's just my type\nShe's crafty\n\nI spent my last dollar to buy a Sabrett\nWhen I seen this girl I could never forget\nNow, I like nothing better than a pretty girl smile\nAnd I haven't seen a smile that pretty in a while\nThe girl came up to me, she said she loved the show\nAsked her to come home and she couldn't say no\nWe got to the crib - there's Adam and D\nWe didn't say a word - they just stared at me\nI said, \"I don't know her - I just met her tonight.\"\nAnd Adrock started hiding everything in sight\nD pulled me over - said hide your gold\nThe girl is crafty like ice is cold\nThe girl is crafty - she knows all the moves\nI started playing records - she knew all the grooves\nHe thought she was a thief - and D was right\nBut I just figured she'd spend the night\nWhen I woke up late in the afternoon\nShe had taken all the things from inside his room\nI found myself naked in the middle of the floor\nShe had taken the bed and the chest of drawers\nThe mirror, the TV, the new guitar cord\nMy remote control and my old skateboard\nShe robbed us blind - she took all we owned\nAnd the boys blamed me for bringing her home\n\nShe's crafty, she gets around\nShe's crafty, she's always down\nShe's crafty, she's got a gripe\nShe's crafty and she's just my type\nShe's crafty\n\nUh, yeah\n\n(repeat chorus x2)", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/b7b6c1f973b0155bdf698fa46415f3a7.450x471x1.jpg", "artist": "Beastie Boys", "raw":

seen her around\nI thought they were right but I didn't want to know\nThe girlie was def and she wanted to go\nI think her name is Lucy but they all call Loose\nI think I thought I seen her on eighth and forty-deuce\nThe next thing she said, \"My place or yours?\nLet's kick some bass behind closed doors!\"\nWe got into the cab - the cab driver said\nHe recognized my girlie from the back of her head\nHe said a little something about tip to base\nSo I made him stop the cab to get out of the place\nI shouldn't have looked back, man, I'll always regret it\nSomething's going on and I'll probably never get it\nShe was crying like a baby - stupid dumb\nIt's just too bad that girl's a bum\n\n(chorus) She's crafty - she gets around\nShe's crafty - she's always down\nShe's crafty - she's got a gripe\nShe's crafty - and she's just my type\nShe's crafty\n\nI spent my last dollar to buy a Sabrett\nWhen I seen this girl I could never forget\nNow, I like nothing better than a pretty girl smile\nAnd I haven't seen a smile that pretty in a while\nThe girl came up to me, she said she loved the show\nAsked her to come home and she couldn't say no\nWe got to the crib - there's Adam and D\nWe didn't say a word - they just stared at me\nI said, \"I don't know her - I just met her tonight.\"\nAnd Adrock started hiding everything in sight\nD pulled me over - said hide your gold\nThe girl is crafty like ice is cold\nThe girl is crafty - she knows all the moves\nI started playing records - she knew all the grooves\nHe thought she was a thief - and D was right\nBut I just figured she'd spend the night\nWhen I woke up late in the afternoon\nShe had taken all the things from inside his room\nI found myself naked in the middle of the floor\nShe had taken the bed and the chest of drawers\nThe mirror, the TV, the new guitar cord\nMy remote control and my old skateboard\nShe robbed us blind - she took all we owned\nAnd the boys blamed me for bringing her home\n\nShe's crafty, she gets around\nShe's crafty, she's always down\nShe's crafty, she's got a gripe\nShe's crafty and she's just my type\nShe's crafty\n\nUh, yeah\n\n(repeat chorus x2)"}}, {"title": "Car Thief",

In the pool hall\nHit a motherfucker's face with the cue ball\nAnd I met this girl, she tried to gank me\nSo I smacked her in the booty with a plank, B\nCause me and my crew are out breaking windows\nThe Bingo, the lotto, you know I'll never win those\nPossession is half the law\nI had my routines before all y'all\nYour whole life is coming apart at the seams\nYou ain't nothing but a car thief biting routines\nSee I'm a city slicker\nI, I ain't no townie\nRight now, I wish I had another hash brownie\nAnd like Ricky always said, you've got to toke and pass\nOr Mookie's gonna' kick your motherfucking ass\nTry to take what isn't yours like a Goddamn rat\nSee I, personally, I wouldn't even wanna' go out like that\n\nI'm a writer, a poet, a genius, I know it\nI don't buy cheeba, I grow it\n(\"I'm a farmer\")\nPeople always trying to get next to me\nI had a beautiful experience on ecstasy\nI smoked up a bag of elephant tranquilizer\nBecause I had to deal with a money-hungry miser\nHad a caine filled Kool with my man, Rush Rush\nSaw my teeth fall in the sink when I started to brush\nYou be doing nose candy on the Bowie coke mirror\nMy girl asked for some but I pretended not to hear her\nYou can't deny me, you always want to try me\nYo, you're just gonna get your ass kicked\nHomeboy, throw in the towel\nYour girl got dicked by Ricky Powell\nThe Godfather of Soul in the belly of the beast\nSmoking that dust at St. Anthony's Feast\n\nAll the wife beaters and all the tax cheaters\nSitting in the White House pulling their peters\nBuy my cheeba from the cop down the street\nThe only cop with a rope chain when he's walking the beat\nSo like a sneaky pouch time-bomb ticking\nA-like the beat to my rhyme just kicking\nSpace cake cookies\nI discover who I am\nI'm a dusted old bummy Hurdy Gurdy Man\nFive-oh caught me now I'm going to the mountains\nSaid good-bye to my girl, my lawyer and accountants\nMy mind is kinda rhyming and I think I oughta think\nSo I'm rockin all the rhymes, and I'll have another drink\nSo the lights are flashing, my mind is spinning\nI feel like it is always the beginning\nOf another rhyme\nI'm rapping, emceeing, I rock\nYou ain't nothing but a car thief who must be stopped"}}, {"title": "Looking Down the Barrel of a Gun", "album": "Paul's Boutique", "year": "1989-07-25", "lyrics": "I'm rolling down the hill, snowballing, getting bigger\nAn explosion in the chamber, the hammer from the trigger\nI seen him get stabbed, I watched the blood spill out\nHe had more cuts than my man, Chuck Chillout\n24 is my age and 22 is my gauge\nI'm writing rhymes on a page, I'm goin' off in a rage\nCause I'm out on a mission, a stolen car mission\nHad a small problem with the transmission\nThree on the tree in the middle of the night\nI have this steak on my head cause I got into a fist fight\nLife comes in phases, take the good with the bad\nYou bought the coins on the street (Holmes), and you know you got had\nBecause it's all high spirit, you know you got to hear it\nDon't touch the mic, baby, don't come near it\n\nIt's gonna get you, it's gonna get you\nIt's gonna get you, girl, it's gonna get you\n\nLooking down the barrel of a gun\nSon of a gun, son of a bitch\nGetting paid, getting rich\n\nUltra violence be running through my head\nCold medina, y'all, makin' me see red\nRapid fire Louie, like Rambo got bullets\nI'm a die harder, like my kid Bruce Willis\nI love girlies, waxing and milking\nCoordinating trim is my man, Dave Scilken\nPredetermined destiny is who I am\nYou got your finger on the trigger like the Son of Sam I am\nLike Clockwork Orange, going off on the town\nI've got homeboys bonanza to beat your ass down\nWell, I'm mad at my desk, and I'll be writing all curse words\nExpressing my aggressions through my schizophrenic verse words\nYou're a headless chicken chasin', a sucker freebasin\nYou're looking for a fist to put your face in\nWell, get hip, get hip, don't slip ya knuckle heads\nRacism is schism, on a serious tip", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bcaa525dc53df04903f585df46d5bd5e.600x600x1.jpg", "artist": "Beastie Boys", "raw": {"annotation_count": 19, "api_path": "/songs/1951", "apple_music_id": "723654655", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/1951/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "This is Track #10 on Paul\u2019s Boutique, released 7.25.1989 on Capitol Records.

the chamber, the hammer from the trigger\nI seen him get stabbed, I watched the blood spill out\nHe had more cuts than my man, Chuck Chillout\n24 is my age and 22 is my gauge\nI'm writing rhymes on a page, I'm goin' off in a rage\nCause I'm out on a mission, a stolen car mission\nHad a small problem with the transmission\nThree on the tree in the middle of the night\nI have this steak on my head cause I got into a fist fight\nLife comes in phases, take the good with the bad\nYou bought the coins on the street (Holmes), and you know you got had\nBecause it's all high spirit, you know you got to hear it\nDon't touch the mic, baby, don't come near it\n\nIt's gonna get you, it's gonna get you\nIt's gonna get you, girl, it's gonna get you\n\nLooking down the barrel of a gun\nSon of a gun, son of a bitch\nGetting paid, getting rich\n\nUltra violence be running through my head\nCold medina, y'all, makin' me see red\nRapid fire Louie, like Rambo got bullets\nI'm a die harder, like my kid Bruce Willis\nI love girlies, waxing and milking\nCoordinating trim is my man, Dave Scilken\nPredetermined destiny is who I am\nYou got your finger on the trigger like the Son of Sam I am\nLike Clockwork Orange, going off on the town\nI've got homeboys bonanza to beat your ass down\nWell, I'm mad at my desk, and I'll be writing all curse words\nExpressing my aggressions through my schizophrenic verse words\nYou're a headless chicken chasin', a sucker freebasin\nYou're looking for a fist to put your face in\nWell, get hip, get hip, don't slip ya knuckle heads\nRacism is schism, on a serious tip"}}, {"title": "Too Many Rappers", "album": "Hot Sauce Committee Part 2", "year": "2011-04-27", "lyrics": "[Intro - Nas]\nMic check, mic check\n\n[Hook - Nas] (Beastie Boys)\nOne (one), two (two), three (three)\nToo many rappers, and there's still not enough MCs\nIt goes three (three), two (two), one (one)\nMCA, Adrock, Mike D, that's how we get it done\nLike ladies and gents, attention\nNas in the house with Beastie Boys\nWe can turn it out\nPerpetrators, we can point 'em out\nSo if you got somethin' on your mind, let it out\n\n[MCA]\nYo, I been in the game since before you was born\nI might still be MCing even after you're gone\nStrange thought, I know, but my skills still grow\nThe 80s, the 90s, 2000s, and so\nOn and on until the crack of dawn\nUntil the year 3000 and beyond\nStay up all night, and I MC and never die\nCause death is the cousin of sleep\n\n[Ad-Rock]\nBecause I'm back with a bang, boogie, oogie-oogie\nStrawberry Letter 23 like Shuggie\nOh my God, just look at me\nGrandpa been rappin' since '83\nI'm supersonic like J.J. Fad\nGot crazy-ass shit pullin' out the bag\nDon't forget the tartar sauce, yo, cause it's sad\nAll these crab rappers, they're rappin' like crabs\n\n[Nas]\nI have carte blanche, the vagabond\nNas is the narcissist, my pockets are rotund\nI'm no killa, but compared to you, I'm more real'a\nYou ain't a shot, a mobster, or a drug dealer\nA slug peeler, you're not\nMafioso, no\nYou ain't got the cut-throat in ya, beginner\nI ain't tryin' to hear your racket\nYou work with police, dog, you snitch, you rat\nYou wear that jacket\n\n[Mike D]\nHow many rappers must get dissed\nGimme eight bars, and watch me bless this\nI start to reminisce, ooh, when I miss\nThe real hip hop with which I persist\nLike rum in mojitos\nBullets and banditos\nMatzoh balls in soup\nJackets and troop\nYes, y'all, this is one for the history books\nNasty Nas, what's the word?\nCount it off on the hook\n\n[Hook]\n\n[MCA]\nCause this the type of lyric goes inside your brain\nTo blow you bullshit rappers straight out the frame\nMy lyrics spin 'round like a hurricane twister\nSo get your hologram on off-a Wolf Blitzer\nToo many rappers to shake a stick at\nI oughta charge a tax for every weak rap I had to listen to\nCause we be makin' stacks like Stax Records\nMy squad, we gotta pact -- we're never coming wack\n\n[Ad-Rock]\nTo all you crab rappers and hackers\nAnd circuit benders tweaked on Splenda\nI take the cake, I stole the mold\nThe golden microphone, well, that's mine to hold\nAnd why all these biters all up in my crotchspace?\nSniffin', buffin', huffin'\nAnd mean muggin' with a Blimpie Bluffin\nBack up off me, suckas, you ain't sayin' nothin'\n\n[Nas]\nI'm broader than Broadway, I was the project hallway\nDual tape recorder, lacin' oratorials all day\nI'm just getting started on this beat, this is foreplay\nAnd when this song's finished, y'all can sing along with this\nBy the way, I have a strong fetish for Christian Louboutin steppers\nI hear Russian blonde's the wettest\nBut anyway, I better pay homage to my fellas\nAnd that's what's on my mind and the rhyme, who's next up?\n\n[Mike D]\nMike D, the man of mystery\nHistory in the makin', and now we're takin'\nTitles, awards, and accolades\nScarin' the competition as I sharpen my blades\nWe come together like peanut butter and sandwiches\nLike pen and paper, like Picasso and canvases\nRockin' stadiums and shitty bars\nGo back in time, send a fax from my car\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/025d754c8a114f32270a6c7517d3bb90.1000x1000x1.png", "artist": "Beastie Boys", "raw": {"annotation_count": 19, "api_path": "/songs/900", "apple_music_id": "715797914", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/900/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "What do you get when you mix three pioneering MCs from Brooklyn/Manhattan with a legendary MC from Queensbridge?\n\nA pretty ballin' track, evidently\u2026\n\nNas joins the Beastie Boys in pondering one of life\u2019s greatest mysteries\u2026\n\nWhy are there so few MCs, and so many rappers?\n\n\n\nThis is the \u201cToo Many Rappers\u201d (Single Version) dropped via 12\u201d US Promo on 7.21.2009 \u2014 NOT to be confused with the \u201cToo Many Rappers (New Reactionaries Version)\u201c, included on the HSCP2 LP.

(one), two (two), three (three)\nToo many rappers, and there's still not enough MCs\nIt goes three (three), two (two), one (one)\nMCA, Adrock, Mike D, that's how we get it done\nLike ladies and gents, attention\nNas in the house with Beastie Boys\nWe can turn it out\nPerpetrators, we can point 'em out\nSo if you got somethin' on your mind, let it out\n\n[MCA]\nYo, I been in the game since before you was born\nI might still be MCing even after you're gone\nStrange thought, I know, but my skills still grow\nThe 80s, the 90s, 2000s, and so\nOn and on until the crack of dawn\nUntil the year 3000 and beyond\nStay up all night, and I MC and never die\nCause death is the cousin of sleep\n\n[Ad-Rock]\nBecause I'm back with a bang, boogie, oogie-oogie\nStrawberry Letter 23 like Shuggie\nOh my God, just look at me\nGrandpa been rappin' since '83\nI'm supersonic like J.J. Fad\nGot crazy-ass shit pullin' out the bag\nDon't forget the tartar sauce, yo, cause it's sad\nAll these crab rappers, they're rappin' like crabs\n\n[Nas]\nI have carte blanche, the vagabond\nNas is the narcissist, my pockets are rotund\nI'm no killa, but compared to you, I'm more real'a\nYou ain't a shot, a mobster, or a drug dealer\nA slug peeler, you're not\nMafioso, no\nYou ain't got the cut-throat in ya, beginner\nI ain't tryin' to hear your racket\nYou work with police, dog, you snitch, you rat\nYou wear that jacket\n\n[Mike D]\nHow many rappers must get dissed\nGimme eight bars, and watch me bless this\nI start to reminisce, ooh, when I miss\nThe real hip hop with which I persist\nLike rum in mojitos\nBullets and banditos\nMatzoh balls in soup\nJackets and troop\nYes, y'all, this is one for the history books\nNasty Nas, what's the word?\nCount it off on the hook\n\n[Hook]\n\n[MCA]\nCause this the type of lyric goes inside your brain\nTo blow you bullshit rappers straight out the frame\nMy lyrics spin 'round like a hurricane twister\nSo get your hologram on off-a Wolf Blitzer\nToo many rappers to shake a stick at\nI oughta charge a tax for every weak rap I had to listen to\nCause we be makin' stacks like Stax Records\nMy squad, we gotta pact -- we're never coming wack\n\n[Ad-Rock]\nTo all you crab rappers and hackers\nAnd circuit benders tweaked on Splenda\nI take the cake, I stole the mold\nThe golden microphone, well, that's mine to hold\nAnd why all these biters all up in my crotchspace?\nSniffin', buffin', huffin'\nAnd mean muggin' with a Blimpie Bluffin\nBack up off me, suckas, you ain't sayin' nothin'\n\n[Nas]\nI'm broader than Broadway, I was the project hallway\nDual tape recorder, lacin' oratorials all day\nI'm just getting started on this beat, this is foreplay\nAnd when this song's finished, y'all can sing along with this\nBy the way, I have a strong fetish for Christian Louboutin steppers\nI hear Russian blonde's the wettest\nBut anyway, I better pay homage to my fellas\nAnd that's what's on my mind and the rhyme, who's next up?\n\n[Mike D]\nMike D, the man of mystery\nHistory in the makin', and now we're takin'\nTitles, awards, and accolades\nScarin' the competition as I sharpen my blades\nWe come together like peanut butter and sandwiches\nLike pen and paper, like Picasso and canvases\nRockin' stadiums and shitty bars\nGo back in time, send a fax from my car\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "Three MC's and One DJ", "album": "Hello Nasty", "year": "1999-01-03", "lyrics": "[Intro]\n(\"Hey, yo, Adam what's up?

wine cooler\n\nJohnny Ryall is the bum on my stoop\nI gave him fifty cents to buy some soup\nHe knows the time with the fresh Gucci watch\nHe's even more over than my mayor, Ed Koch\nWashing windows on the Bowery at a quarter to four\nCause he ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more\nLivin' on borrowed time and borrowed money\nSleepin' on the street, there ain't a damn thing funny\nWith the hand-me-down food, and the hand-me-down clothes\nA rockabilly past of which nobody knows\nMakes his home all over the place\nHe goes to sleep by falling down on his face\nSometimes known as the leader of the homeless\nSometimes drunk and he's always phoneless\nSleepin' on the street in a cardboard box\nHe's better off drinkin' than smokin' the rocks\n\nWell...\nJohnny Ryall, Johnny Ryall\nKickin' uptown, kickin' downtown, kickin' crosstown\nJohnny Ryall, Johnny Ryall\n\nHe drinks where he lies, he's covered with flies\nHe's got the hand me down Pumas and the tie dyes\nWell, go upstate and get your head together\nThunderbird is the word, and you're light as a feather\nDetox at the flop house, no booze allowed\nRemember the good old days with the rockabilly crowd\nMemphis is where he's from (in Tennessee)\nHe lives in the street but he's no bum\nA rockabilly star from the days of old\nHe used to have teeth all filled with gold\nA platinum voice, but only gold records\nOn the bass was Boots on the drums was Checkers\nLuis Vuitton with the Gucci guitar\nJohnny Ryall\nWho do you think you are\n\nJohnny Ryall, Johnny Ryall\nDrinkin' night train, drinkin' O.E\nJohnny Ryall, Johnny Ryall\n\nOne, two, three, four\nOne, two, three, four\nOne, two, three, four\nOne, two, three...\n\nDonald Trump and Donald Tramp living in the men's Shelter\nWonderbread bag shoes and singing Helter Skelter\nHe asks for a dollar, you know what it's for\nMan, bottle after bottle, he always needs more\nHe's no less important than you working class stiffs\nDrinks a lot of liquor, but he don't drink piss\nHe paid his dues playing the blues\nHe claims that he wrote the Blue Suede Shoes\nElvis shaved his head when he went into the army\nThat's right y'all his name is Johnny, kick it\n\nJohnny Ryall, Johnny Ryall\nJohnny Ryall, Johnny Ryall\n\nCheck the cool wax!"}}, {"title": "An Open Letter to NYC", "album": "To the 5 Boroughs", "year": "2004-06-15", "lyrics": "Listen, All You New Yorkers\n\nBrooklyn, Bronx, Queens and Staten\nFrom the Battery to the top of Manhattan\nAsian, Middle-Eastern and Latin\nBlack, White, New York you make it happen\n\nBrownstones, water towers, trees, skyscrapers\nWriters, prize fighters and Wall Street traders\nWe come together on the subway cars\nDiversity unified, whoever you are\nWe're doing fine on the One and Nine line\nOn the L we're doin' swell\nOn the number Ten bus we fight and fuss\nCause we're thorough in the boroughs and that's a must\nI remember when the Deuce was all porno flicks\nRunning home after school to play PIXX\nAt lunch I'd go to Blimpies down on Montague Street\nAnd hit the Fulton Street Mall for the sneakers on my feet\nDear New York, I hope you're doing well\nI know a lot's happen and you've been through hell\nSo, we give thanks for providing a home\nThrough your gates at Ellis Island we passed in droves\n\nBrooklyn, Bronx, Queens, and Staten\nFrom the Battery to the top of Manhattan\nAsian, Middle-Eastern and Latin\nBlack, White, New York you make it happen\n\nThe L.I.E., the BQE\nHippies at the band shell with the LSD\nGet my BVD's from VIM\nYou know I'm reppin' Manhattan the best I can\nStopped off at Bleeker Bob's got thrown out\nSneakin' in at 4:00 am after going out\nYou didn't rob me in the park at Diana Ross\nBut everybody started looting when the light went off\nFrom the South South Bronx, on out to Queensbridge\nFrom Hollis Queens right down to Bay Ridge\nFrom Castle Hill to the Lower East Side\nFrom 1010 WINS to Live At Five\nDear New York, this is a love letter\nTo you and how you brought us together\nWe can't say enough about all you do\nCause in the city were ourselves and electric, too\n\nBrooklyn, Bronx, Queens, and Staten\nFrom the Battery to the top of Manhattan\nAsian, Middle-Eastern, and Latin\nBlack, White, New York you make it happen\n\nShout out the South Bronx where my mom hails from\nRight next to High Bridge across from Harlem\nTo the Grand Concourse where my mom and dad met\nBefore they moved on down to the Upper West\nI see you're still strong after all that's gone on\nLife long we dedicate this song\nJust a little something to show some respect\nTo the city that blends and mends and tests\nSince 911, we're still livin'\nAnd lovin\u2019, life we've been given\nAin't nothing gonna' take that away from us\nWere lookin' pretty and gritty cause in the city we trust\nDear New York, I know a lot has changed\n2 towers down, but you're still in the game\nHome to the many, rejecting no one\nAccepting peoples of all places, wherever they're from\n\nBrooklyn, Bronx, Queens, and Staten\nFrom the Battery to the top of Manhattan\nAsian, Middle-Eastern, and Latin\nBlack, White, New York you make it happen", "image":

little chuckle\nYou're gonna get smacked with my gold finger knuckle\nCause being as fly as me is something that you never thought of\nYou'll be stickin up old ladies with the handgun or the sawed-off\nI'm a buffalo soldier, broader than Broadway\nKeep keepin' on, I don't care what they say\nI play my stereo loud, I disturb my neighbors\nI want to enjoy the fruits of my labor\n\nCause I am the holder of the three-pack bonanza\nIf you open the book, then you will get your hand slapped\nI am the keeper of the three-pack bonanza\nIf you ask a question, then you will get the answer\n\nHer breast, I saw, I reached, I felt\nM, O-N, E-Y, the belt\nI stay at home, just, like a hermit\nI got the jammy but I don't got the permit (you know why)\nYou got a boyfriend, and his name is Nick\nAnnabelle caught with the shrimpy limp dick\nI ride around town cause my ride is fly\nI shot a man in Brooklyn (\"just to watch him die\")"}}, {"title": "Michelle's Farm", "album": "Pollywog

music - first things first\nFirst of all - get off the wall\nIt's time to party so have a ball\nWe slowed it on down - so get the hell up\nLike a volcano, I'll erupt\nWe got determination - bass and highs\nWhite Castle fries only come in one size\nWhat you see is what you get\nAnd you ain't seen - nothing yet\n\n\nLet it flow - let yourself go\nSlow and low - that is the tempo\nLet it flow - let yourself go\nSlow and low - that is the tempo\n\nI do not sing - but I make a Def song\nYou could live your whole life - and I hope you live long\nOn the Gong Show, we won't get gonged\nWe're the Beastie Boys - not Cheech and Chong\nStrong as a ox - fresh out the box\nThe crowd is so live - they're coming in flocks\nAnd when we go on - the crowd goes off\nIt's all hard rock - there's nothing

D makes three\nAnd we can do it like this in the place to be\nWhen I'm recorded - you'll be rewarded\nI know my song is Def cause you all applauded\nNot PCP or LSD - just me, Mike D, in the place to

go\nSlow and low - that is the tempo\n\nIt's never old school - all brand new\nSo everybody catch - the bugaloo flu\nNot like a fever - not like a cold\nThe beats are clear - the rhymes are bold\nSo don't see a doctor or see a nurse\nJust listen to the music - first things first\nFirst of all - get off the wall\nIt's time to party so have a ball\nWe slowed it on down - so get the hell up\nLike a volcano, I'll erupt\nWe got determination - bass and highs\nWhite Castle fries only come in one size\nWhat you see is what you get\nAnd you ain't seen - nothing yet\n\n\nLet it flow - let yourself go\nSlow and low - that is the tempo\nLet it flow - let yourself go\nSlow and low - that is the tempo\n\nI do not sing - but I make a Def song\nYou could live your whole life - and I hope you live long\nOn the Gong Show, we won't get gonged\nWe're the Beastie Boys - not Cheech and Chong\nStrong as a ox - fresh out the box\nThe crowd is so live - they're coming in flocks\nAnd when we go on - the crowd goes off\nIt's all hard rock - there's nothing soft\n\n\nLet it flow - let yourself go\nSlow and low - that is the tempo\nLet it flow - let yourself go\nSlow and low - that is the tempo\n\nCOD\n\nLet it flow - let yourself go\nSlow and low - that is the tempo\nLet it flow - let yourself go\nSlow and low - that is the tempo\n\nWe don't only rock the house but the house we rock\nWe don't stroll but we roll straight to the top\nMCA, Adrock, Mike D makes three\nAnd we can do it like this in the place to be\nWhen I'm recorded - you'll be rewarded\nI know my song is Def cause you all applauded\nNot PCP or LSD - just me, Mike D, in the place to be\nThis is not free - you must pay a fee\nCash on delivery like a COD\n\nLet it flow - let yourself go\nSlow and low - that is the tempo\nLet it flow - let yourself go\nSlow and low - that is the tempo\n\nThe beat is slow in order to dance\nI wanna hear \"I do\"s and no \"I can't\"\nFirst you move your legs - and then your arms\nIt's not fast and nervous - this dance is calm\nIt's truly stable and you ought to be able\nTo dance to the record when it's on the turntable\n\nLet it flow - let yourself go\nSlow and low - that is the tempo\nLet it flow - let yourself go\nSlow and low - that is the tempo\n\nLet it flow - let yourself go\nSlow and low - that is the tempo\nLet it flow - let yourself go\nSlow and low - that is the tempo"}}, {"title": "Dropping Names", "album": "Paul's Boutique", "year": "1989-07-25", "lyrics": "He thrusts his fists against the post and still insists he sees a ghost\nHe thrusts his

the center stage\nThe lights set low, and the night has come of age\nTake the microphone in hand as I am a professional\nSpeak my knowledge to the crowd, and the Ed is Special\nFor I am the Bard and I am the last one\nI am the king, and this is my castle\nDwell in realms of now, but vidi those of the past\nSeen a glimpse from ahead, and I don't think it's gonna last\nAnd you can bet your ass\n\nI drop the L when I'm skiin'\nI'm smokin and peakin\nI put the skis on the roof almost every single weekend\nCan't stop the mindfuck when it's rollin along\nCan't stop the smooth running when the shit's running strong\nBroke my bindings, the lion with wings\nPreaching his words in the b-boy sing\nI am one with myself, as I turn to thee\nPrefer the dreams to the reality\nI prefer my life, don't need no other man's wife\nDon't need no crazy lifestyle with stress and strife\nBut it's good to have a turn to be a king for a day\nOr for a week, or for a year, or for a year in a day\nCome what may...\n\nI'm fishin' in my boat and I'm fishing for trout\nMix the Bass Ale with the Guinness Stout\nFishing for a line inside my brain\nAnd looking out at the world through my window pane\nEvery day has many colors cause the glass is stained\nEverything has changed but remains the same\nSo once again the mirror raised, and I see myself as clear as day\nAnd I'm going to the limits of my ultimate destiny\nFeeling as though somebody, somewhere, is testing me\nHe who sees the end from the beginning of time\nLooking forward through all the ages is, was, and always shall be\nCheck the prophetic

as pray and hope, that the message is sent\nAnd I am living in the dreams that I have dreamt\nBecause I'm down with the three, the unstoppable three\nMe and Adam and D were born, to emcee\nAnd my body and soul and mind are pure\nNot polluted or diluted or damaged beyond cure\nJust lyrics from I to you, recited\nArrested, bailed, but cuffed and indicted\nEnter the arena as I take the center stage\nThe lights set low, and the night has come of age\nTake the microphone in hand as I am a professional\nSpeak my knowledge to the crowd, and the Ed is Special\nFor I am the Bard and I am the last one\nI am the king, and this is my castle\nDwell in realms of now, but vidi those of the past\nSeen a glimpse from ahead, and I don't think it's gonna last\nAnd you can bet your ass\n\nI drop the L when I'm skiin'\nI'm smokin and peakin\nI put the skis on the roof almost every single weekend\nCan't stop the mindfuck when it's rollin along\nCan't stop the smooth running when the shit's running strong\nBroke my bindings, the lion with wings\nPreaching his words in the b-boy sing\nI am one with myself, as I turn to thee\nPrefer the dreams to the reality\nI prefer my life, don't need no other man's wife\nDon't need no crazy lifestyle with stress and strife\nBut it's good to have a turn to be a king for a day\nOr for a week, or for a year, or for a year in a day\nCome what may...\n\nI'm fishin' in my boat and I'm fishing for trout\nMix the Bass Ale with the Guinness Stout\nFishing for a line inside my brain\nAnd looking out at the world through my window pane\nEvery day has many colors cause the glass is stained\nEverything has changed but remains the same\nSo once again the mirror raised, and I see myself as clear as day\nAnd I'm going to the limits of my ultimate destiny\nFeeling as though somebody, somewhere, is testing me\nHe who sees the end from the beginning of time\nLooking forward through all the ages is, was, and always shall be\nCheck the prophetic sections of the pages\n\nEZ Mike with the Disco Dave\n\nHe goes by the name of the D-D-D-Disco Dave\nDisco Dave, Disco Dave, Disco Dave\nDisco Dave, Disco Dave, Disco Dave\nDisco Dave, Disco Dave,

underwear\nRat soup eating, test cheating, no business punk\nYou're insecure, born in the junkyard with the junk\nYou've gone wet look crazy and messed with your head\nYou fucked around and wound up with the bald skin head\nYou're all mixed up, like pasta primavera\nYo, why'd you throw that chair at Geraldo Rivera, man?\nCause one man's ceiling is another man's floor\nSo get that money out of your ass, you whore\nWell, I brought her upstairs onto the roof\nI dogged your wife, and she is a doofus\n\nSo what goes around comes around\nAnd what goes around comes around\nWhat goes around comes around\nAnd what comes around goes around (goes around)\nChosen bound\nFully down\nFeeling down\nYo, Holmes, your nose is brown\n\nClean B, cleaning the G spot, you know that we've got\nThe Dolemite's house and you have not\nLook out my window, look over the city\nWith two black eyes, your girl ain't that pretty\nWhy you wanna beat that brat with a bat\nWhy you wanna treat your girl like that?\nLiving in the rat race, smoking rat weed\nWell, you reap what you sow when you plant the seed\nBum cheese on rye with ham and prosciutto\nGot more Louie than Phillip Rizzuto\n\nWhat goes around

it's leaking\nRapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair\nSo I can climb up and get into your underwear\nRat soup eating, test cheating, no business punk\nYou're insecure, born in the junkyard with the junk\nYou've gone wet look crazy and messed with your head\nYou fucked around and wound up with the bald skin head\nYou're all mixed up, like pasta primavera\nYo, why'd you throw that chair at Geraldo Rivera, man?\nCause one man's ceiling is another man's floor\nSo get that money out of your ass, you whore\nWell, I brought her upstairs onto the roof\nI dogged your wife, and she is a doofus\n\nSo what goes around comes around\nAnd what goes around comes around\nWhat goes around comes around\nAnd what comes around goes around (goes around)\nChosen bound\nFully down\nFeeling down\nYo, Holmes, your nose is brown\n\nClean B, cleaning the G spot, you know that we've got\nThe Dolemite's house and you have not\nLook out my window, look over the city\nWith two black eyes, your girl ain't that pretty\nWhy you wanna beat that brat with a bat\nWhy you wanna treat your girl like that?\nLiving in the rat race, smoking rat weed\nWell, you reap what you sow when you plant the seed\nBum cheese on rye with ham and prosciutto\nGot more Louie than Phillip Rizzuto\n\nWhat goes around comes around\nAnd what goes around comes around\nWhat goes around comes around\nAnd what comes around goes around\nWhat goes around comes around\nAnd what goes around inevitability\nComes around, what?\nAnd what goes around comes around\nWhat goes around, you know, it comes around\nWhat?\nCheck it, check it\nCheck it, what, what, what, what\nFunky damn, a funky Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam\nBam, bam, bam\nFD in the house, y'all\nFunky, funky, funky, funky, f-funky\nBam, bam, bam, bam\nFD\nFunky, funky, FD, funky, funky\nFuck it\nAh, everybody, funky Pam\nBam, bam, bam, slam, Alabama\nAnd kick it, Al-a-fucking-bama\nI slam a saki hammer\nAnd chilling\nFunky\nLike penicillin\nFunky\nLike panasaursas\nFunky\nDoris the Finkasaurus\nHa, he, ha, ha, ha"}}, {"title": "Hey Fuck You", "album": "To the 5 Boroughs", "year": "2004-06-15", "lyrics": "{Uh thank you ladies and gentlemen, this next

my rhyme book?\nLook, give it back, you're wicky-wack\nWith your ticky-tack calls\u2026  Didn't touch you at all\nI didn't touch your hand \u2014 man, you know it\u2019s all ball\n\n[Verse 2: MCA]\nYou sold a few records but don't get slick\nCause you used a corked bat to get those hits\nYou've been in the game, your career is long\nBut when you break it down you've only got 2 songs\n\n[Verse 3: Mike D]\nMC's are like clay pigeons when I'm shootin' skeet\nI just yell pull and Mike drops the beat\nYou people call yourselves MC's but you're garbage men\nTakin' out the trash when you pull out the pen\n\n[Hook-Line:]\nAnd if you don't like it, then hey fuck you!\n\n[Verse 4: Ad-Rock]\nI read about you up on page 6\nThey was trashin' your ass it's sad you're getting dissed\nNow talk about your face now don't get pissed\nBut I suggest you see a dermatologist\n\n[Verse 5: MCA]\nI keep that hot sauce hot - not mild and weak\nIt's gonna burn your mouth until you wet your beak\nI've got billions and billions of rhymes to flex\nCause I've got more rhymes than Carl Sagan's got turtlenecks\n\n[Verse 6: Mike D]\nYour rhymes are fake like a Canal Street watch\nYou're hearing me and you're like, \"Oh my god its Sasquatch!\"\nI'm walkin' on water while you're stepping in shit\nSo put your sewer boots on before your ass gets lit\n\n[Hook-Line:]\nAnd if you don't like it, then hey fuck you!\n\n[Sample:]\nSo put a quarter in your ass cause you played yourself\nSo put a quarter in your ass cause you played yourself\nSo put a quarter in your ass cause you played yourself\nSo put a quarter in your ass cause you played yourself\n\n[Hook:]\nAnd if you don't like it, then hey fuck you!\n\n[Verse 7: Ad-Rock]\nSucker MC\u2019s, it's me they're resenting\nIn the animal kingdom, they call it presenting\nWith the dipsy-doodle, the kit and caboodle\n\n[Verse 8: MCA]\nThe truth is brutal, your grandma's kugel\nKings County is my stomping ground\nThe Albee Square Mall, Brooklyn, Downtown\nSo don't ask me to wine and dine ya\nI'm from Brooklyn, you're from Regina\n\n[Verse 9: Mike D]\nYou're like Foghorn Leghorn, Yosemite Sam\nYou're just yellin' and wildin' wondering who I am\nWith those lies you're telling you're like Toucan Sam\nBut my style's impregnable like the Hoover Dam\n\n[Hook-Line:]\nAnd if you don't like it, then hey, fuck you!\nAnd if you

1-train\nThey'll be kicking out windows, high on cocaine\nAnd then I jump the turnstyle, I lost my last token\nRiding between the cars, pissing, smoking\nHead for the last car, fluorescent light blackout\nPoliceman told my homeboy, yo, put that crack out\nYou know you light up when the lights go down\nAnd then you read the New York Post, Fulton Street, downtown\nSame faces every day, but you don't know their names\nParty people going places on the D train\n\n{Stop that train, I wanna get off...}\n\nCheck it\nTrench coat, wingtip, going to work\nAnd you'll be pullin a train like you're Captain Kirk\nPickpocket gangsters, payin' their debts\nI caught a bullet in the lung from Bernhard Goetz\nOverworked and underpaid, starin at the floor\nProstitutes spandex caught in the slide doors\nNow stuck between the stations it seems like an eternity\nSweating like sardines in a flophouse fraternity\n$50.00 fine for disturbing the peace\nThe neck, tortoise, your Lees are creased\nHot cup of coffee and the donuts are Dunkin\nFriday night and Jamaica Queens funkin\nElevated platform, I'm never gonna conform\nRiding over the diner where I always get my toast warm\nBust into the

evil, see no evil, talkin' no bullshit\nSo many damn people are so damn full of it\nKeyboard Money Mark, you know he ain't havin' it\nJust give him some wood and he'll build you a cabinet\nI\u2019m convinced that Vince is rippin' me off\nI think it's his girdle that's tippin' me off\nWell, Mike D's out back and he's growin' onions\nI\u2019ve got bigger buns than my man Paul Bunyon's\nI\u2019ve been going nuts gettin' all cooped up\nFully hermitizing but now I\u2019m getting souped up\nIt's time to turn the page to a brand new chapter\nSettin' my sights and you know what I\u2019m after\nI\u2019ll be in the paper the news with Ernie Ernesto\nThey'll even print my recipe for pasta with pesto\nNow here's another special of the day\nI\u2019ve got more spice than the frugal gourmet\n\nIt's finger lickin', finger lickin' good, y'all\nFinger lickin', a finger lickin' good, y'all\nIt's finger lickin', finger lickin' good, y'all\nIt's finger lickin', finger lickin' good, y'all\n\nLickin'-lickin', uh\nLickin'-lickin', uh\nLickin'-lickin', uh\nLickin'-lickin', uh\n\nWell, Mike D (huh), what you got for me?\nShow these good people what it means to be D\nWell they call me Mike d with the mad man style I put\nI put the mic up to my lips and I can scream for a while\nCreated a sound at which many were shocked at\nI\u2019ve got a million ideas that I ain't even rocked yet\nI\u2019ve got the light bulb flashing at the top of my head\nNever wake up on the wrong side of the bed\nYou're an idea man, not a yes man\nWith a point to make, you're bound to take a stand\nCause I\u2019m Pete the Puma, Minnie the Moocher\nGot every type of flavor or style that will suit \u2018ya\nYou know the bass is real fat, because it's gotta\u2019 be like that\nA snare on the funky tin, and a taste of the high-hat\n\nFinger lickin', finger lickin' good, y'all\nFinger lickin', a finger lickin' good, y'all\nIt's finger lickin', it's finger lickin' good, y'all\nA finger lickin', a lickin', lickin' good, y'all\n\nYo, Yauch what's up?\nMike D, what's up?\nCome on Yauch, let's tear it up\nWell, I could catch a groove like a flash in the dark\nI grab a hold of your attention like a thief in the park\n\u2018Cause I can flip a rhyme off the tip of my tongue\nYeah, I be switching up the rhythm like the rhyme's a piece of chewing gum\nNow I might chew, but I don't bite\nMy ideas are mine when I begin to write\nIn my sleep I\u2019ll be thinking 'bout beats and\nGetting on the mic and busting some treats and\nSportin\u2019 the crazy funky threads that you've never even seen before\nWhat I\u2019m lackin\u2019 from the mackin\u2019 I can find at the thrift store\nI won't scuff nor scuffle, just grin as they walk by\nTake time to rhyme for a girl I hear talk fly\nDown some papaya, down with the revolution\nAlways wear my goggles, \u2018cause there's so much pollution\nI can do the Freak, the Patty Duke, and the Spank\nGotta free the funky fish from the funky fish tanks\nI\u2019ll sell my house, sell my car, and I\u2019ll sell all my stuff\n\"I\u2019m going back to New York City, I do believe I\u2019ve had enough\"\n\nWhipped-whipped-whipped cream\nWhipped-whipped-whipped cream\n\nWe're gonna\u2019 be out of her in a minute\nSo this one goes out to my man, Mario C\nMy brother Adrock, cuttin' it up on the turntable\nYeah, finger lickin'

the blackbyrds I'm a do it fluid\nBuilding rhymes like buildings, like a stonehenge druid\nStep up and get enlightened, educating my mind\nI play the tape forward, it's not time to rewind\n\n[MCA]\n\nStep inside the motherfucker and I get my flow on\nAmalgamating styles so I've got something to grow on\nSeasons change when it comes their time\nFall brings the winter (yeah) and on back to springtime\n\n[Ad-Rock]\n\nWell, it's the King Ad-Rock and that's who I am\nListen all of y'all I'm not the Son of Sam\nCause I'm thin and I don't grin\nBut check it out people cause I loves to go and swim\n\n[Mike D]\n\nCaught up on the phone, fiber optic distraction\nInformation super highway got the brain contraction\nI'm the Kung Fu master vs. The Sumo wrestler\nGot the beats in Manhattan you can hear in Westchester\n\n[MCA]\n\nWell, my mother was born out in Coney Island\nRaised on the LES, Manhattan Island\nMy dad came out from Detroit and they had me\nAnd then back through Ellis Island goes (yeah) the family tree\n\n[Ad-Rock]\n\nWell, I'm a six point seven on the Richter Scale\nI've got rhymes gallore and then I never fail\nLike gravy to potatoes, Luke to Darth Vader(s)\nI'm a souped-up sucker and I'll see you all later\n\n[Biz Markie]\n\nLet's do it, ahh, let's do it\nAhh, let's do it, do it, do it, do it\nAhh, let's do it, ahh, let's do it\nAhh, let's do it, do it, do it, do it\n\n[Mike D]\n\nYou see me comin' down the block with the funky cuts\nYou say, (\"Hey, Mike D\") and I say, \"Mic deez nuts\"\nI've got attractions like I'm Elvis Costello\nAdam Yauch you grab the mic cause you know you're my mellow\n\n[MCA]\n\nWell, when I get it into the zone\nI'm gonna take it to a place where I'm all alone\nWell when I got my shit ah-with my rhyme style's kicking\nMy brain is flowing honest like Abe Lincoln\n\n[Ad-Rock]\n\nCause I'm the fuckin' rhythm ace with the rhyme selection\nListen all y'all, I rap with perfection\nBecause I got the motherfuckin' old school flavor\nThat you savor, so watch your behavior\n\n[Mike D]\n\nTalking other dimensions, levels higher\nWhy did Billy Joel say, \"We Didn't Start the Fire\"\nTake you to another realm, ugh, another level\nI've got the funky rhymes but I'm not the funky devil\n\n[MCA]\n\nI step from minute to minute, lifetime to lifetime\nStep from stage to stage to see it all unwind\nSlowly but surely I seek to find my mind\nAnd every wall that I face is of my own design\n\n[Ad-Rock]\n\nYEAH Glendale Boulevard... ah boulevard\nGlendale Boulevard is where I'm at\nIt's where I'm at, where I live\nCheck it Check it out cause my head is like a sieve\nAnd yo we turn it out\n\n\n[Biz Markie]\n\nDo it, let's do it\nWith your mind, put your body into it\nLet's do it, let's do it\nWith your mind, put your

down we are all equal\nThere's no better or worse between you and me\nBut I rock the mic so viciously\nLike pins and needles and words that sting\nAt the blink of an eye I will do my thing\nIt's like a needle in the cartridge when the record spins\nLike diggin' down deep in the record bins\nEverybody gettin' down make no mistake\nNothing sounds quite like an 8...0...8\n\nMoney makin', money money makin (Manhattan!)\nSuper disco, disco breakin'\nMoney makin', money money makin (Manhattan!)\nSuper disco, disco breakin'\n\nSometimes I like to brag, sometimes I'm soft spoken\nWhen I'm in Holland I eat the pannenkoeken\nThe worm is the spice, you bring the sauce\nAnd you can kiss my ass you funky boss\nNow that you got what you want, you want more\nWell I'll be with the hammer and the nail at your door\nWith these funky beats I be goin' head huntin'\nShouts to my peeps let me know if you feel something\nCause I can give you all you need\nA little beat for the rhythm and some words to read\nLet me tell you now that's my favorite shit\n\"And when I got a new rhyme I just say...\"\nSo!\n\nMoney makin', money money makin (Manhattan!)\nSuper disco, disco breakin'\nMoney makin', money money makin (Manhattan!)\nSuper disco disco breakin'\n\n(\"Is Manhattan in the house?\n[Scratching \"uh-huh, uh-huh\"]\nIs Manhattan in the house?\n[Scratching \"uh-huh, uh-huh\"]\n[Scratching

the Benihana chef on the SP12\nI chop the fuck out the beats left on the shelf\nYou be like 'Hello Nasty, where you been?'\nIt's time you brought the grimy beats out the dungeon\n\n[Mike D]\nI jumped outside the house with my Walkman on\nI get so hyped when I hear this song\nIt's gonna keep me happy like all day long\nSo go and talk shit cause it just makes me strong\n\n[MCA]\nDon't grease my

kinds of shame in the game you got\nWe keep the party moving to the broad daylight\nG-E-T-L-I-V-E, alright\n\n[Mike D]\nTranshypnotic, robotic, can't stop it\nNo limits to this style and you know you can't lock it\nFirst you mock it, rock it and then you stock it\nBut I've got the styles that are always in the pocket\n\n[MCA]\nWell, like a bird floating down on a New York breeze\nEvery thought in the mind is a planted seed\nSo watch the mind or the thoughts will stack\nBefore you know it, boomeranging on back\n\n[Ad-Rock]\nWell I'm the king of Boggle, there is none higher\nI get eleven points off the word 'quagmire'\nFools can't see me, that's how it is\nAnd that's how I like it and that's my biz\n\n[Hook]\nBeatsie-Beatsie Boys gettin' live on the spot\nPuttin' all types of shame in the game you got\nWe keep the party moving to the broad day light\nG-e-t-l-i-v-e, alright\n\n[Mike D]\nTime's an illusion as the moments race by\nToo fast to really grasp, though we may try\nDeny 'til we die, ooh my-my\nThese thoughts that mislead and then multiply\n\n[MCA]\nWell, second by second and minute by minute\nIt's like lotto, you have to be in it to win it\nShakin' mind breakin' on their own demise\nLies tax to the max and they'll be feeling those vibes\n\n[Ad-Rock]\nSo tell me what you need that you have got\nFiending on power will make your blood clot\nIt starts with the greed and then goes all wrong\nThat's why, We can't all just get along\n\n[Mike D]\nWe're all connected like a Lego set\nOne equals one together like a croquette\nWhether we have or have not yet met\nWell, it ain't no thing and it ain't no sweat\n\n[Hook]\nBeatsie-Beatsie Boys gettin' live on the spot\nPuttin' all kinds of shame in the game you got\nWe keep the party moving to the broad daylight\nG-e-t-l-i-v-e, alright\n\n[Samples]\nNon-stop hip-hop, non-stop hip-hop\nNon-stop hip-hop, non-stop hip-hop\n\n[MCA]\nWell, you're caught in a panic and it's rattled your brain\nThe selfish ways just can't maintain\nBut these are the breaks when you try and come fake\nDon't come with the rhymes that you just half baked\n\n[Ad-Rock]\nWell I'm the Benihana chef on the SP12\nI chop the fuck out the beats left on the shelf\nYou be like 'Hello Nasty, where you been?'\nIt's time you brought the grimy beats out the dungeon\n\n[Mike D]\nI jumped outside the house with my Walkman on\nI get so hyped when I hear this song\nIt's gonna keep me happy like all day long\nSo go and talk shit cause it just makes me strong\n\n[MCA]\nDon't grease my palms with your filthy cash\nMultinationals spreading like a rash\nI might stick around or I might be a fad\nBut I won't sell my songs for no TV ad\n\n[Hook]\nBeatsie-Beatsie-Beatsie-Beatsie Boys gettin' live on the spot\nPuttin' all kinds of shame in the game you got\nWe keep the party moving to the broad day light\nG-e-t-l-i-v-e, alright\n\n[Samples]\nOur sound is the nicest, it's the sweetest sound\nOur sound is the nicest, it's the sweetest sound\nCan't get enough of that f-f-funk\nCan't get enough of that f-funk\nCan't get enough of that f-f-funk\nCan't get enough of that f-funk\n\nJunior..."}}, {"title": "3 the Hard Way", "album": "To the 5

emcee you must listen to\nPeople say that they been missin' me and missin' you\nGet on the mic and let's show them like we used to\nWell, you say fuck that, yo, Holmes, fuck this\nI'm the King AdWhammy and you're Dick Butkus\nOne half science and another half soul\nNicknamed Mike D, not Fat Morton Jelly Roll\nGot busy in 'Frisco, fooled around in Fresno\nGot over on your girlie cause you know she never says no\n\nSo just get on the mic, just get on the mic\nJust get on the mic, get on the mic, Mike!\n\nWell, Mike D, is a special individual\nPullin' out knots and pullin' in residuals\nGo to the movies, get the Rolos\nThe cholos ridin' slow and low\nMike on the mic and bust with the solo\nMike, my stromy, don't be so selfish\nGet on the mic cause you know you eat shellfish\n\n{At the fever}"}}, {"title": "Don't Play No Game That I Can't Win", "album": "Hot Sauce Committee Part 2", "year": "2011-04-27", "lyrics": "Uh, Beastie Boys, Santigold\nLet's do this, y'all\nSantigold\n\nLet's go!\n\nSantigold:\nIt's hot here, gotta say it's so\nI got you right where I want\nGot an honest face so you turn your back\nWhen in doubt, run up your attack\nAt one time you were slick and your grill was cold\nAnd now funny how the shit gets old\nYou can run, you can run, but it will catch up\nLike now, see me, I'll show you up\n\nNow you wanna get back when you had your shine\nBut you run the same thing every time when you rhyme\nCan't stop, won't stop, no compromise\nIt's a house of cards built out of lies\nComing down like a bird floating on the mist\nTurn on the track, back track, and twist\nYou work hard to climb the list\nTwenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift\n\nI know the danger of a man\nWho's been to hell and back again (danger)\nCan't tell tomorrow from where he's been (that's danger)\nDon't play no game that I can't win (danger)\n\nYou're caught now by the skin you're in\nIn a bind now, your thoughts go to all your sins\nHits much harder back, better count on that\nI tell you what we know always holds us back\nNow you mutter and you stutter and you putter don't stop\nI got in your heart and I shook you up\nIn a bind, now you're caught by the fear setting in\nChoked on the thought that you done it again\n\nI Keep the competition in check\nYou draft, your plans, at your drafting desk\nYou try to play to win but now you lost\nLike clams with no tartar sauce\nScheming in the attic\nThought you had it\nSo dramatic\nI got the stats, mathematics\nAutomatic, systematic\nShe's super bad now\nWhat'cha, what'cha want now?\n\nI know the danger of a man (that's danger)\nWho's been to hell and back again (danger)\nCan't tell tomorrow from where he's been (that's danger)\nDon't play no game that I can't win (danger)\nDon't play no game that I can't win (danger)\nDon't play no game that I can't win (that's danger)\nDon't play no game that I can't win (danger, danger)\nDon't play no game that I can't win (that's danger)\n\nI know the danger of a man (that's danger)\nWho's been to hell and back again (danger)\nCan't tell tomorrow from where he's been (that's danger)\nDon't play no game that I can't win (danger)\n\nDon't play no game that I can't win\nDon't play no game that I can't win", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/10a918d0f0dc052d8970fd4a82335cf5.500x500x1.jpg", "artist": "Beastie Boys",

go!\n\nSantigold:\nIt's hot here, gotta say it's so\nI got you right where I want\nGot an honest face so you turn your back\nWhen in doubt, run up your attack\nAt one time you were slick and your grill was cold\nAnd now funny how the shit gets old\nYou can run, you can run, but it will catch up\nLike now, see me, I'll show you up\n\nNow you wanna get back when you had your shine\nBut you run the same thing every time when you rhyme\nCan't stop, won't stop, no compromise\nIt's a house of cards built out of lies\nComing down like a bird floating on the mist\nTurn on the track, back track, and twist\nYou work hard to climb the list\nTwenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift\n\nI know the danger of a man\nWho's been to hell and back again (danger)\nCan't tell tomorrow from where he's been (that's danger)\nDon't play no game that I can't win (danger)\n\nYou're caught now by the skin you're in\nIn a bind now, your thoughts go to all your sins\nHits much harder back, better count on that\nI tell you what we know always holds us back\nNow you mutter and you stutter and you putter don't stop\nI got in your heart and I shook you up\nIn a bind, now you're caught by the fear setting in\nChoked on the thought that you done it again\n\nI Keep the competition in check\nYou draft, your plans, at your drafting desk\nYou try to play to win but now you lost\nLike clams with no tartar sauce\nScheming in the attic\nThought you had it\nSo dramatic\nI got the stats, mathematics\nAutomatic, systematic\nShe's super bad now\nWhat'cha, what'cha want now?\n\nI know the danger of a man (that's danger)\nWho's been to hell and back again (danger)\nCan't tell tomorrow from where he's been (that's danger)\nDon't play no game that I can't win (danger)\nDon't play no game that I can't win (danger)\nDon't play no game that I can't win (that's danger)\nDon't play no game that I can't win (danger, danger)\nDon't play no game that I can't win (that's danger)\n\nI know the danger of a man (that's danger)\nWho's been to hell and back again (danger)\nCan't tell tomorrow from where he's been (that's danger)\nDon't play no game that I can't win (danger)\n\nDon't play no game that I can't win\nDon't play no game that I can't win"}}, {"title": "Bodhisattva Vow", "album": "Ill Communication", "year": "1994-05-31", "lyrics": "[MCA]\n\nAs I develop the awakening mind\nI

in just one show\nWith the cornbread stuffin', with the Blimpie Bluffin\nMother fuckin' Yossi with his goddamn muffins\nHey could you please, pass me the peas\nAnd let me get a tissue if you think you're gonna sneeze\nI'm the player and the coach, I'm no roach\nI bought my grandma a brand new brooch\n\nWell I'm MCA with a story to tell\nWhen I rock the crowd, I rock the crowd well\nAnd when I

batten\nDown those hatches stop procrastin-\n\nWell I'm Mike D with a story to tell\nAnd when I rock the crowd, the crowd we all yell\nAnd when I get the feeling, I feel the feel swell\nCause when I start to rhyme, I rhyme the rhyme well\n\nWent to the top and never went pop and\nCame back down but still not stopping\nI'm not even asking, \"Yo, what's cracking?\"\nServing emcees on a platter like baked Alaskan\nSo start packin', cause I'm back in\nThe game of hip-hop representin' Manhattan\n\nNow push the pause button, then start ducking\nShhhhh, you heard me like I'm E.F. Hutton\nHutton shhhhhhhh, Hutton shhh, Hutton shhhhhhh\nHutton SHHHHHHHHH!!!\n\n\"And I was trying on the Batgirl costume, what's wrong with that?\nNow, now I was the Catwoman.\"\n\nHey, Adam.

Barnaby Jones?\nSombody say Columbo\nMickey Mulroney?\nIs it Cannon...\nBarnaby Jones?\nI said that already\n\nYeah that's right, ya'll\nYou know I got my own shit\nSee, this ain't America's Most Wanted\nThis is America's Most Mackin!\nThat's right other people all call it, my hit!\nWhen I get on there is no stoppin'!\nWho is this?\n\nWho is the man, who is the man, who is the man?\nWho is the man, who is the man, who is the man?\nWho is the man, who is the man?\n\nWho is the man?\nWho's that?\nThe maestro\nWho is the man?\nWhat?

this mic\nMC's be really workin' on what they write\nWith the sound delight we rock all night\nAnd yes we're gonna party for the right to fight\nWe're international like Matt Takei\nRock the mic from Munich out to Taipei\nStill around the way is where we'll stay\nSay what we mean, mean what we say\nTrajectories from the past are taking their toll\nAnd what we do now is future molding\nColumbine bowling, childhood stolen\nWe need a bit more gun controlling\n\nRight-Right-Now-Now; What is going on?\nWe-We-Gotta-Gotta; Get it goin' on\nBe-Be-Fore-Fore; It's too far gone\nWe gotta work together it's been too long\n\nWhen I get on you scream, \"HOO TIGHT!\"\nRockin' this flow I could go all night\nI'm not here to fight, or incite\nI'm like the beach in the Bahamas make you feel alright\nI'm getting kind of tired of the situation\nThe U.S. attacking other nations\nAnd narration, on every station\nFalse elation's got me losing my patience\nI'm a funky-ass Jew and I'm on my way\nAnd yes I got to say fuck the KKK\nAnd oh yeah hey, how about today?\nIf you want to set if off then let me hear you say\n\nRight-Right-Now-Now; What is going on?\nWe-We-Gotta-Gotta; Get it goin' on\nBe-Be-Fore-Fore; It's too far gone\nWe gotta work together it's been too long\n\nI went to get a loan and they asked my race\nI wrote down human inside the space\nIt's a disgrace how they try to debase\nIt ain't the banks damn business how my lineage trace\nNow let me drop a verse that's terse and concise\nI'm an iron chef when I slice and dice\nWith the rhyme precise, the word is nice\nSo please pass me the Riunite on ice\nWell let's go to work and not get berserk\nCause when the time comes the body goes to dirt\nTry to smooth it out like Levert\nKeep the mind on alert and not revert\n\nRight-Right-Now-Now; What is going on?\nWe-We-Gotta-Gotta; Get it goin' on\nBe-Be-Fore-Fore; It's too far gone\nWe gotta work together it's been too long", "image":

write\nWith the sound delight we rock all night\nAnd yes we're gonna party for the right to fight\nWe're international like Matt Takei\nRock the mic from Munich out to Taipei\nStill around the way is where we'll stay\nSay what we mean, mean what we say\nTrajectories from the past are taking their toll\nAnd what we do now is future molding\nColumbine bowling, childhood stolen\nWe need a bit more gun controlling\n\nRight-Right-Now-Now; What is going on?\nWe-We-Gotta-Gotta; Get it goin' on\nBe-Be-Fore-Fore; It's too far gone\nWe gotta work together it's been too long\n\nWhen I get on you scream, \"HOO TIGHT!\"\nRockin' this flow I could go all night\nI'm not here to fight, or incite\nI'm like the beach in the Bahamas make you feel alright\nI'm getting kind of tired of the situation\nThe U.S. attacking other nations\nAnd narration, on every station\nFalse elation's got me losing my patience\nI'm a funky-ass Jew and I'm on my way\nAnd yes I got to say fuck the KKK\nAnd oh yeah hey, how about today?\nIf you want to set if off then let me hear you say\n\nRight-Right-Now-Now; What is going on?\nWe-We-Gotta-Gotta; Get it goin' on\nBe-Be-Fore-Fore; It's too far gone\nWe gotta work together it's been too long\n\nI went to get a loan and they asked my race\nI wrote down human inside the space\nIt's a disgrace how they try to debase\nIt ain't the banks damn business how my lineage trace\nNow let me drop a verse that's terse and concise\nI'm an iron chef when I slice and dice\nWith the rhyme precise, the word is nice\nSo please pass me the Riunite on ice\nWell let's go to work and not get berserk\nCause when the time comes the body goes to dirt\nTry to smooth it out like Levert\nKeep the mind on alert and not revert\n\nRight-Right-Now-Now; What is going on?\nWe-We-Gotta-Gotta; Get it goin' on\nBe-Be-Fore-Fore; It's too far gone\nWe gotta work together it's been too long"}}, {"title": "Alright Hear This", "album": "Ill Communication", "year":

something\nDon't try it at home with your dad's stereo\nOnly under hip-hop supervision, alright?}\n\n{Alright hear this\nSo you wanna be an MC, huh?\nAlright hear this\nSo you wanna be an MC, huh?}\n\nBecause I grab the microphone and I pick it up\nAnd then I fuck it up and then I turn it in\nAnd then I turn it out, got the body rockin' sound\nAnd then you know I\u2019m gonna get down\n\nEat a Scooby snack and take disco nap\nBecause I\u2019m shopping at Sears, cause I don't buy at the Gap\nSending this one out to all the funky inspirations\nPretty Purdie on the drums with the beat relations\n\nWell, I\u2019m working on rhymes, they're coming line by line\nTrying to put what I feel into word and rhymes\nI've got a feeling coming on, I\u2019ve got to make some shit\nA little something stupid, for the twisted and sick\n\nBecause I drive like a maniac on the streets\nAnd I don't give a fuck cause I\u2019ve got the beats\nGot my nuts swingin' from left to right and\nRight to left and I\u2019m death defying\n\n{Alright hear this\nSo you wanna be an MC, huh?\nAlright hear this\nSo you wanna be an MC, huh?}\n\nI spin my fortune on a wheel like Sajak\nHere's \"The Payback;\" Keep going strong, like since the way-back\nI try to be myself but I lose track\nBecause the shit gets complicated, now I\u2019ve got to get back\n\nAs we learn to breed love for one another\nIn these times of melding cultures\nI give respect for what's been borrowed and lent\nI know this music comes down from African descent\n\nBecause I don't need a magic potion\nLet me talk about backfield in motion\nMy girls got cheeks for weeks and I\u2019m happy\nYou know I\u2019m a sneak like my old grand pappy\n\nWell I gotta give thanks to my man, Archie Shepp\nFor staying true to inspiration and I don't half step\nSo I kick out the jams and tell you who I am\nAnd I talk to the people like Les McCann\n\n{Alright hear this\nSo you wanna be an MC, huh?\nAlright hear this\nSo you wanna be an MC, huh?\nAlright hear this\nAlright hear this}\n\nI ask God for a rhyme or two\nA little somethin' for the wise as well as the fool\nA little somethin' to effect a little taste of change\nFor the together and strong as well as the deranged\n\nI'll do you right like Bobby Knight\nAnd then I\u2019m rappin\u2019 on the mic to the Broadway light\nStomp my hands, I clap my feet and\nI'm buggin' off Yusef Lateef\n\nI got a match to my ass and I\u2019ma keep it lit\nAnd well I need to get some cash, call my accountant Britt\nI'm rushin' around town takin' care of my functions\nAlways got one more thing so forget about function\n\nWe create this world and the problems go on\nCreate our lives and the things that go wrong\nSo to the deaf, the blind look around and listen\nTo what it is you want and for what you're wishin'\n\n{Alright hear this\nOh yeah\nSo you wanna be an MC, huh?\nAlright hear this\nSo you wanna be an MC, huh?\nAlright hear this}", "image":

against the needle\nBack and forth, back and forth, makin' it scratch\nBut let me tell you something\nDon't try it at home with your dad's stereo\nOnly under hip-hop supervision, alright?}\n\n{Alright hear this\nSo you wanna be an MC, huh?\nAlright hear this\nSo you wanna be an MC, huh?}\n\nBecause I grab the microphone and I pick it up\nAnd then I fuck it up and then I turn it in\nAnd then I turn it out, got the body rockin' sound\nAnd then you know I\u2019m gonna get down\n\nEat a Scooby snack and take disco nap\nBecause I\u2019m shopping at Sears, cause I don't buy at the Gap\nSending this one out to all the funky inspirations\nPretty Purdie on the drums with the beat relations\n\nWell, I\u2019m working on rhymes, they're coming line by line\nTrying to put what I feel into word and rhymes\nI've got a feeling coming on, I\u2019ve got to make some shit\nA little something stupid, for the twisted and sick\n\nBecause I drive like a maniac on the streets\nAnd I don't give a fuck cause I\u2019ve got the beats\nGot my nuts swingin' from left to right and\nRight to left and I\u2019m death defying\n\n{Alright hear this\nSo you wanna be an MC, huh?\nAlright hear this\nSo you wanna be an MC, huh?}\n\nI spin my fortune on a wheel like Sajak\nHere's \"The Payback;\" Keep going strong, like since the way-back\nI try to be myself but I lose track\nBecause the shit gets complicated, now I\u2019ve got to get back\n\nAs we learn to breed love for one another\nIn these times of melding cultures\nI give respect for what's been borrowed and lent\nI know this music comes down from African descent\n\nBecause I don't need a magic potion\nLet me talk about backfield in motion\nMy girls got cheeks for weeks and I\u2019m happy\nYou know I\u2019m a sneak like my old grand pappy\n\nWell I gotta give thanks to my man, Archie Shepp\nFor staying true to inspiration and I don't half step\nSo I kick out the jams and tell you who I am\nAnd I talk to the people like Les McCann\n\n{Alright hear this\nSo you wanna be an MC, huh?\nAlright hear this\nSo you wanna be an MC, huh?\nAlright hear this\nAlright hear this}\n\nI ask God for a rhyme or two\nA little somethin' for the wise as well as the fool\nA little somethin' to effect a little taste of change\nFor the together and strong as well as the deranged\n\nI'll do you right like Bobby Knight\nAnd then I\u2019m rappin\u2019 on the mic to the Broadway light\nStomp my hands, I clap my feet and\nI'm buggin' off Yusef Lateef\n\nI got a match to my ass and I\u2019ma keep it lit\nAnd well I need to get some cash, call my accountant Britt\nI'm rushin' around town takin' care of my functions\nAlways got one more thing so forget about function\n\nWe create this world and the problems go on\nCreate our lives and the things that go wrong\nSo to the deaf, the blind look around and listen\nTo what it is you want and for what you're wishin'\n\n{Alright hear this\nOh yeah\nSo you wanna be an MC, huh?\nAlright hear

up\nWell\n\n[Verse 1]\nThings get hectic quick\nFrom the satellite dish to your joy stick\nIt's the night of the living cable box\nWires coming up from around the block\nRemote control to change the station\nBut that won't change your situation\nHave you seen what I mean\nI'm the little gnome that's in your dreams\nSo I say this rhyme built by design\nTo take you beyond space and time\nSaid who is the man making diamonds out of coal\nThe man pushing buttons on remote control\n\n[Hook]\nRe-mote, control\nRemote control\n\n[Verse 2]\nUntil your back's up against the wall\nYou never know yourself that much at all\nSo you've got to share your love with a friend\nThat's all that you've got left in the end\nLiving in this city of pure confusion\nPeople mislead by their own illusion\nAll this action, no satisfaction\nWe're all linked together like a chain reaction\nPlay or fold, love is bold\nWhat is the future that will unfold?\nSome like it hot, others like it cold\nBut we all want to hold the remote control\n\n[Hook]\nRe-mote, control\nRe-mote, control\nRe-mote, control\nRe-mote, control\n\n[Verse 3]\nThings get hectic quick\nAll of the sudden I'm in the thick\nToo much drama all around\nDistractions booming in sensurround\nLike a rainy day's Earth it won't sit still\nSliding on down a hill\nSometimes life seems to stall\nSo never be ungrateful y'all\nSo I got a little something for your pay per view\nLike Don King, I've got the crazy hair do\nWe've got cameras on Mars on space patrol\nControlled on Earth by remote control", "image":

know me well\nWe be kickin' bass, all up in your face\nAnd when it comes to beats, well, I'm the rhythm ace\n\nNow if you check my pulse, it beats skull snaps\nI keep all my rhymes in my Le Sportsac\nSo what if I'm a ham and cheese on rye?\nI got to do my thing and that's no lie\n\nWell, ice is cold and fire is hot\nWhen it comes to competition, we've got them locked\nU-N-I-T-E\nA little shout to Ian and little Zoe\n\nOne can wonder why, but can't deny\nIf we could work it out, it would be so fly\nWe'll never know unless we try\nSo tell me, party people, what's your Zodiac sign?\n\nBreakdancers of the world, unite!\n\"Oh shit\u2026 yeah\"\n\nBboys of the world, unite!\n\"Well wicked\"\n\nI went inside the deli, and my man's like, what?\nI write the songs that make the whole world suck\nI need to break it down every chance I get\nSo, Ssshhh, we keep it raw on the set\n\nAutomation, circulation\nThis is for the people all around the nations\nI got books with hooks, and it looks like rain\nWould someone on the Knicks please drive the lane?\n\nNow rhymes are mantequilla on a track by us\nI've got to keep my mind clear so I don't bust\nIf you got bad breath, then maybe try Scope\nAnd if you wash your ass, you best use soap\n\nPeople of the world, you realize\nWe got to get together and harmonize\nI feel I'm comin down with the boogaloo flu\n\"Explain to me really what doctors must do\"\n\nRavers of the world, unite!\nCome on now\n\nWe're the scientists of sound\nWe're mathematically puttin' it down\nWhen lightning strikes, best grab a ground\nGot to get up to get down\n\nI've got the terminator style with a touch of the tweak\nTechnics 1200's, I'm known to freak\nI don't like to fight, I don't carry a piece\nI wear permanent press so I'm always creased\n\nMike D with the rump shakin' action\nDo it like this for the intergalaction\nI practice asana daily so I'm very flexible\nI'm a Scorpio so you know I'm very sexual\n\nShouts to Rach and my brother Matthew\nIn Money-Makin', it's how we do\nI be smokin' roaches in the vestibule\nIn the next millennium, I'll still be old school\n\nHigh roller, big baller\nI call 'em crullers but you know they're called crawlers\nI keep it movin' to the broad daylight\nBgirls of the world, unite! (a'ight!)\n\nKeep it on and on, keep it on and on\nKeep it on and on, keep it on and on\nKeep it on and on, keep it on and on\nKeep it on and on, keep it on and on\nKeep it on and on, keep it on and

Respected\nBeen Far From Too Long That She's Been Neglected\nRace Against Race, Such A Foolish Waste\nIt's Like Cutting Off Your Nose To Spite Your Face\nAnd At The End Of The Wars, What Was The Cost\nIt's Clear That The Earth Was The One Who Lost\nWe Are One With Her As She Is One With Us\nIt's Unreal How She Is Treated So Unjust\nAs Our Planet Grows Smaller Each And Every Day\nEveryone Affecting Everyone In Every Way\nWe're All Citizens Of The World Community\nAll Here Together And We're Searching For Unity\nOver The Years, I've Grown And Changed So Much\nThings I Know Now Years Ago, I Couldn't Touch\nThere Are Things I've Done That I Wouldn't Do Again\nBut I'm Glad That I Did 'Cause I've Learned From Them\nI Just Try To Stay Present Right Here, Right Now\nNo Worries, No Fears And Without Any Doubts\nIt's About Time\n'Cause In These Times, These Changing Times\nA Transition Is Occuring And I Am Not Blind\nAs The Pendlum Swings A New Age We Enter\nAnd With Every Swing, It Draws Closer To The Center\nYes The Storm Before The Calm And The Wars That Lead To Love\nThings Must Run Their Course So We Push And We Shove\nBut We're Here To Work It Out In One Way Or Another\nTo Find A Mutual Respect For Ourselves And One Another\nAnd The True Key Is A Trust In Self\nFor When I Trust Myself, I Fear No One Else\nI Took Control Of My Life, Just As Anyone Can\nI Want Everyone To See It's In The Palm Of Your Hand\nThe Past Is Gone, The Future Yet Unborn\nBut Right Here And Now Is Where It All Goes On\nI Know We Can Fix It And It's Not Too Late\nI Give Respect To King And His Nonviolent Ways\nI Dream And I Hope And I Won't Forget\nSomeday I'm Going To Visit On A Free Tibet\nSomeday I'm Going To See Us All Joined As One\nAnd It Would Be Too Bad To Blow It Up Before We're Done\n'Cause We Long Behind The Rage Learning From The Pain\nThe Love Behind The Tension Like The Sun Behind The Rain\nI'm Sending Loving Light To All That Is\nTo All Creation And The Life We Live\nI'm Not Preaching Bull Shit, Just Speaking My Mind\n'Cause I'm Here Now And It's About Time\n\"When Two Are Served, You May Begin To Eat\"\nGene Futterman\nBecause I Grab The Microphone And I Pick It Up\nAnd Then I F*ck It Up And Then I Turn It In\nAnd Then I Turn It Out, Got The Body Rockin' Sound\nAnd Then You Know I'm Gonna Get Down And\nEat A Scooby Snack And Take Disco

Drive Like A Maniac On The Streets\nAnd I Don't Give F*ck 'Cause I've Got The Beats\nGot My Nuts Swingin' From Left To Right And\nRight To Left And I'm Death Defying\nAlright Hear This\nAlright Hear This\nI Spin My Fortune On A Wheel Like Sajak\nHere's The Payback Keep Going Strong Like Since The Way Back\nI Try To Be Myself But I Lose Track\n'Cause The Shit Gets Complicated Now I've Got To Get Back\nAs We Learn To Breed Love For One Another\nIn These Times Of Melying Cultures\nI Give Respect For What's Been Borrowed And Lent\nI Know This Music Comes Down From African Descent\nBecause I Don't Need A Magic Potion\nLet Me Talk About Back Field In Motion\nMy Girls Got Cheeks For Weeks And I'm Happy\nYou Know I'm A Sneak Like My Old Grand Pappy\nI Gotta Give Thanks To My Man Archie Shep\nFor Staying True To Inspiration And I Don't Half Step\nSo I Kick Out The Jams And Tell You Who I Am\nAnd I Talk To The People Like Les Mccann\nI Ask God For A Rhyme Or Two\nA Little Something For The Wise As Well As The Fool\nA Little Something To Affect A Little Taste Of Change\nFor The Together And The Strong As Well As the Dearanged\nI'll Do You Right Like Bobby Knight\nAnd Then I'm Rapping On The Mic To The Broadway Light\nStomp My Hands, I Clap My Feet And\nI'm Bugging Off Yusef Lateef\nI Got A Match To My Ass And I'm A Keep It Lit\nI Need To Get Some Cash, Call My Accountant Britt\nI'm Rushing Around Town Taking Care Of My Functions\nAlways Got One More Thing So Forget About Function\nWe Create This World And The Problems Go On\nCreate Our Lives And The Things That Go Wrong\nSo To The Deaf, The Blind, Look Around And Listen\nTo What It Is You Want And For What You're Wishing\n[Instrumental]\nMoon Me!\nSo, Just Sit Back And Max And Relax\nOff Tracks That I Kick, Come On And Give It Up\n'CauseI Get Funky Like Diaper Rash\nAnd You Know I'm Mad Spunky And I'm Making Cash\nI've Got Sex Rhymes Like Victoria's Got Secrets\nTo All You Porne Peepers Who Are Trying To Peep This\nI'm Like Al Goldstein, I'm All About Screwing\nLead My Team To Sixty Wins Like My Man Pat Ewing\nLike Getting Shot Out The Barrel Of A Wave\nLike Virgin Pow On The Peaks Of A.K\nLike A Sound That To The Depths Of The Soul\nWell That's The Feeling That I Make My Goal\nA Little Wine With My Dinner So I'm In The Grape Ape\nI Feel Like A Winner When I Make A Mix Tape\nBecause I Get Ill When I'm On The Pause Button\nAnd I Get My Fill And You Can't Say Nothing\nMore Soul On This Train Then Don Cornelious\nGot The Mad Subwoofer Pumping Bass For Your Anus\nJust Getting On The Mic At The Monthly Function\nWires Hitting Switches Connecting At The Junction\nPerlman's Got Beats And It Ain't No Secret\nDante Found His Shit But You Know He Freaked It\nAnd So The Story Goes On And On\nDown

Praise And Respect The Good They've Done\nKnowing Only Love Can Conquer In Every Situation\nWe Need Other People In Order To Create\nThe Circumstances For The Learning That We're Here To Generate\nSituations That Bring Up Our Deepest Fears\nSo We Can Work To Release Them Until They're Cleared\nTherefore, It Only Makes Sense\nTo Thank Our Enemies Despite Their Intent\nThe Bodhisattva Path Is One Of Power And Strength\nA Strength From Within To Go The Length\nSeeing Others Are As Important As Myself\nI Strive For A Happiness Of Mental Wealth\nWith The Interconnectedness That We Share As One\nEvery Action That We Take Affects Everyone\nSo In Deciding For What A Situation Calls\nThere Is A Path For The Good For All\nI Try To Make My Every Action For That Highest Good\nWith The Altruistic Wish To Achive Buddhahood\nSo I Pledge Here Before Everyone Who's Listening\nTo Try To Make My Every Action For The Good Of All Beings\nFor The Rest Of My Lifetimes And Even Beyond\nI Vow To Do My Best To Do No Harm\nAnd In Times Of Doubt I Can Think On The Dharma\nAnd The Enlightened Ones Who've Graduated Samsara\n[Instrumental]", "image":

we play in the neighborhood\n\nHow you feeling, MCA?\nWell, I feel right\nI speak my words on the track cause the track sounds tight\n\nWell, if you're feeling good and you're feeling right\nUh, somebody step up and grab the mic\n\n[Verse 1: Ad-Rock]\nNow hello everybody and how you been?\nIt's Ad-Rock rappin' on the microphone again\nI got grace, class, style, finesse, and debonair\nMurdalize motherfuckers cause I just don't care\nThe Emcee Whisperer, kinda like a trainer\nI take sucker rappers, I put 'em through a strainer\nLike macaroni cause the shit sound cheesy\nWatch how it's done, boy, it looks easy\nThe non-stop, goin' off, kingpin, microphone boss\nDo my own thing, you can't afford the cost\nOf my style, take you through a turnstile\nCause I'm live and direct, and I'm wicked and wild\nBecause I'm back on a roll, got total control\nI flow like the water out your toilet bowl\nYour style is cheap, boy, just like a Dutch\nYou know you're not smokin' on the microphone much\nThere's a certain special talent that I never lack\nHuh-ha, huh-ha, and that's a fact\nCause we shine like the chrome on a Cadillac\nYou better break a wishbone cause we never wack\nSaid we're never that and that is that\nAnd we're the nonstop disco powerpack!\nUh, that's right, we go all night\nWho gonna be next to bless the mic?\n\n[Interlude: All]\nNow this is the way we run it down\nWe're gettin' you high on the funky sound\nThis is the way we get it on\nB-Boys in the house 'til the break of dawn\n\n[Verse 2: Mike D]\nSee, I mix my style up like a cement mixer\nSmooth and fix ya, like a rhyme elixir\nI said, \"Yo, sound man, make Mike's mic louder\"\nDon't make me sound cheap like a box of douche powder\nI max and relax, champagne mojito\nDon't go commando, don't know bandito\nJe m'appelle Michel P\u00e9rignon\nMe and Claude in the chateau and we got it going on\nQuincy's in the hot tub like it's '73\nLooking over his shoulder and he's looking at me\nI'm all white in the face, towel around my waist\nWhat's up with that watch inside that glass case?\nI go to make my move, sneak out of the place\nUndetected, not leaving a trace\nParty's done, microphone's wrecked\nWine's been drunk and heads been checked\nI see one last profiterole and make my play\nAnd pass the microphone to MCA\n\n[Verse 3: MCA]\nNonstop, on the top, and you clock, when we rock\nNever fakin', no mistakin', we be makin' hip hop\n(So c'mon everybody get down... yeah)\n\nNow there's a spot check, hit the deck count down\nCause I'm a break it down for you, how we run it down\nPound for pound, keep the bass lines round\nI seen you watchin', clockin', jockin' my sound\nBut, for real, I'm real glad I grew up in hip hop\nStill got mad love for a record called \"Beat Bop\"\nIt meant a lot spinning on my Walkman\nShout out to the African Bam\nAnd to the S to the P the double O-N-Y\nThe one MC who you can't deny\nI'd listen to the records and they'd inspire\nSit down to write and the pen breathes fire\nConstruct a rhyme with specific intent\nFlowin' from the brain cells, right through the pen\nAnd then I put the book down, grab ahold the mic\nWords flowin' so cold, turn water to ice\nCome through the wire, saturate the tape\nYou put me in the mix, nice it up with the plate\nAnd then they press it on wax, sell it in the store\nThe DJ spin the record out on

easier to sit back than stick out your neck\nIt's easier to break things than build it correct\n\nWe've got a president we didn't elect\nThe Kyoto treaty he decided to neglect\nAnd still the US just

is on deck\nWhen it's time to wreck shop then shop I'll wreck\nSo let's calibrate and check our specs\nWe need a little shift on over towards the left\n\nI don't really know but I suspect\nI think it's due time that we inspect\nHow they get their information and their facts are checked?\nAnother press conference someone's talking out their neck\n\nIt takes a second to wreck it\nIt takes time to

Tex\nAnd the military muscle that he wants to flex\n\nBy the time Bush is done what will be left\nSelling votes like E-pills at the discotheque\nEnvironmental destruction and the national debt\nBut plenty of dollars left in the fat war chest\n\nWhat the real deal, why you can't connect?\nWhy you hating people that you never met?\nDidn't your mama teach you to show some respect?\nWhy not open your mind for a sec?\n\nIt takes a second to wreck it\nIt takes time to build\nIt takes a second to wreck it\nIt takes time to build\nYou gots to chill\n\nIt takes\nIt takes\nIt takes\nIt takes\nIt

up, wait up, you know, we come correct\nYou wanna change things up, well, hey, then get set\nIt's easier to sit back than stick out your neck\nIt's easier to break things than build it correct\n\nWe've got a president we didn't elect\nThe Kyoto treaty he decided to neglect\nAnd still the US just wants to flex\nKeep doin' that, what, we gonna break our necks\n\nIt takes a second to wreck it\nIt takes time to build\nIt takes a second to wreck it\nIt takes time to build\nYou gots to chill\n\nAh, yo, hate-filled people wanna keep us in check\nTearin' down each other is what they expect\nIf you want love, well, hey, that's a bet\nWe've got to give before we can get\n\nWaiting like a batter who is on deck\nWhen it's time to wreck shop then shop I'll wreck\nSo let's calibrate and check our specs\nWe need a little shift on over towards the left\n\nI don't really know but I suspect\nI think it's due time that we inspect\nHow they get their information and their facts are checked?\nAnother press conference someone's talking out their neck\n\nIt takes a second to wreck it\nIt takes time to build\nIt takes a second to wreck it\nIt takes time to build\nYou gots to chill\n\nSo step up to the window and place your bets\nIs the US gonna keep breaking necks\nMaybe it's time that we impeach Tex\nAnd the military muscle that he wants to flex\n\nBy the time Bush is done what will be left\nSelling votes like E-pills at the discotheque\nEnvironmental destruction and the national debt\nBut plenty of dollars left in the fat war chest\n\nWhat the real deal, why you can't connect?\nWhy you hating people that you never met?\nDidn't your mama teach you to show some respect?\nWhy not open your mind for a sec?\n\nIt takes a second to wreck it\nIt takes time to build\nIt takes a second to wreck it\nIt takes time to build\nYou gots to chill\n\nIt takes\nIt takes\nIt takes\nIt takes\nIt takes\nIt takes\n\n{The idea is to keep the green alien landing craft from taking your humans from the ground and changing them into mutants\nA mutant is very dangerous to you because he flies faster than you do and shoots at you}"}}, {"title": "Sneakin' Out the Hospital",

lederhosen\nLike Walt Disney he'll be frozen\nAnd then the Swiss Hall of Fame, he goes in\nCause when he's out in space carousin'\nPick up my mic and start joustin'\nMy name plate medallion\nSays never trust a Hal 9000\n\nWell, can't, won't, don't stop rockin' to the rhythm\nCause I get down, cause I get down\nCause I get down, get down, get down, get down, get down\n\nCheck the horizontal hold and check the tint\nAre these three fools back at it again?\nInspector Clouseau and Derek Flint\nNothin' but sparks ignitin'\nCheck two, one-two, mic testin'\nThis one goes out to Dechen\nRise fallen fighters, take your stance again\nDon't think too much about the color of skin\nOrder in vegetarian shark's fin\nTry to keep my life nonviolent\nMario, rewind the tape and \"Punch 'em in!\"\nLike Chuck D with the where you never been, I'm in\n\nWell, can't, won't, don't stop rockin' to the rhythm\nCause I get down, cause I get down\nCan't, won't, don't stop rockin' to the rhythm\nCause I get down, cause I get down\n\nI'm a long way from where I've been but I gotta keep moving, movin' on\n\nOh, my-my, I'm really not feelin' it\nOh, my-my, something's really wrong\nOh, my-my, I'm really not feelin' it\nOh, my-my, something's really wrong\n\nThe PA sound is deafenin'\nBitin' MCs, I'm oustenin'\nWith spinach in your teeth, you're grinnin'\nSo on your way out, please take a mint\nGot the studio to throw a craze in\nThe basslines Yauch just lays in\nThis song is the grass you're grazin'\nAdd a little flange and phase in\nDon't get mad cause I'm beguilin'\nI'm off the hook, so don't bother dialin'\nThey're gonna put me in the b-i-n\nAnd if I die, notify the next of kin\n\nCan't, won't, don't stop, can't, won't, don't stop\nCan't, won't, don't stop, can't,

blowing up like plutonium\n\nWhat's all the fanfare, what's the to do\nWe're known to bring the hullabaloo\nOn stage or at the spa\nGuaranteed we bring the brouhaha\n\u2018Cause it's a brouhaha\n\u2018Cause it's a brouhaha\n\nThere's a commotion that's goin' down\nI talk more shit than drown the clown\nI'm like that freak from Cirque du Soleil\nWith my leg behind my head and a rhyme to say\n\nTen nine eight seven six five four\nGet upon the mic and I'm a even the score\nOne two three, three to two one\nDon't carry a knife and I don't carry a gun\n\nYo, we be making mountains out of Cool Whip\nPass me the mint for the julep\nTell me everybody where is the love\nHey yo what's the motherfuckin' hubbub\n\u2018Cause it's a brouhaha\n\u2018Cause it's a brouhaha\n\nCommunicator check one two one two\nThis is Bones McCoy on a line to Sulu\nSet the bullshit to warp factor one\nCheck your tri-corder set your phaser to stun\n\nOh mai oui you can catch me\nAt Jon Vie with a pastry\nC'est ci c'est la oh n'est pas\nQu'est-ce-que c'est le brouhahaha\nHa haha haha!\n\nJust back from Japan and ooh I'm laggin'\nGoin' rao rao with the dungeon dragon\nYou can dance if you want to leave your friends behind\nBut if they don't dance and then they won't dance\nThey can kiss my fuckin' ass\n\u2018Cause it's a brouhaha\n\u2018Cause it's a brouhaha"}}, {"title": "5-Piece Chicken

comes to keep it real, I keep it really wrong\n\nAt the risk of sounding crass, I would like to mention\nThat I am well aware of your wack intentions\nTo usurp my prose you so-and-so\nIt's my primary bone of contention\n\nI tell you, everybody, I've had it\nWith all these people with static\nI'll go insane if it don't rain\nSucker MCs are problematic\n\nI love it when you hit those switches\nA curve ball's what my pitch is\nSo here we\u2014here we come\nLike dum-ditty-dum\nI keep all five boroughs in stitches\n\n\"You're right, man\"\n\nSound, sound, sound, sound, sound, sound\nSound, sounds sweeter through the echoplex\nIt'll spin you around and throw you in a hex\nUntil you feel no pain inside your brain\nAll your worries are soothed by the sound effects\n\nRead it in the Post and the Daily News\nListen everybody lets show improve\nDon't let me begin about heroin\nLiving six feet deep just ain't the move\n\nWe're giving you soul power\nI like it sweet and sour\nWhen it comes to rhymes and beat designs\nI'm at the control tower\n\nTell me what makes you so afraid\nOf all these people you say you hate\nJust give it one time for your mind\nAnd let's try to negotiate\nC'mon, let's try to negotiate\nLet's try to negotiate\n\n\"Bet you're wondering what's been going on\nBet you think I've almost lost my mind\nBet you think I've almost lost my mind\"",

when you coming home?\"\nWhen you comin' home?\nIt's a gift, it's a curse, it's the telephone\n\n[Ad-Rock]\nNow let's start over with a nice clean slate\nPlease stop stressing with the hurry-up-wait\nHeard you the first time, that sounds great\nBut back up out my space, ok?\n\n(Yeah-yeah, right-right) ok\nOk\nOk\nOk\nOk\n\n[Mike D]\nWrapped in pink ribbon, so pretty\nMy name's Mike D from New York City\nI guess it's all in the mind\nWhat I leave behind\n\n[Ad-Rock]\nThought you'd be smooth like a nice Nutter Butter\nBut I start to cringe, every word that you utter\nYes, you said you are a big deal\nBut, money, calm down, for real\n\n[MCA]\nGot to control my mind\nGot to slow down, rewind\nWhat is going on in my head?\nWhy's the sky gone red?\n\nWhat is going on in my head?\nWhy's the sky gone red?\nWhat is going on in my head?\n\nWhat is going on in my head?\nWhy's the sky gone red?\nWhat is going on in my head?\nWhy's the sky gone red?\n\nWhat is going on in my head?\nWhat is going on in my head?\n\n[Ad-Rock]\nNow I don't give a fuck who the hell you are\nPlease stop shouting in your cellular\nI never asked to be part of your day\nSo please stop shouting in your phone, ok?\n\n[MCA]\nYou lie like a plainclothes cop\nTake a minute, take a look, and take stock\nTake a minute, get your mind unlocked\nGet open and I'll throw you the rock\n\n[Mike D]\nWhat's going on in my head?\nAnd why has the sky gone all red?\nBe kind, rewind\nAt least tell me what it is I did\nOr just say what should I say\nHmm... ok?\n\n(Yeah-yeah, right-right)

(yeah)\nAnd then you're out talking shit like Yosemite Sam\nYou've got the elephant feet like Les McCan\n\nUp the crack of dawn, I'm on my way\nWe're talking two foot dump and there'll be no delay\nCause I'm gone, the shit's getting out of hand\nI'm changing my middle name to first Trem\n\nI'm walking on the rhythm like Philippe Petite\nI've got holes in my mouth where my teeth should be\nYou ask, Whatever happenened to the rappin' duke?\nI heard the Captain's gonna sign him to Jive and that's the truth\n\nTaking care of my functions, still smokin' up the shrubery\nI stopped eating chicken cause the shit was too rubbery\nMy produce, organic, from my own yard\nOnly the freshest herbs and growing's not too hard\n\nVibes, vibrations\nVibes, vibrations\n\nDreaming on it, screaming on it, ready to get dumb\nWaking up my long joint, ready to get some\nLooking at my board and my old boots\nSeeing a waist deep champagne moment of truth\n\nAnd on the court I've got game like my brother Matt\nI give a shout out -- so where you at?\nBut don't get souped, Matthew, cause I'm-a take ya\nHoratio Park right now and I'm-a shake ya\n\nGive me the fresh count, you know that I'm stressed out\nI need some inspiration, so get the best out\nLike Rock Master Scott, I'm on the request line\nWriting the fresh rhyme, having the best time\n\nGood vibes flowing all around\nNot a worry in mind as the friends around\nA shout out to Linda, riding pow forever\nWell the 'Bird is the word and you're as light as a feather'\n\nWell I smoke a bag of rat weed cause I don't care\nAnd I'm waxing old ladies out of their underwears\nI like the boomin' grannies in big old panties\nI'm giving it to grandma, making her crazy\n\nI might be a white boy, but I'm no goofy\nGot beats like Babalu on \"I Love Lucy\"\nI'm not like the Skipper on \"Fantasy Island\"\nI'm more like Captain Stubing when I go buck whylin'\n\nThe Cire Traverse out to Death shoot\nOr STH when they let me back at the Deuce\nCause I can't get enough of that funky stuff\nWhen the going gets rough, ain't going out in the sluff\n\nDown with Bubble Gum and the Ninth Creation\nYou get on down, we've got the sound sensation\nKid Fresh is back from the eighties\nAnd we're doing it for the ladies\n\nVibes, vibrations\nVibes, vibrations\n\nWe got Vibes, vibrations\nWe got Vibes, vibrations\nVi...vi...", "image":

like Les McCan\n\nUp the crack of dawn, I'm on my way\nWe're talking two foot dump and there'll be no delay\nCause I'm gone, the shit's getting out of hand\nI'm changing my middle name to first Trem\n\nI'm walking on the rhythm like Philippe Petite\nI've got holes in my mouth where my teeth should be\nYou ask, Whatever happenened to the rappin' duke?\nI heard the Captain's gonna sign him to Jive and that's the truth\n\nTaking care of my functions, still smokin' up the shrubery\nI stopped eating chicken cause the shit was too rubbery\nMy produce, organic, from my own yard\nOnly the freshest herbs and growing's not too hard\n\nVibes, vibrations\nVibes, vibrations\n\nDreaming on it, screaming on it, ready to get dumb\nWaking up my long joint, ready to get some\nLooking at my board and my old boots\nSeeing a waist deep champagne moment of truth\n\nAnd on the court I've got game like my brother Matt\nI give a shout out -- so where you at?\nBut don't get souped, Matthew, cause I'm-a take ya\nHoratio Park right now and I'm-a shake ya\n\nGive me the fresh count, you know that I'm stressed out\nI need some inspiration, so get the best out\nLike Rock Master Scott, I'm on the request line\nWriting the fresh rhyme, having the best time\n\nGood vibes flowing all around\nNot a worry in mind as the friends around\nA shout out to Linda, riding pow forever\nWell the 'Bird is the word and you're as light as a feather'\n\nWell I smoke a bag of rat weed cause I don't care\nAnd I'm waxing old ladies out of their underwears\nI like the boomin' grannies in big old panties\nI'm giving it to grandma, making her crazy\n\nI might be a white boy, but I'm no goofy\nGot beats like Babalu on \"I Love Lucy\"\nI'm not like the Skipper on \"Fantasy Island\"\nI'm more like Captain Stubing when I go buck whylin'\n\nThe Cire Traverse out to Death shoot\nOr STH when they let me back at the Deuce\nCause I can't get enough of that funky stuff\nWhen the going gets rough, ain't going out in the sluff\n\nDown with Bubble Gum and the Ninth Creation\nYou get on down, we've got the sound sensation\nKid Fresh is back from the eighties\nAnd we're doing it for the ladies\n\nVibes, vibrations\nVibes, vibrations\n\nWe got Vibes, vibrations\nWe got Vibes, vibrations\nVi...vi..."}}, {"title": "The Update", "album": "Ill Communication", "year": "1994-05-31", "lyrics": "{Children of the earth!}\n\n[MCA]\n\nWell, I can hear the trumpets blowing, screaming out the end of time\nLook around and listen, and you'll see every sign\nThe waters are polluted as the forests are cut down\nBombing and drilling deep below the ground\nCheck the prophecies from around the world\nAnd look around now as it all unfurls\nLook into yourself and see what goes on\nGet a feeling in your heart of the right from the wrong\nBecause the Mother Earth needs to be respected\nBeen far too long that she's been neglected\nRace against race, such a foolish waste\nIt's like cuttin' off your nose to spite your face\nAnd at the end of the wars, what was the cost?\nWell, it's clear that the earth was the one who lost\nWe are one with her, as she is one with us\nIt's unreal how she is treated so unjust\nAs our planet grows smaller each and every day\nEveryone affecting everyone in every way\nWe're all citizens of the world community\nAll here together and we're searching for unity\nOver the years I've grown and changed so much\nThings I know now, years ago I couldn't touch\nThere are things I've done that I wouldn't do again\nBut I'm glad that I did cause I learned from them\nI just try to stay present, right here, right now\nNo worries, no fears, and without any doubts\n\nWell, it's about time, it's about time\nIt's about time, it's about time, it's about time\n\nCause in these times, these changing times\nA transition is occurring, and I am not blind\nAs the pendulum swings, a new age we enter\nAnd with every swing, it draws closer to the center\nYes, the storm before the calm and the wars that lead to love\nThings must run their course, so we push and we shove\nBut we're here to work it out, in one way or another\nTo find a mutual respect for ourselves and one another\nBut the true key is a trust in self\nFor when I trust myself, I fear no one else\nI took control of my life just as anyone can\nI want everyone to see it's in the palm of your hand\nThe past is gone, the future yet unborn\nBut right here and now is where it all goes on\nI know we can fix it and it's not too late\nI give respect To King and his nonviolent ways\nI dream and I hope and I won't forget\nSomeday I'm going to visit on a free Tibet\nSomeday I'm going to see us all joined as one\nAnd it would be too bad to blow it up before we're done\nCause we long behind the rage, learning from the pain\nThe love behind the tension like the sun behind the rain\nI'm sending loving light to all that is\nTo all creation and the life we live\nI'm not preaching bullshit, just speaking my mind\nCause I'm here now and it's about time\n\nWell, it's about time, it's about time\nIt's about time, it's about time, it's about time", "image":

polluted as the forests are cut down\nBombing and drilling deep below the ground\nCheck the prophecies from around the world\nAnd look around now as it all unfurls\nLook into yourself and see what goes on\nGet a feeling in your heart of the right from the wrong\nBecause the Mother Earth needs to be respected\nBeen far too long that she's been neglected\nRace against race, such a foolish waste\nIt's like cuttin' off your nose to spite your face\nAnd at the end of the wars, what was the cost?\nWell, it's clear that the earth was the one who lost\nWe are one with her, as she is one with us\nIt's unreal how she is treated so unjust\nAs our planet grows smaller each and every day\nEveryone affecting everyone in every way\nWe're all citizens of the world community\nAll here together and we're searching for unity\nOver the years I've grown and changed so much\nThings I know now, years ago I couldn't touch\nThere are things I've done that I wouldn't do again\nBut I'm glad that I did cause I learned from them\nI just try to stay present, right here, right now\nNo worries, no fears, and without any doubts\n\nWell, it's about time, it's about time\nIt's about time, it's about time, it's about time\n\nCause in these times, these changing times\nA transition is occurring, and I am not blind\nAs the pendulum swings, a new age we enter\nAnd with every swing, it draws closer to the center\nYes, the storm before the calm and the wars that lead to love\nThings must run their course, so we push and we shove\nBut we're here to work it out, in one way or another\nTo find a mutual respect for ourselves and one another\nBut the true key is a trust in self\nFor when I trust myself, I fear no one else\nI took control of my life just as anyone can\nI want everyone to see it's in the palm of your hand\nThe past is gone, the future yet unborn\nBut right here and now is where it all goes on\nI know we can fix it and it's not too late\nI give respect To King and his nonviolent ways\nI dream and I hope and I won't forget\nSomeday I'm going to visit on a free Tibet\nSomeday I'm going to see us all joined as one\nAnd it would be too bad to blow it up before we're done\nCause we long behind the rage, learning from the pain\nThe love behind the tension like the sun behind the rain\nI'm sending loving light to all that is\nTo all creation and the life we live\nI'm not preaching bullshit, just speaking my mind\nCause I'm here now and it's about time\n\nWell, it's about time, it's about time\nIt's about time, it's about time, it's about time"}}, {"title": "The Scoop", "album": "Ill Communication", "year": "1994-05-31", "lyrics": "I don't get blind, I don't drink wine\nI took A sledge hammer and I broke my nine\nBecause my life is mine, word is bond I rhyme\nAnd every day I write the book down line by line\nI'm feeling good when I do it like this\nSo come on and turn it up because you can't resist\n\nBecause I'm back with another track in which you lack\nCause things is wack and that's a fact\nBecause I'm on time, you're shouting rewind\nYou know it's Adrock that's blowing your mind\nMy shit is rough and you know it is so damn tough\n\nI'm getting intense, not talking nonsense\nI made up my mind, not sitting on the fence\nI don't always know the right from the wrong\nDo my best to figure it out and work it out in the long\nI try to do a lot, more than I can chew\nI balance out my ambitions what I got to do\n\nCheck it, better believe it y'all\nCheck it, better believe it y'all\nThis is rough and tough\n\nCause you hide in broad day light, a parasite\nA hypocrite, you take a peek quick\nYou turn your nose up (what), you think you're high up (uh)\nYou play it real safe and now your shit's fake\nI seen you hawking and then you clock my style\nAnd then you try to play it off like you think you're wild\n\nD.I.Y., that means do it yourself\nI don't sit around waitin' for someone's help\nI don't sit back and say \"Good enough\"\nI keep on striving, reinventing, keepin' it off the cuff\nSo I kick the level up cuhootnified\nMackadocius vibes, positively fortified\n\nI'm throwing rhymes down, kickin' them downtown\nTraveling high speed through the underground\nI kick it freestyle, make it worth your while\nI've got shelves of rhymes that I keep on file\nI'm feeling good now, back home again\nWell, New York City is the city that I feel at home in (woo)\nA blast from the Grasshoff, awhile it's been\nStepping into the future again (yeah)\n\nUh, and now I'm straight from 88\nTo 93 to 94, I'm out the door\n\nStep into the party with the Fila fresh gear\nPeople looking at me like I was David Koresh here\n\nKicking rhymes from the heart cause that's where I'm at\nFuck the bullshit, be it far from me to pop that\n\nIn the search for truth, I go a lot of ways\nThere's not a lot of peace that I find these days\nI try to stay cool, I try to stay calm\nBut my life is getting hectic like a smoke bomb\nSo I'll say it like the group Huggy Bear\nThere's a boy-girl revolution of which you should be aware\n\nYou can't dis me, it ain't worth it, B\nYou put yourself down and you don't even see\nCause I don't play that, I know who I am\nFor a minute I did but now I'm back again\nI'm feeling strong, see, trust myself, G\nWell, I stopped smoking cheeba and that was part of the key\n\nWe, we, we've got fire, we need water\nThere ain't no water, so I guess I ought to\nLeave you broke in a comatose state of mind\nAnd I'm blind and I'm working overtime, so check it\nI keep my rhymes in my little black book\nAnd I know you wanna take another look\n\n*This is rough and tough*", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ab0e17d7306c658a4cf1ef3beaac09c4.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Beastie

line\nI'm feeling good when I do it like this\nSo come on and turn it up because you can't resist\n\nBecause I'm back with another track in which you lack\nCause things is wack and that's a fact\nBecause I'm on time, you're shouting rewind\nYou know it's Adrock that's blowing your mind\nMy shit is rough and you know it is so damn tough\n\nI'm getting intense, not talking nonsense\nI made up my mind, not sitting on the fence\nI don't always know the right from the wrong\nDo my best to figure it out and work it out in the long\nI try to do a lot, more than I can chew\nI balance out my ambitions what I got to do\n\nCheck it, better believe it y'all\nCheck it, better believe it y'all\nThis is rough and tough\n\nCause you hide in broad day light, a parasite\nA hypocrite, you take a peek quick\nYou turn your nose up (what), you think you're high up (uh)\nYou play it real safe and now your shit's fake\nI seen you hawking and then you clock my style\nAnd then you try to play it off like you think you're wild\n\nD.I.Y., that means do it yourself\nI don't sit around waitin' for someone's help\nI don't sit back and say \"Good enough\"\nI keep on striving, reinventing, keepin' it off the cuff\nSo I kick the level up cuhootnified\nMackadocius vibes, positively fortified\n\nI'm throwing rhymes down, kickin' them downtown\nTraveling high speed through the underground\nI kick it freestyle, make it worth your while\nI've got shelves of rhymes that I keep on file\nI'm feeling good now, back home again\nWell, New York City is the city that I feel at home in (woo)\nA blast from the Grasshoff, awhile it's been\nStepping into the future again (yeah)\n\nUh, and now I'm straight from 88\nTo 93 to 94, I'm out the door\n\nStep into the party with the Fila fresh gear\nPeople looking at me like I was David Koresh here\n\nKicking rhymes from the heart cause that's where I'm at\nFuck the bullshit, be it far from me to pop that\n\nIn the search for truth, I go a lot of ways\nThere's not a lot of peace that I find these days\nI try to stay cool, I try to stay calm\nBut my life is getting hectic like a smoke bomb\nSo I'll say it like the group Huggy Bear\nThere's a boy-girl revolution of which you should be aware\n\nYou can't dis me, it ain't worth it, B\nYou put yourself down and you don't even see\nCause I don't play that, I know who I am\nFor a minute I did but now I'm back again\nI'm feeling strong, see, trust myself, G\nWell, I stopped smoking cheeba and that was part of the key\n\nWe, we, we've got fire, we need water\nThere ain't no water, so I guess I ought to\nLeave you broke in a comatose state of mind\nAnd I'm blind and I'm working overtime, so check it\nI keep my rhymes in my little black book\nAnd I know you wanna take another look\n\n*This is rough and tough*"}}], "artist": "Beastie Boys"}
