Guess what I saw?\nA fella tongue-kissin' my girl in her mouth\nI was so in shock my heart went down south\nSo please listen to the message that I send\nDon't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0966fd512329a4ba531fe7355e8470f4.500x493x1.jpg", "artist": "Biz Markie", "raw": {"annotation_count": 7, "api_path": "/songs/2694", "apple_music_id": "316484656", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/2694/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "The Biz\u2019s biggest (some would say only) hit is a hilarious tale of groupie love gone wrong.

wanted you to wait\nLet me tell ya a story of my situation\nI was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. nation\nThe way that I met her was on tour at a concert\nShe had long hair and a short miniskirt\nI just got onstage drippin', pourin' with sweat\nI was walkin' through the crowd and guess who I met\nI whispered in her ear, \"Come to the picture booth\nSo I can ask you some questions to see if you are a hundred proof\"\nI asked her her name, she said blah-blah-blah\nShe had 9/10 pants and a very big bra\nI took a couple of flicks and she was enthused\nI said, \"How do you like the show?\" She said, \"I was very amused\"\nI started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range\nBut when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange\nThen when I asked, \"Do ya have a man,\" she tried to pretend\nShe said, \"No I don't, I only have a friend\"\nCome on\nI'm not even goin' for it, this is what I'm goin' sing\n\n[Chorus]\nYou, you got what I need\nBut you say he's just a friend\nAnd you say he's just a friend, oh baby\nYou got what I need\nBut you say he's just a friend\nBut you say he's just a friend, oh baby\nYou got what I need\nBut you say he's just a friend\nBut you say he's just a friend\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo I took blah-blah's word for it at this time\nI thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime\n'Cause I have friends and that's a fact\nLike Agnes, Agatha, Germaine, and Jack\nForget about that, let's go into the story\nAbout a girl named blah-blah-blah that adored me\nSo we started talkin', getttin' familiar\nSpendin' a lot of time so we can build up\nA relationship or some understanding\nHow it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'\nEverything sounded so dandy and sweet\nI had no idea I was in for a treat\nAfter this was established, everything was cool\nThe tour was over and she went back to school\nI called every day to see how she was doin'\nEvery time that I called her it seemed somethin' was brewin'\nI called her room, a guy picked up, but then I called again\nI say, \"Yo, who was that?\" \"Oh, he's just a friend\"\nDon't gimme that, don't ever gimme that\nJus' bust this\n\n[Chorus]\nYou, you got what I need\nBut you say he's just a friend\nAnd you say he's just a friend, oh baby\nYou got what I need\nBut you say he's just a friend\nBut you say he's just a friend, oh baby\nYou got what I need\nBut you say he's just a friend\nBut you say he's just a friend\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo I came to her college on a surprise visit\nTo see my girl that was so exquisite\nIt was a school day, I knew she was there\nThe first semester of the school year\nI went to a gate to ask where was her dorm\nThis guy made me fill out a visitor's form\nHe told me where it was and I was on my way\nTo see my baby doll, I was happy to say\nI arrived in front of the dormitory\n\"Yo, could you tell me where is door three?\"\nThey showed me where it was for the moment\nI didn't know I was in for such an event\nSo I came to her room and opened the door\nOh, snap! Guess what I saw?\nA fella tongue-kissin' my girl in her mouth\nI was so in shock my heart went down south\nSo please listen to the message that I send\nDon't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend"}}, {"title": "The Vapors", "album": "Goin' Off", "year": "1988-03-01", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nRadio, TV, and even the press\nKnow the meanin of V-A-P-O-R-S\nThe meanin' of this word without no doubt\nMeans nobody wants to be there when you\u2019re down and out\nOnce you\u2019re established and got a lot of money\nEverybody wanna be your buddy and honey\nLike tall buildings they call skyscrapers\n\n[Verse 1]\nCan you feel it, nothing can save ya\nFor this is the season of catching the vapors\nAnd since I got time, what I'm gonna do\nIs tell you how this spreaded throughout my crew\nWell you all know TJ Swan who sang on my records\n\"Make the Music\", \"Nobody Beats the Biz\", well, check it\nBack in the days before this began\nHe used to try to talk to this girl name Fran\nThe type of female with fly Gucci wear\nWith big truck jewelry and extensions in her hair\nWhen Swan tried to kick it, she always fessed\nTalking about \"Nigga please, you work for UPS\"\nSince he wasn't no type of big drug dealer\nMy man TJ Swan didn't appeal to her\nBut now he trucks gold and wear fly Bally boots\nRough leather fashion and tough silk suits\nNow she stop fronting and wants to speak and\nBe coming to all the shows every single weekend\nTo get his beeper number, she'd be begging please\nDying for the day to get skeezed\n\n[Hook]\nShe caught the vapors\nShe caught the vapors\nShe caught the vapors\nShe caught the vapors\n\n[Verse 2]\nI got another partner that's calm and plain\nHe goes by the name of the Big Daddy Kane\nA mellow type of fellow that's laid back\nBack in the days he was nothing like that\nI remember when he used to fight every day\nWhat grown-ups would tell him he would never obey\nHe wore his pants hanging down and his sneakers untied\nAnd a rasta-type Kangol tilted to the side\nAround his neighborhood people treated him bad\nAnd said he was the worst thing his moms ever had\nThey said that he will grow up to be nothing but a hoodlum\nOr either in jail, or someone would shoot him\nBut now he's grown up, to their surprise\nBig Daddy got a hit record selling worldwide\nNow the same people that didn't like him as a child\nBe saying can I borrow a dollar, ooh, you're a star now\n\n[Hook]\nThey caught the vapors\nThey caught the vapors\nThey caught the vapors\nThey caught the vapors\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow I got a cousin by the name of Vaughan Lee\nBetter known to y'all as Cutmaster Cool V\nHe cuts, scratch, transform with finesse\n{imitates cuts and scratches} and all that mess\nWell I remember when he first started to rock\nAnd tried to get this job in a record shop\nHe was in it to win it but the boss fronted\nSaid, \"Sorry Mr. Lee, but there's no help wanted\"\nNow my cuz Vaughan still tried on and on and on\n'Til the like break of dawn\nTo put this j-o-b in effect\nBut they'd look right past him and be like, \"Next\"\nNow for the year of '88\nCool V is making dollars so my cousin's like straight\nHe walks into the same record shop as before\nAnd the boss be like, \"Vaughan, welcome to my store\"\nOffering him a job but naw, he don't want it\nDamn it feels good to see people up on it\nCause I remember when at first they wasn't\nNow guess what they caught from my cousin\nThe vapors\n\n[Hook]\nThey caught the vapors\nThey caught the vapors\nThey caught the vapors\nThey caught the vapors\n\n[Verse 4]\nLast subject of the story is about Biz Mark\nI had to work for mine to put your body in park\nWhen I was a teenager, I wanted to be down\nWith a lot of MC-DJ'ing crews in town\nSo in school on Nobel Street, I say \"Can I be down, champ\"\nThey said no and treated me like a wet food stamp\nAfter getting rejected I was very depressed\nSat and wrote some def doo-doo rhymes at my rest\nWhen I used to come to parties they'd make me pay\nI would have to beg to get on the mic and rap that day\nI was never into girls, I was just into my music\nThey acted like I wanted to keep it instead of trying to use it\nBut now things switched, without belief\n\"Yo, Biz, do you remember me from Noble Street, chief?\nWe used to be down back in the days\"\nIt happens all the time and never cease to amaze\n\n[Hook]\nThey caught the vapors\nThey caught the vapors\nThey caught the vapors\nThey caught the vapors", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a15a6f9af05a4f062ad1054d8dabf5f6.600x600x1.jpg", "artist": "Biz Markie", "raw": {"annotation_count": 6, "api_path": "/songs/10396", "apple_music_id": "1229603256", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/10396/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "\u201cThe Vapors\u201d represents the ironic life story of Biz Markie and his fellow Juice Crew members TJ Swan, Big Daddy Kane, and Cutmaster Cool V.

this word without no doubt\nMeans nobody wants to be there when you\u2019re down and out\nOnce you\u2019re established and got a lot of money\nEverybody wanna be your buddy and honey\nLike tall buildings they call skyscrapers\n\n[Verse 1]\nCan you feel it, nothing can save ya\nFor this is the season of catching the vapors\nAnd since I got time, what I'm gonna do\nIs tell you how this spreaded throughout my crew\nWell you all know TJ Swan who sang on my records\n\"Make the Music\", \"Nobody Beats the Biz\", well, check it\nBack in the days before this began\nHe used to try to talk to this girl name Fran\nThe type of female with fly Gucci wear\nWith big truck jewelry and extensions in her hair\nWhen Swan tried to kick it, she always fessed\nTalking about \"Nigga please, you work for UPS\"\nSince he wasn't no type of big drug dealer\nMy man TJ Swan didn't appeal to her\nBut now he trucks gold and wear fly Bally boots\nRough leather fashion and tough silk suits\nNow she stop fronting and wants to speak and\nBe coming to all the shows every single weekend\nTo get his beeper number, she'd be begging please\nDying for the day to get skeezed\n\n[Hook]\nShe caught the vapors\nShe caught the vapors\nShe caught the vapors\nShe caught the vapors\n\n[Verse 2]\nI got another partner that's calm and plain\nHe goes by the name of the Big Daddy Kane\nA mellow type of fellow that's laid back\nBack in the days he was nothing like that\nI remember when he used to fight every day\nWhat grown-ups would tell him he would never obey\nHe wore his pants hanging down and his sneakers untied\nAnd a rasta-type Kangol tilted to the side\nAround his neighborhood people treated him bad\nAnd said he was the worst thing his moms ever had\nThey said that he will grow up to be nothing but a hoodlum\nOr either in jail, or someone would shoot him\nBut now he's grown up, to their surprise\nBig Daddy got a hit record selling worldwide\nNow the same people that didn't like him as a child\nBe saying can I borrow a dollar, ooh, you're a star now\n\n[Hook]\nThey caught the vapors\nThey caught the vapors\nThey caught the vapors\nThey caught the vapors\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow I got a cousin by the name of Vaughan Lee\nBetter known to y'all as Cutmaster Cool V\nHe cuts, scratch, transform with finesse\n{imitates cuts and scratches} and all that mess\nWell I remember when he first started to rock\nAnd tried to get this job in a record shop\nHe was in it to win it but the boss fronted\nSaid, \"Sorry Mr. Lee, but there's no help wanted\"\nNow my cuz Vaughan still tried on and on and on\n'Til the like break of dawn\nTo put this j-o-b in effect\nBut they'd look right past him and be like, \"Next\"\nNow for the year of '88\nCool V is making dollars so my cousin's like straight\nHe walks into the same record shop as before\nAnd the boss be like, \"Vaughan, welcome to my store\"\nOffering him a job but naw, he don't want it\nDamn it feels good to see people up on it\nCause I remember when at first they wasn't\nNow guess what they caught from my cousin\nThe vapors\n\n[Hook]\nThey caught the vapors\nThey caught the vapors\nThey caught the vapors\nThey caught the vapors\n\n[Verse 4]\nLast subject of the story is about Biz Mark\nI had to work for mine to put your body in park\nWhen I was a teenager, I wanted to be down\nWith a lot of MC-DJ'ing crews in town\nSo in school on Nobel Street, I say \"Can I be down, champ\"\nThey said no and treated me like a wet food stamp\nAfter getting rejected I was very depressed\nSat and wrote some def doo-doo rhymes at my rest\nWhen I used to come to parties they'd make me pay\nI would have to beg to get on the mic and rap that day\nI was never into girls, I was just into my music\nThey acted like I wanted to keep it instead of trying to use it\nBut now things switched, without belief\n\"Yo, Biz, do you remember me from Noble Street, chief?\nWe used to be down back in the days\"\nIt happens all the time and never cease to amaze\n\n[Hook]\nThey caught the vapors\nThey caught the vapors\nThey caught the vapors\nThey caught the vapors"}}, {"title": "Nobody Beats the Biz", "album": "Goin' Off", "year":

in a trance and\nHypnotize your body and, like you do Bacardi and\nYou won't be fighting or illing, you just be partying\nDown, with the funky sound with yours truly\nI'm the original B-I-Z M-A-R-K-I

for the people that be clocking\nNot sayin that you're on mine or on it like a hornet\nBut you pay for a good performance, doggone it, you want it\nThat's why I'm here, to be like letting you knowing\nThat I'mma highly recognized as the king of discoing\nMaking people laugh and have a lot of enjoyment\nI'm the best person for this type of employment\nThat's why...\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nOn and on to the break of dawn\nWhen you buy food cheap, you need a coupon\nOr catch a sale retail, before it gets stale\nSo hurry up and get the WIC check out the mail\nAnd shop non-stop, but how I hip-hop\nOn the mic and like make you co-op-\n-erate with the rhythm, that is what I give em\nReagan is the Pres but I voted for Shirley Chisholm\nIt might sound confusing, the style that I'm using\nBut in the end I'm sure that you will find it quite amusing\nAnd funny, oh honey, it's just ridiculous\nDon't try to front, come on and admit you was\nThrilled, chilled, your heart was fulfilled\nSo respect the architect as I begin to build\nScience and my reliance is upon my rap\nLike Carl Lewis I get to it, so let's go the lap\n\n[Hook]", "image":

"lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYes, y'all and, to the like beat and\nYou could either dance or just have a seat and\nListen to the way and, what I am displaying\nA different kind of rapper language that I am saying\nTo all the party people that absorbs the info\nWhen it come to rocking parties I am a nympho\nManiac, brainiac for doing my dance\nAnd my record Make the Music will put you in a trance and\nHypnotize your body and, like you do Bacardi and\nYou won't be fighting or illing, you just be partying\nDown, with the funky sound with yours truly\nI'm the original B-I-Z M-A-R-K-I but the E\nI came to have fun and, not be number one and\nJust hear to let you know, who's like running the place\nAnd everywhere that I perform and do a show\nAs long as you know that...\n\n[Hook: TJ Swan]\nNobody beats the Biz\n(Nobody beats the Biz)\n(repeat 4X)\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou know me as the B-I-Z M-A-R-K-I-E and\nI go for what I know doing a show for human beings\nI'm guaranteed to rock I make the ladies scream and shout\nI'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out\nThe Mardi rapper toe-tapper always having fun\nAnd when you hear the Biz Markie, I get the job done\nYes I'm the M-A-R the K-I-E you know that's me\nI got the stutter step to keep in check my speed is so unique\nThey say I look and sound funny but I don't be caring\nI rock the Latin Quarter, Rooftop, Union Square and\nRoseland, the Heartthrob, Madison Square Garden\nEven rocked for the World\u2019s Fair at Javits Center\nPardon the way that I be talking 'bout the places I be rocking\nI love to perform for the people that be clocking\nNot sayin that you're on mine or on it like a hornet\nBut you pay for a good performance, doggone it, you want it\nThat's why I'm here, to be like letting you knowing\nThat I'mma highly recognized as the king of discoing\nMaking people laugh and have a lot of enjoyment\nI'm the best person for this type of employment\nThat's why...\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nOn and on to the break of dawn\nWhen you buy food cheap, you need a coupon\nOr catch a sale retail, before it gets stale\nSo hurry up and get the WIC check out the mail\nAnd shop non-stop, but how I hip-hop\nOn the mic and like make you co-op-\n-erate with the rhythm, that is what I give em\nReagan is the Pres but I voted for Shirley Chisholm\nIt might sound confusing, the style that I'm using\nBut in the end I'm sure that you will find it quite amusing\nAnd funny, oh honey, it's just ridiculous\nDon't try to front, come on and admit you was\nThrilled, chilled, your heart was fulfilled\nSo respect the architect as I begin to build\nScience and my reliance is upon my rap\nLike Carl Lewis I get to it, so let's go the lap\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "Pickin' Boogers", "album": "Goin' Off", "year": "1988-03-01", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nNow this may sound disgusting and like very gross\nBut it's sure to have you trippin', so yo, listen close\nIt's not bright as the sun or sweet like sugar\nBut it's rather on the bug tip and it's called Pickin' Boogers\nNow what I'm MCin' might not seem kosher to you\nBut it's still somethin' we all have to do\nSo go up your nose with a finger or two\nAnd pull out one or a crusty crew\nYo, don't try to front like it's so gloomy and gray\n'Cause we all pick our boogers some time every day\nWhether out in the open or on a sneak tip\nWith a finger, tissue, or even a Q-Tip\nTake it from the Biz Markie because I'm jokin'\nAnd also, remember this slogan\n\"Hey, ma, what's for dinner?\nGo up your nose and pick a winner\"\n\n[Hook]\nPickin' Boogers (4x)\n\n[Verse 2]\nLet me tell you what happened on the train, man\nI was coolin' one day with my partner Kane\nHeaded up to the Rooftop, ridin' the D train\nWhen the man sittin' next to me was so profane\nHe'd stick his finger up his nose, then do a drain\n(You should 'a moved)\nI was just about, but all of a sudden, homeboy just pulled out\nA big green slimy \u2014 nah, I'm not neven gonna say it\nBut it weighed a good pound if you tried to weigh it\nHe sat there for a while with it in his hand\nSo I tried to play cool and like ignore the man\nSo I laid my head back to catch a quick a nap\nAll of a sudden he plucked it dead in my lap\nNow Kane sat there laughing like it was all a joke\nBut a brother like Biz Markie had almost choked\nSo I dug up my nose and pulled out about five\nAnd plucked every last one of them dead in his eye\nThen the man jumped up and said \"What's wrong with you?\"\nAnd wiped them off his face and said \"I can't mess with you!\"\nLike if I did something that was so full of shame\nBut yo, you got to know the name of the game\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nHmmm....\nNow let me take a trip down memory lane\nBack in public school with my partner Kane\nWhen I was class clown, and he was my brother\nSittin' at the desk pluckin' boogers at each other\nNever doin' work as we was supposed\n'Cause we was too busy diggin' up our nose\nAnd in the lunchroom you would talk about rude\nGod forbid the person that'd leave his food\nNo matter who you are we didn't give a damn\nWe even put teachers down with the program\nWhether if it was a woman or if you a man\nWe put boogers on our fingers then shake ya hand\nCatch anyone from anywhere\nBut the best fun about it catchin' Kane out there\nEspecially when we playin' ball in the gym\nI put boogers on the basketball and pass it to him\nNow we're grown up and things have changed\nBut we still be playin' the pickin' boogers game\nJust last night, when Kane was gettin' ready\nI slipped a little green one inside his spaghetti\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 4]\nLet me tell you what happened to me with this girl...\nOne night at Latin Quarters I was standin' at ease\nI saw this gorgeous young lady that I wanted to skeez\nI didn't show enough that I really did want it\nSo, no half steppin', I pushed up on it\nPulled out the gold cable and I knocked her with phat\nHad a spotlight beamin' on my Biz Marck hat\nBut when she stepped in the light and she got real close\nI saw a tiny weeny booger on the tip of her nose\nShe was dressed real def and her body was hooked\nBut that dried up booger just ruined her look\nI wanted to tell her about it but I couldn't be bold\nSo I played if off and said \"that's a cute green mole\"\nI was hopin' from that she would wipe it away\nBut she didn't do nothin' I guess she wanted it to stay\nI said before you get my number, I don't mean to diss you\nBut write it in your hand because you're gonna need the tissue", "image":

very gross\nBut it's sure to have you trippin', so yo, listen close\nIt's not bright as the sun or sweet like sugar\nBut it's rather on the bug tip and it's called Pickin' Boogers\nNow what I'm MCin' might not seem kosher to you\nBut it's still somethin' we all have to do\nSo go up your nose with a finger or two\nAnd pull out one or a crusty crew\nYo, don't try to front like it's so gloomy and gray\n'Cause we all pick our boogers some time every day\nWhether out in the open or on a sneak tip\nWith a finger, tissue, or even a Q-Tip\nTake it from the Biz Markie because I'm jokin'\nAnd also, remember this slogan\n\"Hey, ma, what's for dinner?\nGo up your nose and pick a winner\"\n\n[Hook]\nPickin' Boogers (4x)\n\n[Verse 2]\nLet me tell you what happened on the train, man\nI was coolin' one day with my partner Kane\nHeaded up to the Rooftop, ridin' the D train\nWhen the man sittin' next to me was so profane\nHe'd stick his finger up his nose, then do a drain\n(You should 'a moved)\nI was just about, but all of a sudden, homeboy just pulled out\nA big green slimy \u2014 nah, I'm not neven gonna say it\nBut it weighed a good pound if you tried to weigh it\nHe sat there for a while with it in his hand\nSo I tried to play cool and like ignore the man\nSo I laid my head back to catch a quick a nap\nAll of a sudden he plucked it dead in my lap\nNow Kane sat there laughing like it was all a joke\nBut a brother like Biz Markie had almost choked\nSo I dug up my nose and pulled out about five\nAnd plucked every last one of them dead in his eye\nThen the man jumped up and said \"What's wrong with you?\"\nAnd wiped them off his face and said \"I can't mess with you!\"\nLike if I did something that was so full of shame\nBut yo, you got to know the name of the game\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nHmmm....\nNow let me take a trip down memory lane\nBack in public school with my partner Kane\nWhen I was class clown, and he was my brother\nSittin' at the desk pluckin' boogers at each other\nNever doin' work as we was supposed\n'Cause we was too busy diggin' up our nose\nAnd in the lunchroom you would talk about rude\nGod forbid the person that'd leave his food\nNo matter who you are we didn't give a damn\nWe even put teachers down with the program\nWhether if it was a woman or if you a man\nWe put boogers on our fingers then shake ya hand\nCatch anyone from anywhere\nBut the best fun about it catchin' Kane out there\nEspecially when we playin' ball in the gym\nI put boogers on the basketball and pass it to him\nNow we're grown up and things have changed\nBut we still be playin' the pickin' boogers game\nJust last night, when Kane was gettin' ready\nI slipped a little green one inside his spaghetti\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 4]\nLet me tell you what happened to me with this girl...\nOne night at Latin Quarters I was standin' at ease\nI saw this gorgeous young lady that I wanted to skeez\nI didn't show enough that I really did want it\nSo, no half steppin', I pushed up on it\nPulled out the gold cable and I knocked her with phat\nHad a spotlight beamin' on my Biz Marck hat\nBut when she stepped in the light and she got real close\nI saw a tiny weeny booger on the tip of her nose\nShe was dressed real def and her body was hooked\nBut that dried up booger just ruined her look\nI wanted to tell her about it but I couldn't be bold\nSo I played if off and said \"that's a cute green mole\"\nI was hopin' from that she would wipe it away\nBut she didn't do nothin' I guess she wanted it to stay\nI said before you get my number, I don't mean to diss you\nBut write it in your hand because you're gonna need the tissue"}}, {"title": "Make the Music With Your Mouth, Biz", "album": "Goin' Off", "year": "1988-03-01", "lyrics": "[Biz Markie]\nAh one two, ah one two\nAh one two, ah one two\nI'd like to.. introduce myself..\nMy name is.. ah Biz Markie..\n\n[Verse One]\nWell I'm the human orchestra called Biz Markie\nMakin music orderly is my specialty\nWhen I go {*BOOM*} ah one two, girls get excited\nWhen they hear my lyrics they wanna recite 'em\nI know y'all in the mood, just go with the flow\nAnd I can play rappin records and all disco\nLike \"Beat It,\" \"Billie Jean,\" by Michael Jackson\nOr the Treacherous 3 record, they call \"Action\"\nWhen you hear me do it, you will be shocked and amazed\nIt's the brand new thing they call the human beatbox craze\n\n[Hook]\nMake the music with your mouth, biz!\n{*Biz Markie beatboxes*}\nMake the music with your mouth, biz!\n{*Biz Markie beatboxes*}\nMake the music with your mouth, biz!\n{*Biz Markie beatboxes*}\n\n[Verse Two]\nWell I don't just do the beatbox, I rock on the mic\nAnd all the rhymes that I say, all the people like\nI get the crowd jumpin, get the girl's hearts pumpin\nAll the party people say, \"Isn't he somethin?\"\nRock from New York City all the way down South\nSayin rhymes and makin music, with my mouth\nI'mma tell you party people how I began\nIt started when I'm livin in Long Is-land\nHey when I was a kid I used to play in the streets\nMakin sounds with my mouth, all sorts of beats\nGrown people, used to say - WHAT?\nGrown people, used to say - WHAT'S..\n.. wrong with that kid makin that strange noise\nIt was like, for all the fly girls and all the homeboys\nThen I tried it at a homeboy's basement par-ty\nThey thought it was a record, they ain't know it was me\nWhen they came by the DJ, and saw who it is\nThey said, \"Make the music with your mouth, Biz!\"\n\n[Hook]\n\n{*song continues as just a beat for a while*}\n\n[Verse Three]\nIt may look and sound easy doin the human beatbox\nBut it's real difficult, even knocked me out my socks\nIt's a movement combination with your lip tongue and throat\nUse your teeth and your nose for a mysterious high note\nI like doin it as a hobby or a job\nPeople treat me like a star and surround me in the mall\nIt's not all the props, spittin, breathin hard and doin\nYou need practice, be ambitious in the schoolin\nLet me tell you party people, you gotta admit\nAnything than you want you gotta work hard for it\nThat's why I like doin sounds, that's hard to achieve\nMakin two or three sounds at one time you can't believe\nWhen I walk down the street, people crowd around me\nAnd say, \"HOW YOU MAKE ALL THEM SOUNDS at one time, Biz Markie?\"\nI tell 'em it takes a lot of practice, and lip control\nI've been doin it since, fifteen years old\nAnd everywhere I do it, the people say I'm good\nI even get big respect in my own neighborhood\nI'm tellin you a fact, it's just like it is\nEven moms, pops, and cops say, \"Whattup, Biz?\"\nEverywhere I go, I always rocked the boat\nGonna end this rhyme, with this one note\nNot gonna act conceited and say I'm the best\nBut I'm guaranteed to pass any kind of test\nI say def rhymes, with funky fresh lyrics\nWhen I do the beat the party people go into HYSTERICS!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse Four]\nYou heard the proceedin, now here's the sequel\nAll human beatboxes is not created equal\nThat's why I'm here, to say today\nThat I'm doin my beat in a special way\nMakin musical tunes, orally, I have perspective\nI'm very well known, and greatly respected\nI like to thank people, without no doubt\nPeace hi party people it's time to break ou--\n\n[Outro - singing while Biz beatboxes]\nMake the music.. make the music..\nMAKE THE MUSIC.. with your mouth!\nMake the music.. make the music..\nMAKE THE MUSIC.. with your mouth!\nMake the music.. make the music..\nMAKE THE MUSIC.. with your mouth!\nMake the music.. make the music..\nMAKE THE MUSIC.. with your mouth!\n\nMAKE THE MUSIC.. with your mouth!\n\n{*Biz continues beatboxing and scatting to the end*}", "image":

myself..\nMy name is.. ah Biz Markie..\n\n[Verse One]\nWell I'm the human orchestra called Biz Markie\nMakin music orderly is my specialty\nWhen I go {*BOOM*} ah one two, girls get excited\nWhen they hear my lyrics they wanna recite 'em\nI know y'all in the mood, just go with the flow\nAnd I can play rappin records and all disco\nLike \"Beat It,\" \"Billie Jean,\" by Michael Jackson\nOr the Treacherous 3 record, they call \"Action\"\nWhen you hear me do it, you will be shocked and amazed\nIt's the brand new thing they call the human beatbox craze\n\n[Hook]\nMake the music with your mouth, biz!\n{*Biz Markie beatboxes*}\nMake the music with your mouth, biz!\n{*Biz Markie beatboxes*}\nMake the music with your mouth, biz!\n{*Biz Markie beatboxes*}\n\n[Verse Two]\nWell I don't just do the beatbox, I rock on the mic\nAnd all the rhymes that I say, all the people like\nI get the crowd jumpin, get the girl's hearts pumpin\nAll the party people say, \"Isn't he somethin?\"\nRock from New York City all the way down South\nSayin rhymes and makin music, with my mouth\nI'mma tell you party people how I began\nIt started when I'm livin in Long Is-land\nHey when I was a kid I used to play in the streets\nMakin sounds with my mouth, all sorts of beats\nGrown people, used to say - WHAT?\nGrown people, used to say - WHAT'S..\n.. wrong with that kid makin that strange noise\nIt was like, for all the fly girls and all the homeboys\nThen I tried it at a homeboy's basement par-ty\nThey thought it was a record, they ain't know it was me\nWhen they came by the DJ, and saw who it is\nThey said, \"Make the music with your mouth, Biz!\"\n\n[Hook]\n\n{*song continues as just a beat for a while*}\n\n[Verse Three]\nIt may look and sound easy doin the human beatbox\nBut it's real difficult, even knocked me out my socks\nIt's a movement combination with your lip tongue and throat\nUse your teeth and your nose for a mysterious high note\nI like doin it as a hobby or a job\nPeople treat me like a star and surround me in the mall\nIt's not all the props, spittin, breathin hard and doin\nYou need practice, be ambitious in the schoolin\nLet me tell you party people, you gotta admit\nAnything than you want you gotta work hard for it\nThat's why I like doin sounds, that's hard to achieve\nMakin two or three sounds at one time you can't believe\nWhen I walk down the street, people crowd around me\nAnd say, \"HOW YOU MAKE ALL THEM SOUNDS at one time, Biz Markie?\"\nI tell 'em it takes a lot of practice, and lip control\nI've been doin it since, fifteen years old\nAnd everywhere I do it, the people say I'm good\nI even get big respect in my own neighborhood\nI'm tellin you a fact, it's just like it is\nEven moms, pops, and cops say, \"Whattup, Biz?\"\nEverywhere I go, I always rocked the boat\nGonna end this rhyme, with this one note\nNot gonna act conceited and say I'm the best\nBut I'm guaranteed to pass any kind of test\nI say def rhymes, with funky fresh lyrics\nWhen I do the beat the party people go into HYSTERICS!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse Four]\nYou heard the proceedin, now here's the sequel\nAll human beatboxes is not created equal\nThat's why I'm here, to say today\nThat I'm doin my beat in a special way\nMakin musical tunes, orally, I have perspective\nI'm very well known, and greatly respected\nI like to thank people, without no doubt\nPeace hi party people it's time to break ou--\n\n[Outro - singing while Biz beatboxes]\nMake the music.. make the music..\nMAKE THE MUSIC.. with your mouth!\nMake the music.. make the music..\nMAKE THE MUSIC.. with your mouth!\nMake the music.. make the music..\nMAKE THE MUSIC.. with your mouth!\nMake the music.. make the music..\nMAKE THE MUSIC.. with your mouth!\n\nMAKE THE MUSIC.. with your mouth!\n\n{*Biz continues beatboxing and scatting to the end*}"}}, {"title": "Biz is Goin' Off", "album": "Goin' Off", "year": "1988-03-01", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nHey to everybody

never trippin, king of crowd pleasin\nI can turn it out without a doubt in any season\nI entertain crowds, a million and thous'\nHomeboys makin noise, as I do browse through a girl's blouse\nSay the funky rhyme to make the girls get naked\nI can turn it out, with different sounds on my record\nThat I say give 'em, as y'all exault the rhythm\nThe magnificent record maker of Prism\n\n[Hook: repeat 2X]\nThe Biz, Mark, is, ah goin off\nThe Biz, Mark, is, ah goin off\nThe Biz, Mark, is, ah goin off\nThe Biz {*\"Go off, go off!\"*}\n\n[Verse 2]\nHa ha ha ha ha!

Then try to get illy\nWith me the inhuman, because I'm like boomin\nReagan is the Pres, but so was Harry Truman\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow! I make rhymes, each and every day\nAnd always seem to come up with somethin fresh to say\nIn January, February, March April May\nAnd the other seven months of the year, but anyway\nHey, feel the lay okay, here's a rhyme I must display\nWhen I'm finished you be in it sayin HIP HIP HOORAY!\nI will be an emcee, 'til I'm old and grey\nAnd I can even rock the mic with tooth decay, decay\nYo - ladies of the 80's know that I'm the\nOriginal B-I-Z-M-A-R-K-I say with an E\nYou know me, and my man Big Daddy\nI can't forget, Cutmaster Cool V\nAnd my partner, my best friend TJ Swannie\nRockin the mic would say most definitely\nSo listen don't be missin, I will never be dissin\nI just rock the mic, and always have discipline\nListen to the brother ain't no other you discover\nI rock up the mic just like if I'm, your, mother!\n\n[Outro]\nGo Biz Mark!

Markie\nThat made you dance, make the music with my mouth, and all\nBut I'm here to talk about the Albee Square Mall\nA place where people shop in downtown Brooklyn\nWhere I can be found if you're lookin\nFor me, the B-i-z, so just come check me out\nCause 24/7 I'm mikin the house\nSo when I come in the Mall, and then I start to roam\nYou wouldn't think it's a store, you would think it's my home\nCause when I come in the place, then I hang up a sign\nReads 'home sweet home' - this house is mine\n\n[Chorus: T.J. Swan]\nAlbee Square Mall\nMy house is the Albee Square Mall\nMy house is the Albee Square Mall\nMy house is the Albee Square Mall\n\n[Verse 2]\nI been to many malls from state to state\nBut I've never been in, say, one this great, I hate\nTo say, about the other shopping centers that's left\nBut the Albee Square Mall is the doo-doo-def\nI be in there everyday, walkin around chillin\nFrom when they opened all the way until when\nIt's about time for the place to close\nI'm just running things like a pair of panty hose\nThey all know me, the Biz Markie\nI get more respect than the average employee\nCould work in every store in the mall\nBecause the place is my house from wall to wall\nIf I could move in, party people, I just might\nSo I could stay forever, and it won't be just like\nA bum that you see sleepin on a park bench\nSo how will it be when you see Biz Markie\nI fade them all, been havin fun\nSee, to me this mall is like number one\nAnd any other shoppers there that try to compare\nThere ain't no way they could hang out with Albee Square\n\n[ T.J. Swan ]\nAlbee Square Mall\nMy house is the Albee Square Mall\nMy house is the Albee Square Mall\nMy house is the Albee Square Mall\n\n[ Verse 3 ]\nI step in the place and shop around for a while\nBuy some jewelry for Treny and Ali, and after that I'll\nGo take a stroll inside of Gibb's Pups\nThen buy some fresh silks, Bally's too\nNext stop Olympic, wanted to buy some sneakers\nThen hit the Game Room to pick me up a Cesar\nStroll around with a fly female\nWhile security's riffin about leanin on the rail\nAfter that I go eat some food at Wendy's\nIn the Albee cafateria, could be shoppin plenty\nFrom store to store just stuffin' face\nAnd I do the pfrr-one-two while sayin my grace\nFinally I step off all alone\nUp to the top level to use the telephone\nNever use a quarter, cause I got a calling card\nSo I can reach out and touch everybody I know\nThat's where I be until the day is done\nJust coolin in the place that's number one\nSo next time you'll be in Brooklyn walkin around\nPlay like \"Price Is Right\" and \"come on down\"\nAnd\n\n[ T.J. Swan ]\nGo shoppin\nGo shoppin\nGo shop - let's all go shoppin (3x)\n\nGo shoppin\nGo shoppin\nGo shoppin - Swan and Biz go shoppin\n\nLa-la-lala\nLa-la-la-la-lala (till end)\n\n[ Biz gives shout-outs

discrimination, I love all the nations\nWhether you're Jamaican, Hawaiian or Haitian\n( ? ) what a man don't got\nAnd just for that I wanna thank you a lot\nWord is bond, y'all look so good\nEvery time I see ya in my neighborhood\nMy crew bugs out when they're in the party\nInstead of baby got back baby got body\nCause you're all shapes and sizes, look good in jeans\nWanna do me somethin juicy, I know what they mean\nI'm not tryin to be nasty, I'm just keepin it real\nThis goes out to my people who know how I feel\n\n[Chorus: Lil' Kal] + (Biz Markie)\n(All you ladies in the nice tight jeans)\nYou look good to me\n(All you ladies in the nice tight skirts)\nYou look good to me\n(All you ladies in the nice tight shorts)\nYou look good to me\n(All you ladies in the nice tight ( ? ))\nYou look good to me\n\n[Verse 2: Biz Markie]\nNow that you kknow what I'm talkin about\nI know you will agree without a reasonable doubt\nNothing's like a nice derriere\nLooks so good, it's just not fair\nNow let me tell you a story about a girl named Judy\nWas a 5 in the face, but had a real nice booty\nIt was so soft and mesmerizin\nI met her in Jersey by ( ? )\nOh my goodness, I almost lost my mind\nWhen I saw this hee-haw that was so divine\nNow I would usually just kept goin\nBut it hypnotized me the way she was throwin\nI said, \"You want a burger and fries with that shake?\"\nShe said, \"No, I want shrimp, lobbster and a steak\"\nBein Rockefeller is not my duty\nThe only reason I changed my mind is because..\n\n[Chorus: Lil' Kal]\nYou look good to me\n\n[Verse 3: Biz Markie]\nTell you what happened to me while I was mindin my biz\nI came across a girl by the name of Liz\nPuerto Rican or Spanish, almost went frantic\nFor bein a 10 she was a body mechanic\nI was bee-beein on what I was seein\nIt's like Pocahontas jumped out the TV, an\nHourglass shape that made me go ape\nAsk Lil' Mo, she was a 'superwoman' with a cape\nShe couldn't speak no English, I had Fat Joe with me\nSo he could tell me what she was sayin about me\nShe said, \"I like papi with big belly\"\nI said, \"Why'd you tell her in Spanish that I want her tele\n-phone,\" now you know it's on\nLike hot butter on say what, the popcorn\nI had to have that cause she's a cutie\nAnd you know the other reason why is because..\n\n[Chorus: Lil' Kal]\nYou look good to me\nWhen I walk through the club what do I see\nA real fly cutie\nYou look good to me\nYou look good to me\nThat ass is fat\nOh Lord, yeah\nYou yeah, oh, look good\nOh yeah\nEverytime I walk by\nI wanna look in your eye\nAnd you look so fly\nOh yeah\nWhen I walk through the club what do I see\nA real fly cutie lookin at me\nI wanna"}}, {"title": "Chinese Food", "album": "Weekend Warrior", "year": "2003-11-18", "lyrics": "Yo,

know they must be buggin\nThey better hit the streets and do their own muggin\nBut in this case, you would just overlook her\nSend her on her way and say I can't help you hooker\n\n[Chorus]\n\n{*Cool

single\nAnd when you hear this story you'll say it's aight though\nYo yo yo yo Cool V, why don't you give me a cue\nOne more cue, and then I'm ready to go in\n\n[Verse One]\nDon't you like when the winter's gone\nAnd all of a sudden it starts gettin warm\nThe trees and the grass start lookin fresh\nAnd the sun and sky be lookin their best\nBirds be singin, flowers be bloomin\nA lot of brand new cars be zoomin\nFly girls lookin the best they can be\nAnd the guys be dukey dukey Dan you see\nBesides all that I like the warm weather\nCause that's when you can get yourself together\nBut I like Easter time with a grin\nCause when I was little we used to go to Coney I-sland\nWe used to eat a lot of stuff like cotton candy\nCause back then, it was like fine and dandy\nYou used to get dressed up in double knits\nAnd your plaid suit jackets, they were the shits\nThe good ol' days, was back then\nAnd the reason I reminisce, cause..\n\n[Chorus: Biz sings - voice slowed down]\nIt's spring again\nEverybody know it's spring again\nTo the girls and boys and people above\nThis is the time to fall in love\n\n[Verse Two]\nNow girls - have you ever broke up with your boyfriend\nAnd you felt that the world was comin to an end\nSittin around the house poutin for no reason\nJust because you thought your man was skeezin\nFor a couple of days, look gloomy and gray\nThinkin about the ol' happy days\nAll of a sudden, the telephone ring\nHe beg for your forgiveness and you know what that brings\nJoy and happiness into your life\nBefore you felt like your heart was stabbed by a knife\nI'm tellin you girls, keep the man that you got\nCause if he cheats, you might need a VD shot\nYou know two wrongs don't make a right\nAnd if you did somethin wrong, don't do the same it's not polite\nPlease don't make this breakin up a trend, BECAUSE.. BECAUSE..\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse Three]\nNow fellas - have you ever met a girl that tried to front\nAnd wanted you to act like you was on a hunt\nI used to see my homeboys frown and fret\nFor a girl that always tryin to play hard to get\nI know I caught it myself, I must admit\nAnd said - anything you want you gotta work hard for it\nMe the Diabolical, be obsessed?\nAnd go after somethin that a girl posess?\nThey're really on yours like a pair of drawers\nThey want you to be like Santa Claus\nThey want drug dealers, and four-wheelers\nTruck jewelry, they expect you to steal her\nSheeeeit, I know they must be buggin\nThey better hit the streets and do their own muggin\nBut in this case, you would just overlook her\nSend her on her way and say I can't help you hooker\n\n[Chorus]\n\n{*Cool V scratches to the end*}"}}, {"title": "Party to the Break-A-Day", "album": "Weekend Warrior", "year": "2003-11-18", "lyrics": "[Biz Markie]\nAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\nOne-two, doin the do\nThis goes out to my man Truck, my man Jerome\nBilal and the whole Long Island crew\nAnd it goes like this\n\nHey how ya doin it's me\nThe incredible unforgettable B\nIzzah give me Rrah K-I, with the E\nI got mo' rhymes than Muhammad Ali\nHey!

my man Paul Sea\nBut this goes out to my man Danny Dan\nThe beat man that makes you understand\nHe want me to tell somethin bout this girl named Kim\nI'ma do it like this\n\n[Verse One]\nWell it was one of those days when nothing's right with the world\nI was half broke, bored, and fed up with my girl\nLookin for somethin to do but wonderin how long\nIt would take for the next thing to go wrong\nSo I decided to hang, go out and ease my mind\nI told myself you would never know what you might find\nI took a hot bubble bath, instead of a shower\nGot rid of \"The Dragon,\" it took me a hour\nDecided on a sweatsuit, Gucci red and white\nSome rings and some ropes, and then I'm on for the night\nThe Gucci sneakers some cologne, I think Aramis\nI look in the mirror and said, \"Biz you look - marvelous!\"\nI jetted out the door, and hailed a taxi\nAnd said \"54 in a hurry,\" and jumped in the backseat\nWe arrived he said, \"$8.50 and that don't count my tip\"\nI said, \"Don't drink and drive -\nGIMME MY CHANGE before I bust ya lip!\"\nThe club was jumpin and word is bond\nI saw girls walkin around with jeans painted on\nSplittin they skirts up the middle, tight leather and lace\nBoth me and Jimmy agree, we're gonna like this place\nTook a seat at the bar, the girl said what are ya drinkin?\nA Coke and a smile child, and slid her a Lincoln\nTook a sip of my four dollars, she looked at me strange\nI said, \"Psych I bet you thought you was gonna keep the change\"\nI made my way through the crowd, it was plain to see\nSame everywhere I go, all eyes on me\nI sat down at the table, and one of the staff\nSaid, \"Ain't you the Biz\" I said, \"Yeah but no autographs\"\nI sat alone in the corner, and sipped my drink\nHappened to look across the room and somebody winked\nI did the only thing the Diabolical could do\nLooked down to see what that I was attached to\nSure enough it was a girl, a sweet female\nHer hair and eyes sparkled like ginger ale\nI looked lower to her lips, her chin and her neck\nAnd fantasized about the rest, then decided to check\nI sent champagne to her table, the waiter asked her name\nHe returned with Kim, and I almost came\nI checked myself and made sure, I looked alright\nAnd told my dick, \"Don't worry - we're fuckin tonight!\"\nThrew her the Kool-Aid smile, and a dash of charm\nI stepped to the lady and tapped her arm\nBut when she turned around, my smile turned to gloom\nShe didn't look none like she looked across the room\nShe had big broad shoulders and her titties was big\nThey were filled with silicone, and her hair was a wig\nShe had more makeup than Boy George and Phyllis Diller\nUgly enough to be a monster in \"Thriller\"\nHad hair on her chest longer than King Spade\nEven though I got a band, I don't need the AIDS\nSo I hurried out and left, she said, \"Please stay\"\nI said, \"Sorry money grip, I don't go that way\"\nSo I stepped out in a hurry, to gather my wits\nAnd thought that's a damn shame, he had nice tits\nAnd that's the last I ever saw of Kim\nYou wanna know why?  Cause she's a he and her's a him\nLike that and-a, like that and-a\nI'm not the man called Dantana\nYou go on and on and on and on and on and on and on\nDon't go to Getty, go to Exxon.. {*echoes*}\n\n[Biz Markie shout outs and ad libs]"}}, {"title": "Things Get a Little Easier", "album": "The Biz Never Sleeps", "year": "1989-10-10", "lyrics": "And yes y'all, yes y'all\nThis is, a different type of dedication\nTo my man Marcus from Kansas City\nBut I'm just tellin ya straight on up\nDon't be messin with no drugs\nWhether you're young, whether you're old\nWhether you're bad, whether you're bold\nDon't mess with it cause it's not for the soul\nAnd we gonna do it a little somethin\nWith three subjects like this..\n\n[Biz Markie]\nSubject one is about a brother by the name of John\nWho was sellin crack, just like it was Avon\nAnd you know y'know the reason I say \"was\"\nBecause that's no longer what my man John does\nThere was a time when he was wearin much gold\nDrivin a Benz, Jaguar and a Rolls\nThe lifestyle he lived was far from penny ante\nYo-ho-ho-ho-ho, word to granny's panties\nCause he would make dough-roll, and swing it like a yo-yo\nBein broke, was just a no-no\nBut then the day came when John got caught\nAnd he was dropped like pantyhose without support\nYou shoulda thought about, what you did in the past\nTo realize, this fast livin wouldn't last\nBut, the same guy that was a big hoodlum\nIs now in jail, waitin for someone to duke him\n\n[Hook - kids singing 4X]\nThings get a little easier\nOnce you learn to understand it\n\n[Biz Markie]\nSubject two, and this one is a doozy\nA messed up story about a girl named Suzy\nNow when you're on WIC, the problems may seem enough\nBut you know she had to get Scotty to beam her up\nOn a crack mission, no type of ambition\nMake blunts disappear better than a magician\nHer eyes got dim, her body got slim\nShe said there's nothin in the world like a good ol' stem\nOn and like on and, and it was strong\nGrabbed her pipe and sung a song\n\"I want to get HIGH.. so high!\"\n\"I want to get HIGH.. so high!\"\nShe'd go out buy a nice rock just to suit her\nThen hit the weed spot to be blessed by buddha\nBum offa Lucy to complete her stimulation\nPut it all together for a perfect combination\nI mean this girl would actually buy a rock with\nThe very last dime she got in her pocket\nAnd when she saw her friends, comin from the spot\nLike Prudential, she got a piece of their rock\nThat's why\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Biz Markie]\nSubject three, finally, the\nE-N-D about a girl by the name of Marie\nShe used to be hot, most beautiful to the utmost\nI mean this girl was blessed with an overdose\nOf curves, swerves, word to the mother my brother\nAnd boy did the B-I-Z love her\nBut then.. {*singing*} those.. were.. the.. DAYS\nMy friend.. we thought they'd never end\nAnd she looked alright, to the S-K Biz Markie\nBut then she got on drugs\nStarted wearin extensions and rugs\nAnd let me tell you what say happened to Marie\n{*rapping*} because nowadays Marie don't look so hot\nEverytime that I see her, she's headed for the spot\nHer hair is all knotty, got Scotty got her body\nAnd her underarms kickin like the ho know karate\nHer clothes are real dirty, and usually the same\nAs for money she don't have a dime to claim\nBecause when I saw the girl the other day\nShe was puttin a pack of Now-or-Laters on layaway\n\n[Hook] - fades out", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7c84ab3a345d944b61d4c41970988d2c.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Biz Markie", "raw": {"annotation_count": 6, "api_path":

"lyrics": "And yes y'all, yes y'all\nThis is, a different type of dedication\nTo my man Marcus from Kansas City\nBut I'm just tellin ya straight on up\nDon't be messin with no drugs\nWhether you're young, whether you're old\nWhether you're bad, whether you're bold\nDon't mess with it cause it's not for the soul\nAnd we gonna do it a little somethin\nWith three subjects like this..\n\n[Biz Markie]\nSubject one is about a brother by the name of John\nWho was sellin crack, just like it was Avon\nAnd you know y'know the reason I say \"was\"\nBecause that's no longer what my man John does\nThere was a time when he was wearin much gold\nDrivin a Benz, Jaguar and a Rolls\nThe lifestyle he lived was far from penny ante\nYo-ho-ho-ho-ho, word to granny's panties\nCause he would make dough-roll, and swing it like a yo-yo\nBein broke, was just a no-no\nBut then the day came when John got caught\nAnd he was dropped like pantyhose without support\nYou shoulda thought about, what you did in the past\nTo realize, this fast livin wouldn't last\nBut, the same guy that was a big hoodlum\nIs now in jail, waitin for someone to duke him\n\n[Hook - kids singing 4X]\nThings get a little easier\nOnce you learn to understand it\n\n[Biz Markie]\nSubject two, and this one is a doozy\nA messed up story about a girl named Suzy\nNow when you're on WIC, the problems may seem enough\nBut you know she had to get Scotty to beam her up\nOn a crack mission, no type of ambition\nMake blunts disappear better than a magician\nHer eyes got dim, her body got slim\nShe said there's nothin in the world like a good ol' stem\nOn and like on and, and it was strong\nGrabbed her pipe and sung a song\n\"I want to get HIGH.. so high!\"\n\"I want to get HIGH.. so high!\"\nShe'd go out buy a nice rock just to suit her\nThen hit the weed spot to be blessed by buddha\nBum offa Lucy to complete her stimulation\nPut it all together for a perfect combination\nI mean this girl would actually buy a rock with\nThe very last dime she got in her pocket\nAnd when she saw her friends, comin from the spot\nLike Prudential, she got a piece of their rock\nThat's why\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Biz Markie]\nSubject three, finally, the\nE-N-D about a girl by the name of Marie\nShe used to be hot, most beautiful to the utmost\nI mean this girl was blessed with an overdose\nOf curves, swerves, word to the mother my brother\nAnd boy did the B-I-Z love her\nBut then.. {*singing*} those.. were.. the.. DAYS\nMy friend.. we thought they'd never end\nAnd she looked alright, to the S-K Biz Markie\nBut then she got on drugs\nStarted wearin extensions and rugs\nAnd let me tell you what say happened to Marie\n{*rapping*} because nowadays Marie don't look so hot\nEverytime that I see her, she's headed for the spot\nHer hair is all knotty, got Scotty got her body\nAnd her underarms kickin like the ho know karate\nHer clothes are real dirty, and usually the same\nAs for money she don't have a dime to claim\nBecause when I saw the girl the other day\nShe was puttin a pack of Now-or-Laters on layaway\n\n[Hook] - fades out"}}, {"title": "Bodyrock", "album": "Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 Soundtrack", "year": "2003-02-13", "lyrics": "[Intro]\n\nYou know it's ill\nIt's the B-I-Z Markie\nWith my

funk freak-a\nComing right out of your speakers and never reaching the peak-a\nPerfection direction, in any section\nMy style is kicking like Chinese Connection\nMost Valuable Poet, thirteen years strong\nThe island of wrong is where I belong\nSuperb like Goldberg, iller than Godzilla\nI scared Michael Jackson into writing a Thriller\nThe ginger ale sipper, the freestyle flipper\nNever see me in a pair of Grand Union brown clippers\nFunk, what you should pony, down when I was bony\nOne of the funkiest masters of ceremony\nJam, jam, jimmity jam\nLet me, let me, let me, let me tell you who I

clap\nEvery time you see me I'll be doing my thing\nI'm Hello Fried King with the disco flow\nYou know it's satisfaction guaranteed\nIf you're messing with me, you will bleed\nListen to me cause I'm the\nOriginal B e-e-e-e-e\nI, Z, M-A-R-K\nWhen it comes after fries, they're like this is what I'll say\nI'm like super duper dopin' open\nRock the microphone, you'll be scopin'\nKilling the most, coast-to-coast in ya\nI wake up, eat cheese, eggs, and toast\nGuaranteed to rock, I don't got no children\nI just know that I've got to go\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro]", "image":

a story of my situation\nI was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. nation\nThe way that I met her was on tour at a concert\nShe had long hair and a short miniskirt\nI just got on stage drippin', pourin' with sweat\nI was walkin' through the crowd and guess who I met\nI whispered in her ear, \"Come to the picture booth\nSo I can ask you some questions to see if you're hundred proof\"\nI asked her her name, she said, \"Blah-blah-blah\"\nShe had 9/10 pants and a very big bra\nI took a couple of flicks and she was enthused\nI said, \"How do you like the show?\" She said, \"I was very amused\"\nI started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range\nBut when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange\nThen when I asked, \"Do ya have a man?\" She tried to pretend\nShe said, \"No I don't, I only have a friend\"\nCome on, I'm not even goin' for it\nThis is what I'm goin' sing\nYou, you got what I need, but you say he's just a friend\nAnd you say he's just a friend,

I took Blah-blah's word for it at this time\nI thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime\n'Cause I have friends and that's a fact\nLike Agnes, Agatha, Germaine and Jag\nForget about that, let's go into the story\nAbout a girl named Blah-blah-blah that adored me\nSo we started talkin', gettin' familiar\nSpendin' a lot of time so we can build a\nRelationship or some understanding\nHow

pulled to the side\nAt this moment I had to swallow my pride\nCause usually I wouldn't ask for a lift\nBut it was cold as hell, and my legs was stiff\nHe said, \"Hey Biz, what you want, a ride?\"\nI said, \"Hell yeah,\" he said, \"I can't cause my girl's inside\"\nSo he jetted off, leavin two tracks\nNot at one time did homeboy look back\nIt took me an hour, to get where I was goin\nAnd to top it all off, it had to start snowin\nMy sneakers was old, and my coat was thin\nBut my determination kept me goin within\nI had nobody to help me as you can SEE..\n\nI'm alone again, naturally\nAlone again, naturally\n\nSo I went into the show, and started maxin\nPeople came up to me, and started askin\nWhassup wit me, and when I'm gettin on\nAnd how many records is Shante gonna perform\nI don't know, but now I gotta go\nCause Shante is callin me to do the show\nFirst she was on, and then she called me out\nI did a lot of funky beats without no doubt\nI put the mic on my head, and began to riff\nThe crowd began to flip, cause I was rockin the shift\nWhen we was done, I started to laugh\nMassive people come to me for my autograph\nAfter the funk was over it was time to break\nIf I was rhymin it would be the icin on the cake\nAs I saw Shante, get into a limo\nI had to walk home, I wrote it in my memo\n\nI'm alone again, naturally\nAll alone again, naturally\n\nNow I'm a-ight, nothin to worry\nWherever I wanna go, I get there in a hurry\nThat's right I'm big time, very well known\nNow I'm sayin rhymes instead of beats on the microphone\nRight about now, I'm gonna explain\nIt was Cool V, TJ Swan and the Big Daddy Kane\nDoin shows all together, as one group\nNone of us actin big headed, or souped\nThen after that, we all formed a block\nI paid everybody, told them how they rocked\nThey all grabbed they props, and when they seperate\nSwan said, \"I'll see you later Biz, in a couple of days\"\nWhen people see me leave, like a mamma-jamma\nIt's like if I was swoll with stars lights and glamour\nBut when Vaughn came home, he thought I was in somewhere\nWith a girl was in bed.. nah..\n\nAlone again, naturally\nI'm alone again, naturally\n\nAhh ahh..", "image":

"lyrics": "I was on my way, to 125th\nI saw this def Benz, yo that's my man Cliff\nAs I flagged them down, he pulled to the side\nAt this moment I had to swallow my pride\nCause usually I wouldn't ask for a lift\nBut it was cold as hell, and my legs was stiff\nHe said, \"Hey Biz, what you want, a ride?\"\nI said, \"Hell yeah,\" he said, \"I can't cause my girl's inside\"\nSo he jetted off, leavin two tracks\nNot at one time did homeboy look back\nIt took me an hour, to get where I was goin\nAnd to top it all off, it had to start snowin\nMy sneakers was old, and my coat was thin\nBut my determination kept me goin within\nI had nobody to help me as you can SEE..\n\nI'm alone again, naturally\nAlone again, naturally\n\nSo I went into the show, and started maxin\nPeople came up to me, and started askin\nWhassup wit me, and when I'm gettin on\nAnd how many records is Shante gonna perform\nI don't know, but now I gotta go\nCause Shante is callin me to do the show\nFirst she was on, and then she called me out\nI did a lot of funky beats without no doubt\nI put the mic on my head, and began to riff\nThe crowd began to flip, cause I was rockin the shift\nWhen we was done, I started to laugh\nMassive people come to me for my autograph\nAfter the funk was over it was time to break\nIf I was rhymin it would be the icin on the cake\nAs I saw Shante, get into a limo\nI had to walk home, I wrote it in my memo\n\nI'm alone again, naturally\nAll alone again, naturally\n\nNow I'm a-ight, nothin to worry\nWherever I wanna go, I get there in a hurry\nThat's right I'm big time, very well known\nNow I'm sayin rhymes instead of beats on the microphone\nRight about now, I'm gonna explain\nIt was Cool V, TJ Swan and the Big Daddy Kane\nDoin shows all together, as one group\nNone of us actin big headed, or souped\nThen after that, we all formed a block\nI paid everybody, told them how they rocked\nThey all grabbed they props, and when they seperate\nSwan said, \"I'll see you later Biz, in a couple of days\"\nWhen people see me leave, like a mamma-jamma\nIt's like if I was swoll with stars lights and glamour\nBut when Vaughn came home, he thought I was in somewhere\nWith a girl was in bed.. nah..\n\nAlone again, naturally\nI'm alone again, naturally\n\nAhh ahh.."}}, {"title": "Hooker Got a Boyfriend", "album": "All Samples Cleared", "year": "1993-06-02", "lyrics": "[Verse One]\nAiyyo here's a tale, about a female I once messed with\nOr better yet, skins that I swung eps with\nFace full of grace, waist shaped like Vanessa Del Rio, oh-me-oh, my but the heffer had\nBig juicy lips, wide hips you had to call fat\nStacked back to mack, yo the hooker was all that\nAnd lots more, and baby girl I had the hots for\nBut I'm really not sure, who she spread the twat for\nHeard it was a kid across town named Hector\nBut I don't give a heck, so I still went and checked her\nOn the down low, he ain't around so\nOut of sight, out of mind, get your coat and let's go\nSo we dipped, hopped in the whip and we was gone\nOff to City Island cause they had it goin on\nTwo yuks a foo, now the mood was set\nCaviar at the bar, Red Star, Moet\nSilk suits, spendin loot like a straight up mack\nWhen I felt somebody finger tappin me on my back\nAnd turn around quick, but before I could begin\nAll I seen was a big mac-10, aiyyo it's her boyfriend\n\n[Hook]\n\"Hooker got a boyfriend!\"\n\"Why do she do this boyfriend?\"\n\"Ohh ahhh.. why do she do this boyfriend?\"\n\n[Verse Two]\nCheck it, yo\nI broke camp, ran like a champ, yep I jetted\nOff to the trunk for the pump, time to set it\nMoney kept screamin some CRAP that I dissed him\nSo I started lettin off {*gunshots*} but I missed him\nHoney got scared, and called the five-oh\nSo yo, you know the half Dukes, time for me to go\nCause I ain't the type to be doin no bid\nFor a dame or a lame-brained punk Spanish kid\nSo I chill, call the hooker up the next day\nShe told me come over yo, bet I'm on my way\nBe there in a sec, yo I'm not too far\nShe said, \"Park around the back so he don't see the car\"\nMet me at the door with a kiss and a smile\nI said, \"Sorry about last night, money kinda wild\"\n\"Umm yeah I know, small thing don't worry\"\nJust show me to your room so we can do this in a hurry\nKissed her from her earlobes down to her chest\nWent for the bellybutton and to hell with the rest\nGot her butt-naked and before a second passed\nI had her on the bed with my fingers up her {ahh!}\nNow she's ready, set for a good steady bangin\nUntil she looked down and seen Moby Dick hangin\nShe told me, \"Take it easy yo trust me just chill\"\nKnowin once I get up in it yo I'm goin for the kill\nSo she spread 'em, thick rich and creamy like mayo\nAiyyo, lay-o, the tip is on the way-o\nPinned her legs back, just about to slide in\nWhen the door burst open {*SLAM*} damn it's her boyfriend!\nDid it again!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse Three]\nNow I'm mad, money done spoiled all the fun\nOn top of that he beefin and he ain't got a gun\nFlippin the jibs, I guess he wanted to brawl\nSo I started hookin all butt-naked and all\nThrew a right, caught money dead in the jaw\nBOOM with the left and his fronts hit the floor\nNow I had him, time to put his head for rest\nSo I beat him unconcious and I started gettin dressed\nHoney all hysterical and screamin all hoarse\nSaid she seen a box car pullin up in the yard\nJust bout to jet, yo guess what I saw\nSome old big black {*HMMM*} bust in the door\n\"Now hold up, what the hell you doin in my house?\nGet your ass off the floor, put your teeth in your mouth\nNow everybody better be gone by the count of one\nLook, better yet, y'all stay right here\nI'm goin to get my gun\"\nNow that's it! Enough is enough, I ain't with it\nI'm catchin mad beef and yo I ain't even hit it\nHoney looked good and yo the buns was fat\nBut ain't a coochie in the whole WORLD worth all that\nSo umm, I got my coat and I was on my way\nThat's when she started breakin down, and beggin me to stay\nKnock it off, it ain't that much beggin in the world\nNext time I want some skins, I'll go and hit my own girl\nMan I'm out, and I ain't tryin to see you again\nSo eff you, eff your pops AND YOUR FAGGOT-ASS BOYFRIEND!\n\n..\n\n[Hook] - repeat 2X to fade", "image":

boyfriend\n\n[Hook]\n\"Hooker got a boyfriend!\"\n\"Why do she do this boyfriend?\"\n\"Ohh ahhh.. why do she do this boyfriend?\"\n\n[Verse Two]\nCheck it, yo\nI broke camp, ran like a champ, yep I jetted\nOff to the trunk for the pump, time to set it\nMoney kept screamin some CRAP that I dissed him\nSo I started lettin off {*gunshots*} but I missed him\nHoney got scared, and called the five-oh\nSo yo, you know the half Dukes, time for me to go\nCause I ain't the type to be doin no bid\nFor a dame or a lame-brained punk Spanish kid\nSo I chill, call the hooker up the next day\nShe told me come over yo, bet I'm on my way\nBe there in a sec, yo I'm not too far\nShe said, \"Park around the back so he don't see the car\"\nMet me at the door with a kiss and a smile\nI said, \"Sorry about last night, money kinda wild\"\n\"Umm yeah I know, small thing don't worry\"\nJust show me to your room so we can do this in a hurry\nKissed her from her earlobes down to her chest\nWent for the bellybutton and to hell with the rest\nGot her butt-naked and before a second passed\nI had her on the bed with my fingers up her {ahh!}\nNow she's ready, set for a good steady bangin\nUntil she looked down and seen Moby Dick hangin\nShe told me, \"Take it easy yo trust me just chill\"\nKnowin once I get up in it yo I'm goin for the kill\nSo she spread 'em, thick rich and creamy like mayo\nAiyyo, lay-o, the tip is on the way-o\nPinned her legs back, just about to slide in\nWhen the door burst open {*SLAM*} damn it's her boyfriend!\nDid it again!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse Three]\nNow I'm mad, money done spoiled all the fun\nOn top of that he beefin and he ain't got a gun\nFlippin the jibs, I guess he wanted to brawl\nSo I started hookin all butt-naked and all\nThrew a right, caught money dead in the jaw\nBOOM with the left and his fronts hit the floor\nNow I had him, time to put his head for rest\nSo I beat him unconcious and I started gettin dressed\nHoney all hysterical and screamin all hoarse\nSaid she seen a box car pullin up in the yard\nJust bout to jet, yo guess what I saw\nSome old big black {*HMMM*} bust in the door\n\"Now hold up, what the hell you doin in my house?\nGet your ass off the floor, put your teeth in your mouth\nNow everybody better be gone by the count of one\nLook, better yet, y'all stay right here\nI'm goin to get my gun\"\nNow that's it! Enough is enough, I ain't with it\nI'm catchin mad beef and yo I ain't even hit it\nHoney looked good and yo the buns was fat\nBut ain't a coochie in the whole WORLD worth all that\nSo umm, I got my coat and I was on my way\nThat's when she started breakin down, and beggin me to stay\nKnock it off, it ain't that much beggin in the world\nNext time I want some skins, I'll go and hit my own girl\nMan I'm out, and I ain't tryin to see you again\nSo eff you, eff your pops AND YOUR FAGGOT-ASS BOYFRIEND!\n\n..\n\n[Hook] - repeat 2X to fade"}}, {"title": "A One Two", "album": "Make the Music with Your Mouth, Biz EP", "year": "1986-01-01", "lyrics": "A one two, a one two\nA one two, a one two\nI'd like to introduce myself\nMy name is Biz Markie\nMy MC name is Shan\nAnd Shant\u00e9\nAnd TJ Swan\nMy DJ is Marley Marl\nWe down with Mr. Magic\nMy manager's Fly Ty\nWe came to rock for Brooklyn\nAnd Queens\nAnd Manhattan\nAnd the Bronx\nAnd Staten Island\nI can't forget New Jersey\nAnd Long Island\nAnd all over the world\nWe came to rock for everybody, uh like this\n\nGet up, get on up [3x]\n\nWhat goes up\nMust come down\nYou are amazed\nBy how I do the sound\nI'm, the, human orchestraaa\n\n*Biz beatboxes*\n\n[Biz talking while tapping his throat]\nMy name is the Biz Markie\n\n*more beatboxing until end*", "image": "https://images.genius.com/eed2621938d092641c2c579db0255381.550x554x1.jpg", "artist": "Biz Markie", "raw": {"annotation_count": 13, "api_path": "/songs/258130", "apple_music_id": "1351286620", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/258130/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "Biz\u2019s beatboxing track first appeared on the B-side of his debut EP Make the Music with Your Mouth, Biz in 1986.

So what? Ewwwww (Repeat 2x)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm a tell you story that's really bugged\nAbout a guy with a Benz and he's dealing drugs\nIn the begining before he got his riches\nHe was so ugly, he gave me the itches\nI mean, if you see him, you think I might be kooky\nBut homeboy looked like, um, God-zooky\nI used to crack and joke and say he looked like a star\nAnd everybody laughed when I said \"Mon-star\"\nI can't laugh now because it's a new decade\nMy guzu-friend got the girls and got it made\nI guess having jewels, having money, having a vehicle\nMakes you sexy, handsome, gorgeous, and adorable\nWhen you're spending money, giving girls what they want\nBehind your back they talk about you say you're ugly and you front\nWhy do you go to bed with someone that you don't like\nJust because they got a nice car like Reverend Ike\nIt would be wrong if he heard what you're thinking\nThinking that he look like, um, Stinking Jenkins\nBut let me tell you a secret, he has ESP\nAnd this is what he whispered in my ear to me\n\n[Hook]\nI'm an ugly nigga, so what?\nJust because I got loot, that's why you give me the butt?\nI'm an ugly nigga, so what? So what? (Repeat 2x)\nLet me tell you how poor I was\n\n[Verse 3]\nDome to the doo, and doo to the dome\nFor the dome I go to school and for the doo I use a comb\nNow people always ask how are these things known\nCause the dome does the doing for things that are done at home\nThat's why I keep a pick in my nappy fro\nAnd for lunch I eat Ragu with my sloppy joe\nBut at night I be starving, like Messy Marvin\nI get cheap and go settle for the White Castle bargain\nThey offer me a lot in the army\nBut I'd rather get it second hand from the Salvation Army\nCause times are getting harder than boot camp\nMan I'm so poor I need to print my face on a food stamp\nSo if my hooptie breaks down, I just have to suffer\nAnd tell Minekie \"I'm not gonna pay a lot for this muffler!\"\nSo I keep clear thoughts as the weeks run\nBut even on the beaches, they call me a beach bum\nSomething ain't right with me, and that really frightens me\nCause nowadays girls don't even like to sprighten me\nSome say I'm embarassing, but I got some comparison\nLike if I was on TV, I would be Oscar Madison\nIs there another like me? Only God knows\nMan I should even rap in church cause I wear holy clothes\nBut for now I'm just going to do the strut\nAnd this is what I say to girls from houses to huts\n\n[Hook]\nI'm an ugly nigga, so what?\nJust because I'm poor, that's why you won't give me the butt?\nI'm an ugly nigga, so what?

"lyrics": "[Intro]\nHey hey hey, know what I heard?\nBeauty's only skin deep, ugly is to the bone\n\n[Verse 1]\nBack in the days, I'm not gonna lie\nThey used to say I'm ugly, a hurting guy\nThey would crack on my lips, and my powder\nSaying I look like yuck without the house or ?Wig Howard?\n]From junior high to high school they thought I was retarded\nJust because the way I looked, they said I farted\nI was very very sad and you wonder why\nBecause my looks and my gear wasn't ultra fly\nI wouldn't even attempt to ask a girl out\nCause she get around her friends and began to shout\"\n\"Guess who asked me out to the movies girlfriend\nIt was Mark, I told him if the world would end\"\nBut my parents told me beauty's only skin deep\nIf that's true then why do girls think that I'm a creep?\nI even joined the football team to get some recognition\nBut that didn't spark the key in a girl's ignition\nThey said I'm so ugly I give Anican a headache\nAw man, that is the icing on the cake!\nSo I kick this to all the girls from houses to huts\nI don't care what you think, cause you all are nuts\n\n[Hook]\nI'm an ugly nigga, so what?\nIf you don't like the way I look, you can kiss my butt\nI'm an ugly nigga, so what? So what? Ewwwww (Repeat 2x)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm a tell you story that's really bugged\nAbout a guy with a Benz and he's dealing drugs\nIn the begining before he got his riches\nHe was so ugly, he gave me the itches\nI mean, if you see him, you think I might be kooky\nBut homeboy looked like, um, God-zooky\nI used to crack and joke and say he looked like a star\nAnd everybody laughed when I said \"Mon-star\"\nI can't laugh now because it's a new decade\nMy guzu-friend got the girls and got it made\nI guess having jewels, having money, having a vehicle\nMakes you sexy, handsome, gorgeous, and adorable\nWhen you're spending money, giving girls what they want\nBehind your back they talk about you say you're ugly and you front\nWhy do you go to bed with someone that you don't like\nJust because they got a nice car like Reverend Ike\nIt would be wrong if he heard what you're thinking\nThinking that he look like, um, Stinking Jenkins\nBut let me tell you a secret, he has ESP\nAnd this is what he whispered in my ear to me\n\n[Hook]\nI'm an ugly nigga, so what?\nJust because I got loot, that's why you give me the butt?\nI'm an ugly nigga, so what? So what? (Repeat 2x)\nLet me tell you how poor I was\n\n[Verse 3]\nDome to the doo, and doo to the dome\nFor the dome I go to school and for the doo I use a comb\nNow people always ask how are these things known\nCause the dome does the doing for things that are done at home\nThat's why I keep a pick in my nappy fro\nAnd for lunch I eat Ragu with my sloppy joe\nBut at night I be starving, like Messy Marvin\nI get cheap and go settle for the White Castle bargain\nThey offer me a lot in the army\nBut I'd rather get it second hand from the Salvation Army\nCause times are getting harder than boot camp\nMan I'm so poor I need to print my face on a food stamp\nSo if my hooptie breaks down, I just have to suffer\nAnd tell Minekie \"I'm not gonna pay a lot for this muffler!\"\nSo I keep clear thoughts as the weeks run\nBut even on the beaches, they call me a beach bum\nSomething ain't right with me, and that really frightens me\nCause nowadays girls don't even like to sprighten me\nSome say I'm embarassing, but I got some comparison\nLike if I was on TV, I would be Oscar Madison\nIs there another like me? Only God knows\nMan I should even rap in church cause I wear holy clothes\nBut for now I'm just going to do the strut\nAnd this is what I say to girls from houses to huts\n\n[Hook]\nI'm an ugly nigga, so what?\nJust because I'm poor, that's why you won't give me the butt?\nI'm an ugly nigga, so what? So what?

I'm very confused\nI'm stuck in the middle of the Young Girl Bluez\n\n[Hook x4]\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow I was seeing her for about half a year\nEverything was fine and dandy without shedding a tear\nAge ain't nothing but a number, that's what Chi-Ali said\nOkay, then why don't you get that through the judge's head?\nProceeding along, I must have to say\nIt was coming very close to her birthday\nI asked \"What do you want?\" She said \"A pair of earrings\"\nI never knew what an avalanche the future brings\nHer birthday came and she gave a party\nI arrived kind of late to the place to be\nPeople was excited for seeing my face\nIf my mother ever knew, I would be a disgrace\n\"How old are you now?\" to Rhumba-reen\nI was in shock when they screamed \"Sixteen!\"\nI felt like falling apart when I heard the news\nThis is the never-ending saga of the Young Girl Bluez\n\n[Hook x4]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9703d795ec6c8c350b9674639f3fa5b8.500x500x1.jpg", "artist": "Biz Markie", "raw":

I'm very confused\nI'm stuck in the middle of the Young Girl Bluez\n\n[Hook x4]\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow I was seeing her for about half a year\nEverything was fine and dandy without shedding a tear\nAge ain't nothing but a number, that's what Chi-Ali said\nOkay, then why don't you get that through the judge's head?\nProceeding along, I must have to say\nIt was coming very close to her birthday\nI asked \"What do you want?\" She said \"A pair of earrings\"\nI never knew what an avalanche the future brings\nHer birthday came and she gave a party\nI arrived kind of late to the place to be\nPeople was excited for seeing my face\nIf my mother ever knew, I would be a disgrace\n\"How old are you now?\" to Rhumba-reen\nI was in shock when they screamed \"Sixteen!\"\nI felt like falling apart when I

diarrhea\nI always come out with a funky fresh idea\nEven if you don't think it's funky fresh, and\nTo all the little kids I'm makin a good impression\nCause a lot of my hits are written on the john\nI hope my legendary style of rap lives on\nThis's a hidden secret where classics come from\nEverybody has done it, even my man Run\nOnly in there I am the king of the throne\nHey, hey, you know I can't be alone\nNo girls, no guys, no dogs, no cats\nNo parents, no nieces, no nephews, no brats\nThat's the only way that I can get privacy\nAnd you know where I write my funky fresh rhymes live, you see...\n\nMe sittin on a toilet\nWaitin for my bowels to move\nI got a doodoo rap\nI got a doodoo...\n\nYo, bust it\nLet me tell you a little something bout this episode\nIt was four in the morning, chillin on my commode\nIt was me, my pad, and pen, and my bad breath\nAll of a sudden I came up with somethin that was real def\nI was thinkin, what a real beatbox could do\nWhat if I put a hype beat with the \"p-pf 1-2\"?\nThen I write some words, so I really can use it\nI think I would name this one Make The Music\nLike if I was the man that they call Clark Kent\nCause I go into the bathroom for rhymes I invent\nThen I come out on stage like Superman\nBut never show the people my masterplan\nInstead of movin towels, or movin vowels\nOnly think I'm doin, is movin bowels\nA tv in the bathroom just might spoil it\nOnly thing I can say is...\n\nI'm sittin on a toilet\nWaitin for my bowels to move\nI got a doodoo rap\nI got a

around\n\nSittin here reminiscin back to high school\nWwhen everytime I see you, girl, you know that I drool\nDay-dreamin in class thinkin what would I say\nWhen I saw you, but you never looked my way\nIt started freshman year and lasted straight to the 12th grade\nI have to give it to you, though, you was top-shelf, babe\nI asked myself time and time again: what was it\nAbout me that made me treat me like a buzzard\nI speak to you in the hall and you ignore me\nYou keep walkin and talkin like you never saw me\nYou didn't have to conversate with me, I can say that\nIt woulda made my day if you just had waved back\nI used to buy you candy, lollypops and gum drops\nI even pack a extra-sandwich in my lunch box\nYou're treatin me like dirt and everyone in the school knows\nYou call me out my name and crack jokes on my school clothes\nIf anyone could make you feel good, girl, I could\nBut you give me that look like you don't wanna be bothered\nBut that's okay, just keep on frontin, see\nCause one day I'mma make it, and you'll be wantin me\nBeen tryin hard ever since I graduated\nTo make it big, and yes, I finally made it\nBeen doin shows, videos and tv\nNow everywhere you go everybody knows me\nNow the tables have turned and now it's me you're hawkin\nNow I turn up my nose, and keep on walkin\nYou see, ladies marvel me in clubs frequently\nAnd you make it your duty to come and speak to me\nRememberin how she played me in the past\nYeah, we can talk, I'm in a rush, please make it fast\nAnd we can start off with all the men you been with\nAnd don't come poppin that just-a-friend bit\nRemember how you used to diss me and play me out, how\nCome you got so much stuff to talk about now?\nThe word's around town that you're on the money tip\nBut sorry, I can't do nothin for ya, honey dip\nSo pardon me as I make my way to the dancefloor\nAnd over to the bar because that's what I came for\nCuties pamperin me with champagne and roses\nAs I think to myself: thank God for showbiz!\nEverywhere I turn girlies throwin me rhythm\nDrinkin and thinkin who will be my victim\nHere comes that girl that used to diss me\nShe whispers in my ear could she come home with me\nYup, get your coat and we could shoot north\nTook her to the crib, and cold knocked her boots off\nAfter i got it, yo, I never did call back\nThinkin how she used to front like she was all that\nIt's a new game, and the odds are in my favor\nShe caught the vapors and nothin could save her\n\nWhat comes around goes around\nYou know what I'm talkin about\nWhat comes around goes

school\nWwhen everytime I see you, girl, you know that I drool\nDay-dreamin in class thinkin what would I say\nWhen I saw you, but you never looked my way\nIt started freshman year and lasted straight to the 12th grade\nI have to give it to you, though, you was top-shelf, babe\nI asked myself time and time again: what was it\nAbout me that made me treat me like a buzzard\nI speak to you in the hall and you ignore me\nYou keep walkin and talkin like you never saw me\nYou didn't have to conversate with me, I can say that\nIt woulda made my day if you just had waved back\nI used to buy you candy, lollypops and gum drops\nI even pack a extra-sandwich in my lunch box\nYou're treatin me like dirt and everyone in the school knows\nYou call me out my name and crack jokes on my school clothes\nIf anyone could make you feel good, girl, I could\nBut you give me that look like you don't wanna be bothered\nBut that's okay, just keep on frontin, see\nCause one day I'mma make it, and you'll be wantin me\nBeen tryin hard ever since I graduated\nTo make it big, and yes, I finally made it\nBeen doin shows, videos and tv\nNow everywhere you go everybody knows me\nNow the tables have turned and now it's me you're hawkin\nNow I turn up my nose, and keep on walkin\nYou see, ladies marvel me in clubs frequently\nAnd you make it your duty to come and speak to me\nRememberin how she played me in the past\nYeah, we can talk, I'm in a rush, please make it fast\nAnd we can start off with all the men you been with\nAnd don't come poppin that just-a-friend bit\nRemember how you used to diss me and play me out, how\nCome you got so much stuff to talk about now?\nThe word's around town that you're on the money tip\nBut sorry, I can't do nothin for ya, honey dip\nSo pardon me as I make my way to the dancefloor\nAnd over to the bar because that's what I came for\nCuties pamperin me with champagne and roses\nAs I think to myself: thank God for showbiz!\nEverywhere I turn girlies throwin me rhythm\nDrinkin and thinkin who will be my victim\nHere comes that girl that used to diss me\nShe whispers in my ear could she come home with me\nYup, get your coat and we could shoot north\nTook her to the crib, and cold knocked her boots off\nAfter i got it, yo, I never did call back\nThinkin how she used to front like she was all that\nIt's a new game, and the odds are in my favor\nShe caught the vapors and nothin could save her\n\nWhat comes around goes around\nYou know what I'm talkin about\nWhat comes around goes around\nWhat comes around goes around\nWhat comes around goes around"}},

it's time for them to get recognized\nThis is my version of the Nobel Peace Prize\nThat's why I'm comin out my face like this\nFar as negativity, you never get dissed\nIf it wasn't for you, nobody would know\nThat's why this is something for the radiohhhh\n\n[Verse Two]\nThis rhyme is dedicated to the radio DJ's\nThat play all the hits on seven days\nAnd even on the weekends, the DJ's will be freakin\nWithout a doubt because everyone is unique-and\nThe way they cut the records, and be talkin\nIt sound doo doo EXTRA CRAZY DEF on the Walkman\nTo all the disc jockey's that's on the go\nThis is something for the radiohhhh\n\n{*Biz ad libbing a harmony of \"for the radio\" randomly*}\n\nNow I'ma kick it like this\n\n[Verse Three]\nI'd like to thank all the people state to state\nFor requestin my records on the radio great-ly\nAppreciate what you've done for me\nAnd my reward to you is my M-U-S-I-C\nStraight up, I make the music just for you\nSo you can do the extra crazy Biz Mark dance too\nOr even do the dance made up by yourself\nAs long as you're in good phy-sical health\nBecause you're the one that make the radio hype\nLike fresh tobacco and a brand new pipe\nA program director always pick the right hits\nLike puttin some salt and pepper and butter on grits\nI ALWAYS look up to program directors\nCause they're the ones, the jam selectors\nA couple of years ago when I didn't have a record player\nOn the radio I thought to myself sayin\nIf I ever get the chance to playin my stuff\nI'm gonna make everything extra tough\nCause radio will last to infinity\nAs long as my name is the B-I-Z\nEmmezah-A-R-K and I'm hear to say\nNumber one entertainment form in the like U.S.A\nCause if it wasn't for you, nobody would know\nThat's why this is something for the radiohhhh\n\n{*Biz ad libbing a harmony of \"for the radio\" and singing shoutouts*}\n\n[Verse Four]\nThis is the conclusion of just the beginnin\nOf hip-hop on the radio, mix never endin\nStory and fightin, just to get the right and\nHave our respect on a station that's excitin\nIn about two years, I will be a superstar\nBe able to buy anything I want, even a car\nCause if it wasn't for you, nobody would know\nThat's why this is something for the radiohhhh\n\nYo I'd just like to say it like this\n\n{*Cool V scratches to fade*}", "image":

she\nBe-cause it's time for them to get recognized\nThis is my version of the Nobel Peace Prize\nThat's why I'm comin out my face like this\nFar as negativity, you never get dissed\nIf it wasn't for you, nobody would know\nThat's why this is something for the radiohhhh\n\n[Verse Two]\nThis rhyme is dedicated to the radio DJ's\nThat play all the hits on seven days\nAnd even on the weekends, the DJ's will be freakin\nWithout a doubt because everyone is unique-and\nThe way they cut the records, and be talkin\nIt sound doo doo EXTRA CRAZY DEF on the Walkman\nTo all the disc jockey's that's on the go\nThis is something for the radiohhhh\n\n{*Biz ad libbing a harmony of \"for the radio\" randomly*}\n\nNow I'ma kick it like this\n\n[Verse Three]\nI'd like to thank all the people state to state\nFor requestin my records on the radio great-ly\nAppreciate what you've done for me\nAnd my reward to you is my M-U-S-I-C\nStraight up, I make the music just for you\nSo you can do the extra crazy Biz Mark dance too\nOr even do the dance made up by yourself\nAs long as you're in good phy-sical health\nBecause you're the one that make the radio hype\nLike fresh tobacco and a brand new pipe\nA program director always pick the right hits\nLike puttin some salt and pepper and butter on grits\nI ALWAYS look up to program directors\nCause they're the ones, the jam selectors\nA couple of years ago when I didn't have a record player\nOn the radio I thought to myself sayin\nIf I ever get the chance to playin my stuff\nI'm gonna make everything extra tough\nCause radio will last to infinity\nAs long as my name is the B-I-Z\nEmmezah-A-R-K and I'm hear to say\nNumber one entertainment form in the like U.S.A\nCause if it wasn't for you, nobody would know\nThat's why this is something for the radiohhhh\n\n{*Biz ad libbing a harmony of \"for the radio\" and singing shoutouts*}\n\n[Verse Four]\nThis is the conclusion of just the beginnin\nOf hip-hop on the radio, mix never endin\nStory and fightin, just to get the right and\nHave our respect on a station that's excitin\nIn about two years, I will be a superstar\nBe able to buy anything I want, even a car\nCause if it wasn't for you, nobody would know\nThat's why this is something for the radiohhhh\n\nYo I'd just like to say it like this\n\n{*Cool V scratches to fade*}"}}, {"title": "The Dragon", "album": "The Biz Never Sleeps", "year": "1989-10-10", "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Biz Markie]\nNow this is a difficult subject\nAbout something that's crazy - oh, what the heck\nThey know they have something that people don't like\nAnd they still continue to disrespect\nThe thing I'm talking about is an essence\nA foreign fragrance with a presence\nThat you can't see with the naked eye\nBut to the nose it's a nuisance\n\nIt comes in so many forms, it's camouflaged\nAnd it will sneak upon you like espionage\nYou might not know it cause it won't show it\nAnd you will swear it's just a mirage\nIt can be with you when you're talking\nIt will be so close, you think it's hawking\nWith a bit of a twang it got its own slang\nIs even known in New York, and\n\nEverybody know what I'm saying\nFrom here to the Himalayan\nIf you don't know, you must be doo-doo\nThis is what I'm saying\nAbout the dragon\n\n[Verse 2: Biz Markie]\nI think I should go more into depth\nAbout a secret that is quiet as kept\nIf you have it like Richochet Rabbit\nIt can ruin your rep\nThere are ways of preventing this\nCheck your hygiene and your dentist\nYou might think I'm messing, but this is a lesson\nGodliness is cleanliness\n\nBut if you think I'm misguiding you\nBy saying there's something inside of you\nThat bothers everybody when you're at a party\nAnd your reactions to it is: \"pee you!\"\nYou're sitting there baffled and puzzled\nWhatever you have, you wish you was muzzled\nBut if you want a clue, between me and you\nIt could be the beverage you guzzled\n\nBut if you listen to me\nThe diabolical energetical B\nThe I-Z Mza-Mza-A-R-K-I-E\nI'm tryina give you H-E-L-P\n\nSo I'ma end it off like this\nBefore you give somebody a kiss\nFor the one you adore, check them before\nYou get a crazy whiff\nOf the dragon\n\n[Verse 3: Biz Markie]\nI once knew a guy by the name of Tock\nHe was one of them kids from like around the block\nThe kid was cool, had the right gear, and slim\nThe only thing was wrong, he smelled like a gym\nHis secret telling rumors, his right guard went left\nAnd his band was playing a song that was funky to def\nHe was kicking like Bruce Lee and Jim Kelly\nWord is bond, that kid was smelly\nEven if he would shower and shower\nA sprinkle a day, wouldn't last for a hour\nHe would always wanna like hang around\nHis underarms had bass with Sensurround\nI tried to tell him, but he just wouldn't listen\nHe thought from my heart I was trying to diss him\nI started beating around the bush cause he thought I was nagging\nI said, \"Yo Tock, you got the dragon!\"",

"lyrics": "[Verse 1: Biz Markie]\nNow this is a difficult subject\nAbout something that's crazy - oh, what the heck\nThey know they have something that people don't like\nAnd they still continue to disrespect\nThe thing I'm talking about is an essence\nA foreign fragrance with a presence\nThat you can't see with the naked eye\nBut to the nose it's a nuisance\n\nIt comes in so many forms, it's camouflaged\nAnd it will sneak upon you like espionage\nYou might not know it cause it won't show it\nAnd you will swear it's just a mirage\nIt can be with you when you're talking\nIt will be so close, you think it's hawking\nWith a bit of a twang it got its own slang\nIs even known in New York, and\n\nEverybody know what I'm saying\nFrom here to the Himalayan\nIf you don't know, you must be doo-doo\nThis is what I'm saying\nAbout the dragon\n\n[Verse 2: Biz Markie]\nI think I should go more into depth\nAbout a secret that is quiet as kept\nIf you have it like Richochet Rabbit\nIt can ruin your rep\nThere are ways of preventing this\nCheck your hygiene and your dentist\nYou might think I'm messing, but this is a lesson\nGodliness is cleanliness\n\nBut if you think I'm misguiding you\nBy saying there's something inside of you\nThat bothers everybody when you're at a party\nAnd your reactions to it is: \"pee you!\"\nYou're sitting there baffled and puzzled\nWhatever you have, you wish you was muzzled\nBut if you want a clue, between me and you\nIt could be the beverage you guzzled\n\nBut if you listen to me\nThe diabolical energetical B\nThe I-Z Mza-Mza-A-R-K-I-E\nI'm tryina give you H-E-L-P\n\nSo I'ma end it off like this\nBefore you give somebody a kiss\nFor the one you adore, check them before\nYou get a crazy whiff\nOf the dragon\n\n[Verse 3: Biz Markie]\nI once knew a guy by the name of Tock\nHe was one of them kids from like around the block\nThe kid was cool, had the right gear, and slim\nThe only thing was wrong, he smelled like a gym\nHis secret telling rumors, his right guard went left\nAnd his band was playing a song that was funky to def\nHe was kicking like Bruce Lee and Jim Kelly\nWord is bond, that kid was smelly\nEven if he would shower and shower\nA sprinkle a day, wouldn't last for a hour\nHe would always wanna like hang around\nHis underarms had bass with Sensurround\nI tried to tell him, but he just wouldn't listen\nHe thought from my heart I was trying to diss him\nI started beating around the bush cause he thought I was nagging\nI said, \"Yo Tock, you got the dragon!\""}}, {"title": "She's Not Just Another Woman (Monique)", "album": "The Biz Never Sleeps", "year": "1989-10-10", "lyrics": "[Verse One]\nI once knew a girl by the name of Monique\nShe was my childhood sweetheart every day of the week\nWhether PS46, or 151\nAfter school I'd go to her house, to have some fun\nWe both lived in Colonial Projects\nI lived in building 48, she lived in building 26\nWe used to play Ringling, Coke or 1-2-3\nBut when I'm in Monique's presence, I would just freeze\nThe relationship began when I was five startin\nShe was in nursery school, I was in kindergarten\nWe was more closer than a hand and glove\nThis is what you call real puppy love\nWhen we'd go trick or treating, I would carry her bag\nWhen we moved to Long Island, it was all such a drag\nCause I know it would be difficult to see her again\nI wouldn't miss her more than I'd miss all of my friends\nEven though we was little this love was unique\nAnd this is what I say to my love Monique, because\n\n[Chorus - repeat 4X]\n\"She's not, just another woman..\nShe's not, no no!\"\n\n[Verse Two]\nLet me tell ya a little somethin, about Monique\nEven though we was little she had a physique\nIndian brown skin with a nice complexion\nShe always gave me tender love and affection\nI knew she was different in her own little way\nI used to knock at her door bout every single day\nI remember when we used to go trick or treatin\nI used to snatch bags, so she could sink her teeth in\nCrazy big variety of a lot of candy\nShe would share it with her friends Kim Ron and Fran and\nLee-nette, the girl she called her cousin\nWe never had an argument, oh we was never fussin\nThat's why me and her got along so good\nAnything I asked her to do, you know she would\nWe would have family day, in back of building 70\nI would win her a prize, so she could treat me heavenly\nI don't care what nobody say, because\nThis girl would make my day, and\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse Three]\nNow this is the epilogue of this story\nAbout a young little girl, especially for me\nNo matter how many years ago I can't forget\nBut then again 1986 hit\nShe looked just the same, but in a bigger version\nMy mind started goin on a love excursion\nI started reminiscin to her bout old times\nShe began to smile, I guess I rang her chimes\nI didn't see her again until 1988\nAnd I saw her again, and she still was straight\nNow this time I had enough courage to speak to her\nI told her would you be with me, and what would occur\nThen I asked was, she swingin any capers\nShe said - no not me, nobody got no papers\nI couldn't believe, after all of these years\nI was so happy she waited it brought me to tears, cause\n\n[Chorus] - quickly fades out", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7c84ab3a345d944b61d4c41970988d2c.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Biz

repeat 4X]\n\"She's not, just another woman..\nShe's not, no no!\"\n\n[Verse Two]\nLet me tell ya a little somethin, about Monique\nEven though we was little she had a physique\nIndian brown skin with a nice complexion\nShe always gave me tender love and affection\nI knew she was different in her own little way\nI used to knock at her door bout every single day\nI remember when we used to go trick or treatin\nI used to snatch bags, so she could sink her teeth in\nCrazy big variety of a lot of candy\nShe would share it with her friends Kim Ron and Fran and\nLee-nette, the girl she called her cousin\nWe never had an argument, oh we was never fussin\nThat's why me and her got along so good\nAnything I asked her to do, you know she would\nWe would have family day, in back of building 70\nI would win her a prize, so she could treat me heavenly\nI don't care what nobody say, because\nThis girl would make my day, and\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse Three]\nNow this is the epilogue of this story\nAbout a young little girl, especially for me\nNo matter how many years ago I can't forget\nBut then again 1986 hit\nShe looked just the same, but in a bigger version\nMy mind started goin on a love excursion\nI started reminiscin to her bout old times\nShe began to smile, I guess I rang her chimes\nI didn't see her again until 1988\nAnd I saw her again, and she still was straight\nNow this time I had enough courage to speak to her\nI told her would you be with me, and what would occur\nThen I asked was, she swingin any capers\nShe said - no not me, nobody got no papers\nI couldn't believe, after all of these years\nI was so happy she waited it brought me to tears, cause\n\n[Chorus] - quickly fades out"}}, {"title": "D.P.", "album": "Friends EP", "year": null, "lyrics": "[INTRO:

Markie]\nThis is a different type of dedication\nTo a guy that was a different kind of inspiration\nOnly people that knew him, know what I'm talkin about\nAnd at the end of the story, you will say without a doubt\nThis wasn't your typical case, of fast livin\nAnything he was makin, he was givin\nTo his moms, pops, his brother and his girl\nCause they, meant, the most to him in the world\nAround Suffolk he wasn't known\nBut in Eastern Long Island, he did have a home\nCalled L.I., is where he stayed\nWhere there was no need for D-Con or Raid\nHe was cool with everybody, he had no enemies\nI'm makin this record, cause he's a friend of me\nCause he's a hard workin kid, I've just stated\nThat's why this record, is dedicated\nTo my man Rich\n\nYo yo, this is for you my man\nGod bless you\n\n[Verse Two]\nLet me tell you what happened in the early 80's\nWhen we wasn't thinkin about gettin all the ladies\nMe and Rich was thinkin about survival of the fittest\nYou can ask Keith or Kevin, cause both of them were with us\nWe'd try to get a job everyplace that it takes\nWe was even at the factory they call {?}\nEverywhere we went they said they'd call us back\nOr even said they're not hirin to throw us off track\nBut Richie Rich said, forget that stuff\nEven though, times was rough\nWe kept searchin searchin lookin and lookin\nIt seems everywhere we went, the jobs was tooken\nStill Rich didn't give up the faith\nHe found a job that wasn't safe\nEven though it was dangerous, it wouldn't switch\nThat's why this is dedicated to my man Rich\n\nYo this is to you my man Rich\nCause you know you go way back, you go way back\nWord up, God bless you\n\n[Verse Three]\nThe way the story end, is just a tragedy\nI wish upon a star that it didn't have to be\nEndin this way for my man Richard\nCause still in my mind, he's still as pictured\nLike, he just had gone yesterday\nFor sellin, C-R-A-C-K\nHis dream was.. to be a boxer\nSo, he could knock the socks off of\nAn Ivan Barkley, or even Mike Tyson\nBut on the streets, he was sacrificin\nFor his family, and his wife\nCause he struggled, he struggled all his life\nHe wasn't a straight up, criminal or villain\nOr even tryin to get, stupid or illin\nWas messed up for takin somebody's life and shit\nThat tried so hard, and just wouldn't quit\nThis is a slow record, with a switch\nBecause it's dedicated, to my man Rich\n\nTo you my man\nThis is to you, Rich\nPeace", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7c84ab3a345d944b61d4c41970988d2c.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Biz Markie", "raw": {"annotation_count": 0,

of inspiration\nOnly people that knew him, know what I'm talkin about\nAnd at the end of the story, you will say without a doubt\nThis wasn't your typical case, of fast livin\nAnything he was makin, he was givin\nTo his moms, pops, his brother and his girl\nCause they, meant, the most to him in the world\nAround Suffolk he wasn't known\nBut in Eastern Long Island, he did have a home\nCalled L.I., is where he stayed\nWhere there was no need for D-Con or Raid\nHe was cool with everybody, he had no enemies\nI'm makin this record, cause he's a friend of me\nCause he's a hard workin kid, I've just stated\nThat's why this record, is dedicated\nTo my man Rich\n\nYo yo, this is for you my man\nGod bless you\n\n[Verse Two]\nLet me tell you what happened in the early 80's\nWhen we wasn't thinkin about gettin all the ladies\nMe and Rich was thinkin about survival of the fittest\nYou can ask Keith or Kevin, cause both of them were with us\nWe'd try to get a job everyplace that it takes\nWe was even at the factory they call {?}\nEverywhere we went they said they'd call us back\nOr even said they're not hirin to throw us off track\nBut Richie Rich said, forget that stuff\nEven though, times was rough\nWe kept searchin searchin lookin and lookin\nIt seems everywhere we went, the jobs was tooken\nStill Rich didn't give up the faith\nHe found a job that wasn't safe\nEven though it was dangerous, it wouldn't switch\nThat's why this is dedicated to my man Rich\n\nYo this is to you my man Rich\nCause you know you go way back, you go way back\nWord up, God bless you\n\n[Verse Three]\nThe way the story end, is just a tragedy\nI wish upon a star that it didn't have to be\nEndin this way for my man Richard\nCause still in my mind, he's still as pictured\nLike, he just had gone yesterday\nFor sellin, C-R-A-C-K\nHis dream was.. to be a boxer\nSo, he could knock the socks off of\nAn Ivan Barkley, or even Mike Tyson\nBut on the streets, he was sacrificin\nFor his family, and his wife\nCause he struggled, he struggled all his life\nHe wasn't a straight up, criminal or villain\nOr even tryin to get, stupid or illin\nWas messed up for takin somebody's life and shit\nThat tried so hard, and just wouldn't quit\nThis is a slow record, with a switch\nBecause it's dedicated, to my man Rich\n\nTo you my man\nThis is to you, Rich\nPeace"}}, {"title": "Let Me Turn You On",

thought she didn't care\nDid you ever feel like cryin, and think you'd get nowhere\nDid you ever see her comin, when the lights were down below\nDid you ever whisper GOD I LOVE HER, but how much you never know\nDid you ever look into her eyes and see a little prayer\nCould you sew a spot, flow to her heart\nAnd think that you were there?\nDid you ever wonder where she is, or wonder if she's true?\nOne day you'll be happy\nBut that next day you'll be blue\n\n[Chorus]\nThat's why I say well (well) - it feels so good to me\nWELLLLL (WELLLLL) - you know just how to set me FREEEEEEE\nSay LET

blow your mind\nTalkin bout a love of the freakiest kind\nBecause you got eyes like a-water\nLips so rosey red\nEverytime I see you really turns my head\nAnd I'm the kind of guy, that love you all for

stoppin\"}\nBrooklyn {\"no stoppin\"}\nQueens {\"no stoppin\"}\nThe Bronx {\"no stoppin\"}\nLong Island {\"no stoppin\"}\nNew Jersey {\"no stoppin, say no stoppin\"}\nYo V, bring it in\nAight, this this a special dedication\nTo my man DJ Hollywood\nBecause he was one of the first ones out there\nAnd I-I-I'd like I'd like to sing a little song\nA little something like this\nTo all the ladies out there, this goes out to you now\nCheck it out\n\n[Verse One: Biz singing]\nOoooh, whoa-whoa\nNo wayyyyyyyyy, no wayyyyyyyy\nFor you to stop me now\nI'm the kind of guy that could really turn you on\nGive you so much lovin, and treat you on\nJust hold me close and hold me tight\nAnd let's make love tonight\nAnd I swear to you baby, I'll treat you right\nIf you're the kind of girl that I've been lookin for\nBe real good to me baby, let me be adored\nI don't stop the way I'm feelin\nJust keep on turnin me on\nAnd I swear to you baby, I'll love you all night long\n\n[Interlude One]\nSomebody say well (well) - WELLLLL! (WELLLLL!)\nThere ain't no way to stop me now, come on\nLet me here you say welll (welll) - oh well (oh well)\nWELLLLLLL-LLLLLLLL-LLLLLLL\n\n[Verse Two: Biz singing]\nDid you ever see a girl, and thought she didn't care\nDid you ever feel like cryin, and think you'd get nowhere\nDid you ever see her comin, when the lights were down below\nDid you ever whisper GOD I LOVE HER, but how much you never know\nDid you ever look into her eyes and see a little prayer\nCould you sew a spot, flow to her heart\nAnd think that you were there?\nDid you ever wonder where she is, or wonder if she's true?\nOne day you'll be happy\nBut that next day you'll be blue\n\n[Chorus]\nThat's why I say well (well) - it feels so good to me\nWELLLLL (WELLLLL) - you know just how to set me FREEEEEEE\nSay LET ME LET ME LET ME LET ME\nLET ME LET ME TURN YOU ON, ooooooooohhhhh\n\nWhenever I see her face (where you goin brotherman?)\nI take a trip to a beautiful plaaaaaaaaace\nSay LET ME LET ME LET ME LET ME\nLET ME LET ME TURN YOU ON, ooooooooohhhhh\n\n[Interlude Two]\nWhenever we're up close\nIt's your perfume I love the mooooooooooost\nSay LET ME LET ME LET ME LET ME\nLET ME LET ME TURN YOU ON, ooooooooohhhhh\n\n[Verse Three: Biz singing]\nWhen all the other fellas try to run that game on you\nI wanna show you baby a love that's true\nA love that's good, and a love that's fine\nSomethin to blow your mind\nTalkin bout a love of the freakiest kind\nBecause you got eyes like a-water\nLips so rosey red\nEverytime I see you really turns my head\nAnd I'm the kind of guy, that love you all for me\nAnd everybody know my name is (BIZ-MAR-KIE)\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Biz singing]\nSay, well, WELLLLLLLLLLLL\nWell, well well welll\nWell, well, well!\nLet me let me turn you on, ooooooooohhhhh\nLet me.. let me turn you on\nPlease baby, let me turn you on\nWelll welll welll welll welll welll\nLet me let me turn you on, ooooooooohhhhh\nYeah, yeahhhhh\nYeah, yeah yeah yeah\nPleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease\nLet me let me turn you on, ooooooooohhhhh"}}, {"title": "Check it Out", "album": "The Biz Never Sleeps", "year": "1989-10-10", "lyrics": "Yo.. this is

beat I'm gonna rock the house\nWhen you hear my golden voice, you know it's me\nThe poetical, energetical rap MC\nWell that's not the subject matter of to be cool\nI'm just tellin you girls and fly kids, stay in school\nI always reminisce when I was in class well\nBut you feel like a simpletone when you get expelled\nOr, even if you have a couple of days in detention\nIt's just as good as one bad suspension\nSo when you're grown up, you'll say the same thing\nTo your kids, be in class before the bell ring\nBut you know, kids is kids\nTo them high school is like a three year bid\nI'm not gonna tell a lie, I used to cut class\nUntil the principal straight got in my ass\nHe said, \"Biz the only way you're gonna get a BM\nIs to get your education instead of hangin with him\"\nSo I got my head together, and chilled the hell out\nAnd now all the break-breakers says is check him out\n\n[Hook]\nCheck him out, check him out, check him out, check him out\nWith the beat I'm gonna rock the house\nCheck him out, check him out, check him out, check him out\nWith the beat I'm gonna rock the house! {*echoes*}\n\n[Verse Two]\nNow this is the second part of this lesson\nI'm sayin it this way cause it's my profession\nYou don't have to go to high school to be an MC\nBut you got to know the value and means, of money\nCause a lot of parents, they are taxpayers\nSo it's real stupid, when you disobey a\nPrincipal, vice principal or even a teacher\nCause when you do that, you know you'll never reach a\nHigher level, or even your goal\nBecause, you don't wanna listen to what you're told\nSo please take heed, to what I say\nI hope I'm not sayin it for my health today\nCause if I am please tell me, so I can stop\nIt's not like I'm your mother sister brother or pop\nSo come on and listen to me without no doubt\nSo you can be educated and have, clout\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse Three]\nI'm just tellin young people to stay away from drugs\nCause if you mess with that it'll make you bug\nWhatever you wanna, like call it, I'm tellin you\nDon't become a drug addict or alcoholic\nBecause it will mess with your mind and brain\nAnd only thing you wanna do is feen and complain\nCause I'm tellin you just like this off the top of my head\nDon't mess with it, cause you will be misled\nBy other people, devils and demons\nI'm Biz Markie, I'm not Alfred Simmons\nI'm just tellin you to do this, without no doubt\nCause I'm the Biz and I got the clout\n\n[Hook]\n\n[ad libs and shout outs]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7c84ab3a345d944b61d4c41970988d2c.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Biz Markie",

check him out, check him out, check him out\nWith the beat I'm gonna rock the house\nCheck him out, check him out, check him out, check him out\nWith the beat I'm gonna rock the house! {*echoes*}\n\n[Verse Two]\nNow this is the second part of this lesson\nI'm sayin it this way cause it's my profession\nYou don't have to go to high school to be an MC\nBut you got to know the value and means, of money\nCause a lot of parents, they are taxpayers\nSo it's real stupid, when you disobey a\nPrincipal, vice principal or even a teacher\nCause when you do that, you know you'll never reach a\nHigher level, or even your goal\nBecause, you don't wanna listen to what you're told\nSo please take heed, to what I say\nI hope I'm not sayin it for my health today\nCause if I am please tell me, so I can stop\nIt's not like I'm your mother sister brother or pop\nSo come on and listen to me without no doubt\nSo you can be educated and have, clout\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse Three]\nI'm just tellin young people to stay away from drugs\nCause if you mess with that it'll make you bug\nWhatever you wanna, like call it, I'm tellin you\nDon't become a drug addict or alcoholic\nBecause it will mess with your mind and brain\nAnd only thing you wanna do is feen and complain\nCause I'm tellin you just like this off the top of my head\nDon't mess with it, cause you will be misled\nBy other people, devils and demons\nI'm Biz Markie, I'm not Alfred Simmons\nI'm just tellin you to do this, without no doubt\nCause I'm the Biz and I got the clout\n\n[Hook]\n\n[ad libs and shout outs]"}},

"Y'all know me as the B-I-Z\nThat roc the microphone most definately\nBringing you styles that you never heard\nLike brother thug like brother nerd\nI'm real super, high in the 80's\nEven Austin Powers'd say \"yeahh baby\"\nThe hip hopper unpredictable showstopper\nWhatever I say, ya know its proper\nCuz when I kick it, I kick it like a field goal\nLike Erik B and Rakim ya know I got soul\nI got funky rhymes that blow your mind\nBuggin you out without a doubt every single time\nI'm cookoo for cocoa with my vocal\nWhen I'm in san francisco or when I'm local\nThe \"M-a forever\"? just doin my thing\nI'm guaranteed to rock and make the microphone sing\n\nChorus\nLadada Ladadada (4x) with scrathing\n\nBiz in charge and, yo I'm livin large and\nOooh I like it like el debarge and\nIn the tune I can croon with a bank and a ?\nSo hurry up and get the sick smokers out the room\nBefore I catch asthma or emphysema\nYou can catch me in a playsport or a beamer\nI rip and rag, play freeze tag\nBut since I got older its all such a drag\nBut it dont matter now like purina cat chow\nThe first beat I did was meow meow meow meow\nDont have a son or daughter even though I oughta\nIts almost ten years since I rocked at the quarters\nRoof top program ? baby what a man\nNow I plays the tunnel ??\nYo paul, let the music cease\nWhen I count to three everybody say peace\n\nChorus til end"}},

roses for you\nYo, I'da I'da I-don't know where he's at Ju-li-et\nDon't regret, cause he will be back\nTo come and get you, and bring you to the crillzab\nBut, there's an obstacle that's in his way\nI think it's the-the-the ? that won't decay\nWell, I'm the B-I-Z-M-izza-A-R-K\nLet me tell you what I hear most people say\nThat you two people are a part of life\nIt explains why Romeo died by the knife\nOr was it - the poison on Juliet lips\nOr vice versa I don't know it make my mind flips\nWhichever way it was, it's very educational\nSo look at the movie and listen cause it's sensational\nAnd if you hear the music you could never go wrong\nI want EVERYBODY sing a long, now come on now\n\n\tRomeo and Juliet get-tin bu-sy (repeat 4X)\n\nTo the R-O-M-E-O, and the J-U-L-I-et\nI think the thing he did was to get respect\nThe way that I see it, it was a great deed\nBecause if wasn't, he wouldn't succeed\nAt getting Juliet's heart, and loving care\nAnd all of the moments they had to share\nBut I really want you just to check out the plot\nOf the movie it is groovy it will hit the spot\nIt will make you laugh, it make you cry\nAnd that's when you know you will be satisfied\nCause you know I wouldn't tell you nuthin that wasn't right\nCause the Diabolical is outta sight\nYo, Romeo and Juliet should be household names\nThey names should be in the hall of fame\nWith my funky beat, you can never go wrong\nI want EVERYBODY sing this song, now bust it out now\n\n\tRomeo and Juliet get-tin bu-sy (repeat 3X)\n\tRomeo, Romeo, HAH!!\n\tRomeo and Juliet get-tin bu-sy (repeat 3X)\n\tRomeo,

he went to get some roses for you\nYo, I'da I'da I-don't know where he's at Ju-li-et\nDon't regret, cause he will be back\nTo come and get you, and bring you to the crillzab\nBut, there's an obstacle that's in his way\nI think it's the-the-the ? that won't decay\nWell, I'm the B-I-Z-M-izza-A-R-K\nLet me tell you what I hear most people say\nThat you two people are a part of life\nIt explains why Romeo died by the knife\nOr was it - the poison on Juliet lips\nOr vice versa I don't know it make my mind flips\nWhichever way it was, it's very educational\nSo look at the movie and listen cause it's sensational\nAnd if you hear the music you could never go wrong\nI want EVERYBODY sing a long, now come on now\n\n\tRomeo and Juliet get-tin bu-sy (repeat 4X)\n\nTo the R-O-M-E-O, and the J-U-L-I-et\nI think the thing he did was to get respect\nThe way that I see it, it was a great deed\nBecause if wasn't, he wouldn't succeed\nAt getting Juliet's heart, and loving care\nAnd all of the moments they had to share\nBut I really want you just to check out the plot\nOf the movie it is groovy it will hit the spot\nIt will make you laugh, it make you cry\nAnd that's when you know you will be satisfied\nCause you know I wouldn't tell you nuthin that wasn't right\nCause the Diabolical is outta sight\nYo, Romeo and Juliet should be household names\nThey names should be in the hall of fame\nWith my funky beat, you can never go wrong\nI want EVERYBODY sing this song, now bust it out now\n\n\tRomeo and Juliet get-tin bu-sy (repeat 3X)\n\tRomeo, Romeo, HAH!!\n\tRomeo and Juliet get-tin bu-sy (repeat 3X)\n\tRomeo, Romeo, HAH!!"}}, {"title": "Just a Freind (Remix from Black-ish)", "album": null, "year": "2017-05-11", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nI'm on it\nI just love co-ed baby

C'mon!!\nWhat happened?? Ahhrrrahhh!!\nRrrrah!\nNow we got me\nMy man Chubb Rock over this Prince Paul beat\nYo Chubb you start it off we gonna freak it\nC'mon\n\nVerse One: Chubb Rock\n\nHere we go\nTo the consumer, and the kids who drop rumors\nFor the man who sport, Timberland and dash suede Pumas\nI, come backwards on stuff you don't deny\nIf you try to act fly then I'll, punk you I and I\nWhen, I turn my ducats into Li Pao Yen\nThe gas from the past of the American friend\nWith your suits and your squads and your fancy car\nTurn to bourgeoise, to invade the media, shame\nTake it insult, call me, the Grape Ape\nWhen I flow people gotta see the whole Ricki Lake\nAte, every cuisine and scheme from Jamaica\nI like Spike Lee's a kind of sporty 40 Acre\nI gotta have it, O.J., he gotta stab it\nStop dealin with that Cato Caelin kid, the drug addict\nIf you missed me, don't kiss me with the tongue\nSoon to come is my man BizMark the one\n\nVerse Two: BizMarkie\n\nLa-dah-di, la-dah-da, I like to say\nYou know me, as the inhuman orchestra\nWhen you first heard me I did MEOW MEOW\nGuaranteed to rock and shock and clock and\nOh, I made you say ow yes\nYou hear me rockin, you hear me clockin\nYou hear people jockin\nIs it because I'm like smart like Mr. Spock and\nCaptain Kirk and, you know I'm workin\nI'm bound to wreck your body, go OWWW, I go bezerk and\nYou always hearin, you always clearin, you always cheerin\nHey, umm, umm I'm dissapearin like Magic\nI'm tragic, all of a sudden\nYou Gotta Have It like Spike Lee, hey, you know me\nAs the Uh-riginal B, I-Z, the M, the A\nThe ickaZarR-Kay, I-E\nI'm not diggedy Das EFX but I can mic check it\nThe original, here to rock and get respected\nI'm Markie, heh, the M-ahh-Zay-R-Kay\nThe man appointed rap King, and I'm here to stay\nI'm down to wreck your body, I'm not here to scrub\nI gotta pass it over, to my man Chubb\n\nVerse Three: Chubb Rock\n\nFrom the glass clear era that's the point of the one\nBe unique, critique, from the crumb, me neva done\nI check them then wreck them let them fall into my spectrum\nThen the Punky Brewster kids they, squeeze like rectum\nI become monolithic then rip it the remains I sip it\nMy hat I tip it, cheerio, kid and here I go\nOff beat slackin, but the platinum mediocre rappers\nWith the corporate backers interfused to grab sag actors\nThe, acoustic suits it, the boys juiced it then boost it\nIt kinda Gravedigs, well it should, Prince Paul produced it\nWhat about bourgeoise, super star, in unleaded fuel cars\nHangin in bars, talkin the trife squads\nGirls buckwild, child, in the rub-a-dub style\nEvery girl love oh Chubb Rock profile, smile\nAt the camera point your gluttimus to the man\nAt the movie star to smack out, with my rubber band\nI can tell that, you need me, you don't want me to get paunchy\nAnd me, I don't want to catch no HIV\nSo we'll protect you, and me but mainly me\nIf you don't want no rubber then P-E-A-C-E"}}, {"title": "Bad by Myself", "album": "All Samples Cleared", "year": "1993-06-02", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nYeah yeah yeah\nOooooohh\nYeahhhhhhhhhhhhh, yeah yeah yeah\nLet me tell you a story now\n\n[Verse One]\nI was in front of the Apollo on Amateur Night\nIt was after the show, and the moon was right\nThe {?} was really perked off the Red Zone\nI was in my MPV, I was all alone\nA lot of out-of-town people askin me for\nMy John Hancock or my signature\nI gave it to, all of them cause I was down to earth\nAnd plus the Apollo is my home turf\nSo I walked across the street 'til I'm on, 125\nI saw this pair of shoes that was really live\nIt wasn't just a pair of shoes, that was on her\nFrom the ground up, she looked like a plate of lasagna\nI said, \"Hey shorty, not you, your hair\"\nShe turned around slowly and started to stare\nShe said, \"Why don'tcha take picture, it'll last a lil' longer?\"\nMe likin you grew a little bit stronger\nShe asked me what's my name I said, \"Emmezah emmezah\"\n\"The name that your momma gave ya is what I prefer\"\nShe asked me what am I drivin, and how is my health\nI know what you're really thinkin baby, LET ME TELL YOU!\n\n[Chorus One - Biz singing]\nI can do bad by myself\nI don't need no help, to starve to death\nI can do that alone\nI can do bad by myself\nI don't need no help, to starve to death\nI ain't tryin to be funny honey\n\n[Verse Two]\nShe started arguin with me, and say she's not like that\nI know who you are, I don't care if you're livin fat\nBecause I have a mother and father that take care of me\nAnd I'm livin in Long Island with a J-O-B\nOkay okay I got you wrong, I must admit\nI'ma give you a little time to see if you're legit\nSo we started goin out on a regular basis\nI was takin her to the movies and my hangout, places\nLike the Q Club, The Scene, or The Arcade\nI thought this relationship was tailor-made\nCause she was sweet kind considerate I, was hypnotized\nNever thought she'd try to pull the wool, over my eyes\nAfter I smacked it and flipped it, she thought I was whipped\nI know she is like a knockout but I'm not gettin bullwhipped\nShe asked me why I am so stingy I know you got the ends\nBecause you got two MV's, two BM's, an SL Benz\nWhat are you my accountant or the IRS?\nWhy ya clockin everything that I posess?\nShe want me to waste everything and be small as an elf\nLet me tell you somethin baby, let me tell you\n\n[Chorus Two - Biz singing]\nI can do bad by myself\nI don't need no help, to starve to death\nI can do that on my own\nI can do bad by myself\nI don't need no help, to starve to death\nI ain't tryin to be funny honey\n\n[Verse Three]\nNow all her friends boosted her, to get my dinero\nLike if I was a drunk Mexican, wearin a sombrero\nI knew she had a boyfriend on the side\nShe told me, yo, she didn't have to hide\nShe said she cut him because he was too jealous\nHe always thought I was tryin to talk to other fellas\nIt's now the present, and that was the past\nFrom now on bein with me, is gonna be a blast\nI know she thought in her mind, it's gonna be great\nJuicin and reducin everything I make\nWith her Victoria's Secrets neglice\nShe tried to seduce me in every way\nShe would come out to Jersey rain sleet or snow\nShe acted too true blue to be after my dough\nMy man, Jeff told me but I didn't wanna listen\nI was too hooked, and strung out, I thought he was dissin\nThen she popped the question, and asked me for some dough\nI looked her in her face and said, \"HELL NO!!!\"\nYou're a head nurse and you want my wealth?\nYou must be CRAZY AS HELL, cause\n\n[Chorus One]\n\n[Biz singing]\nLet me tell you know\nAll day long, you been talkin on the telephone\nBraggin to all your friends, about all the cars that I own\nBut YOUUUUUU don't tell 'em, that I'm the one doin it all\nWhile you're out there livin it up, and havin yo'self a ball\n\n[Chorus Two]\n\n[Biz singing]\nUmmm, whoah-whoah, yeah-yeahhhh!\nI can sing-ing-ing-ing..", "image":

"lyrics": "[Intro]\nYeah yeah yeah\nOooooohh\nYeahhhhhhhhhhhhh, yeah yeah yeah\nLet me tell you a story now\n\n[Verse One]\nI was in front of the Apollo on Amateur Night\nIt was after the show, and the moon was right\nThe {?} was really perked off the Red Zone\nI was in my MPV, I was all alone\nA lot of out-of-town people askin me for\nMy John Hancock or my signature\nI gave it to, all of them cause I was down to earth\nAnd plus the Apollo is my home turf\nSo I walked across the street 'til I'm on, 125\nI saw this pair of shoes that was really live\nIt wasn't just a pair of shoes, that was on her\nFrom the ground up, she looked like a plate of lasagna\nI said, \"Hey shorty, not you, your hair\"\nShe turned around slowly and started to stare\nShe said, \"Why don'tcha take picture, it'll last a lil' longer?\"\nMe likin you grew a little bit stronger\nShe asked me what's my name I said, \"Emmezah emmezah\"\n\"The name that your momma gave ya is what I prefer\"\nShe asked me what am I drivin, and how is my health\nI know what you're really thinkin baby, LET ME TELL YOU!\n\n[Chorus One - Biz singing]\nI can do bad by myself\nI don't need no help, to starve to death\nI can do that alone\nI can do bad by myself\nI don't need no help, to starve to death\nI ain't tryin to be funny honey\n\n[Verse Two]\nShe started arguin with me, and say she's not like that\nI know who you are, I don't care if you're livin fat\nBecause I have a mother and father that take care of me\nAnd I'm livin in Long Island with a J-O-B\nOkay okay I got you wrong, I must admit\nI'ma give you a little time to see if you're legit\nSo we started goin out on a regular basis\nI was takin her to the movies and my hangout, places\nLike the Q Club, The Scene, or The Arcade\nI thought this relationship was tailor-made\nCause she was sweet kind considerate I, was hypnotized\nNever thought she'd try to pull the wool, over my eyes\nAfter I smacked it and flipped it, she thought I was whipped\nI know she is like a knockout but I'm not gettin bullwhipped\nShe asked me why I am so stingy I know you got the ends\nBecause you got two MV's, two BM's, an SL Benz\nWhat are you my accountant or the IRS?\nWhy ya clockin everything that I posess?\nShe want me to waste everything and be small as an elf\nLet me tell you somethin baby, let me tell you\n\n[Chorus Two - Biz singing]\nI can do bad by myself\nI don't need no help, to starve to death\nI can do that on my own\nI can do bad by myself\nI don't need no help, to starve to death\nI ain't tryin to be funny honey\n\n[Verse Three]\nNow all her friends boosted her, to get my dinero\nLike if I was a drunk Mexican, wearin a sombrero\nI knew she had a boyfriend on the side\nShe told me, yo, she didn't have to hide\nShe said she cut him because he was too jealous\nHe always thought I was tryin to talk to other fellas\nIt's now the present, and that was the past\nFrom now on bein with me, is gonna be a blast\nI know she thought in her mind, it's gonna be great\nJuicin and reducin everything I make\nWith her Victoria's Secrets neglice\nShe tried to seduce me in every way\nShe would come out to Jersey rain sleet or snow\nShe acted too true blue to be after my dough\nMy man, Jeff told me but I didn't wanna listen\nI was too hooked, and strung out, I thought he was dissin\nThen she popped the question, and asked me for some dough\nI looked her in her face and said, \"HELL NO!!!\"\nYou're a head nurse and you want my wealth?\nYou must be CRAZY AS HELL, cause\n\n[Chorus One]\n\n[Biz singing]\nLet me tell you know\nAll day long, you been talkin on the telephone\nBraggin to all your friends, about all the cars that I own\nBut YOUUUUUU don't tell 'em, that I'm the one doin it all\nWhile you're out there livin it up, and havin yo'self a ball\n\n[Chorus Two]\n\n[Biz singing]\nUmmm, whoah-whoah, yeah-yeahhhh!\nI can sing-ing-ing-ing.."}}, {"title": "I'm the Biz Markie", "album": "All Samples Cleared", "year": "1993-06-02", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIt's me the diabolical, Biz Mark symbolical\nI shakes from scripts of hits I made a while ago\nNow I'm on the run again starting other capers\nAnd people couldn't catch me even if I was \"The Vapors\"\nI leave you in trauma with my funky personna\nCause I'm jamming just like Teddy but I'm nasty like Madonna\nCause me without big strong thoughts for a Biz song\nIs like Patty LaBelle not singing with a wig on\nI don't give a damn if my record gets panned\nCause my style stays fresh like I rap in Saran\nWhen I'm sure that I'm pure like Snapple\nSuppose when I write my rhymes like I'm the Big Apple\nOr New York or whatever you call it, I don't even care\nCause if I can make it there, I can make it anywhere\nSo, I walk the walk through the streets of New York\nMore green I can hawk cause I can talk the talk\nSo don't try to stalk cause my style brings more\nI rock it from the Billy Ocean to the Al B. Shore!\nPeople always want to give dap to everyone\nBut I've been around the world so I ahhh ???\n\n[Hook]\n\"I'm the Biz Markie, the human beatbox and the rap king\"\n\"Have the people stomping to my beat you bet\"  (Repeat 4x)\n\n[Verse 2]\nTake a pause for the cause, cause this is a recording\nIf rap was a prison, then I be the warden\nI do the Gator in my snakeskin Jordans\nAnd when it comes to cash I flash more than Gordon\nYou want me to rock the rhyme cause I got the type you crave\nAnd I heat up jams like I was MC Microwave\nAnd when I drop a style, call it def, call it cool\nAs long as you don't call me when I'm on a toliet stool\nI stoke and swin in a room full of women\nWhen I drop the gold like Meadowlark Lemon\nEverywhere I've been I've seen 'em fat and thin\nEven girls with hair on their chinny chin chin\nBut you can be just a friend if you're sporting your own look\nOr if you got more chins than a Chinese phonebook\nWomen love my style from ??? Long Isle\nEven got my mother singing \"Thanks for my Child\"\nMy temperature rises every time I'm near a stereo\nCause I catch dance fever like my name was Danny Terio\nBut I go, on and on and on and on and on and!\nFrom midnight point to the early morning, AHHHH!\n\n[Hook]\n\"I'm the Biz Markie, the human beatbox and the rap king\"\n\"Have the people stomping to my beat you bet\"  (Repeat 4x)\n\n[Verse 3]\nIt's my way or the highway, I'm ahead of the slow lane\nBut when I ride to Motown I jump on a Soul Train\nRappers like to flow with all energy and action\nBut I'd rather take it nice and slow like Freddy Jackson\nSo don't try to stick to me like somebody's gearshift\nCause I'll hit you so far west you'll come back Easter\nThe style I display, but I say it a badder way\nI got more rhymes than cartoons on a Saturday\nYou're still confused cause you don't know how bad he is\nLike a pregnant ______ who don't know who the daddy is\nJust like a snap I can whip any rapper\nThat's why probably my grandparents called me a whipper snapper\nYou're lost in the sofa trying to cross my line\nThen run to the lost and found cause you lost your mind\nI'm coming on strong cause I'm dropping nothing soft\nStill had it going on when \"The Biz is Going Off\"\nI'm singing in the rain cause I got the audacity\nOr some kids want to sundance with Butch Cassidy\nYou couldn't shine on my in the spotlight\nCause your ass couldn't shine if you sat on a flashlight\n\n[Hook]\n\"I'm the Biz Markie, the human beatbox and the rap king\"\n\"Have the people stomping to my beat you bet\"  (Repeat 4x)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9703d795ec6c8c350b9674639f3fa5b8.500x500x1.jpg", "artist": "Biz Markie", "raw": {"annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/10379", "apple_music_id": null,

if I was \"The Vapors\"\nI leave you in trauma with my funky personna\nCause I'm jamming just like Teddy but I'm nasty like Madonna\nCause me without big strong thoughts for a Biz song\nIs like Patty LaBelle not singing with a wig on\nI don't give a damn if my record gets panned\nCause my style stays fresh like I rap in Saran\nWhen I'm sure that I'm pure like Snapple\nSuppose when I write my rhymes like I'm the Big Apple\nOr New York or whatever you call it, I don't even care\nCause if I can make it there, I can make it anywhere\nSo, I walk the walk through the streets of New York\nMore green I can hawk cause I can talk the talk\nSo don't try to stalk cause my style brings more\nI rock it from the Billy Ocean to the Al B. Shore!\nPeople always want to give dap to everyone\nBut I've been around the world so I ahhh ???\n\n[Hook]\n\"I'm the Biz Markie, the human beatbox and the rap king\"\n\"Have the people stomping to my beat you bet\"  (Repeat 4x)\n\n[Verse 2]\nTake a pause for the cause, cause this is a recording\nIf rap was a prison, then I be the warden\nI do the Gator in my snakeskin Jordans\nAnd when it comes to cash I flash more than Gordon\nYou want me to rock the rhyme cause I got the type you crave\nAnd I heat up jams like I was MC Microwave\nAnd when I drop a style, call it def, call it cool\nAs long as you don't call me when I'm on a toliet stool\nI stoke and swin in a room full of women\nWhen I drop the gold like Meadowlark Lemon\nEverywhere I've been I've seen 'em fat and thin\nEven girls with hair on their chinny chin chin\nBut you can be just a friend if you're sporting your own look\nOr if you got more chins than a Chinese phonebook\nWomen love my style from ??? Long Isle\nEven got my mother singing \"Thanks for my Child\"\nMy temperature rises every time I'm near a stereo\nCause I catch dance fever like my name was Danny Terio\nBut I go, on and on and on and on and on and!\nFrom midnight point to the early morning, AHHHH!\n\n[Hook]\n\"I'm the Biz Markie, the human beatbox and the rap king\"\n\"Have the people stomping to my beat you bet\"  (Repeat 4x)\n\n[Verse 3]\nIt's my way or the highway, I'm ahead of the slow lane\nBut when I ride to Motown I jump on a Soul Train\nRappers like to flow with all energy and action\nBut I'd rather take it nice and slow like Freddy Jackson\nSo don't try to stick to me like somebody's gearshift\nCause I'll hit you so far west you'll come back Easter\nThe style I display, but I say it a badder way\nI got more rhymes than cartoons on a Saturday\nYou're still confused cause you don't know how bad he is\nLike a pregnant ______ who don't know who the daddy is\nJust like a snap I can whip any rapper\nThat's why probably my grandparents called me a whipper snapper\nYou're lost in the sofa trying to cross my line\nThen run to the lost and found cause you lost your mind\nI'm coming on strong cause I'm dropping nothing soft\nStill had it going on when \"The Biz is Going Off\"\nI'm singing in the rain cause I got the audacity\nOr some kids want to sundance with Butch Cassidy\nYou couldn't shine on my in the spotlight\nCause your ass couldn't shine if you sat on a flashlight\n\n[Hook]\n\"I'm the Biz Markie, the human beatbox and the rap king\"\n\"Have the people stomping to my beat you bet\"  (Repeat 4x)"}}, {"title": "Me Versus Me", "album": "The Biz Never Sleeps", "year": "1989-10-10", "lyrics": "{*scats*} Biz {*scats*} Mark\n{*beatboxes*}\n\n[Verse One]\nI'm the original B-I-Z\nThe Emeza-Emeza-Emeza-Emeza-A-Rrah-K-I-E\nEverywhere I go, I always G\nI'm thinkin somethin that you never could see\nDoin the beatbox and the R-A-P\nThat's why I'm the Inhuman Orchestra, Biz Markie\nI'm here just doin my J-O-B\nSo I can reach the T-O-P\nAs soon as I get to the T-O-P\nThen I will be D-O-N with the E\nI rock New Jersey and N.Y.C\nWhether it's at a club or a block party\nTo my man Capri, Starchild and Brucie Bee\n{?}, Baby J, and DJ Marty\nThe title of the song in the place to be\nIs not this or that, it's \"Me Versus Me\"\n\n[Chorus: repeat 4X]\n{*Biz Markie beatboxes*}\nMe versus me\n\n[Verse Two]\nI think it's time to act up and throw a fit\nCause I'm rockin to a beat that just won't quit\nThis is the real thing, not counterfeit\nCause everything you hear, I'm doin it\nThe name of a baseball glove is a mitt\nAnd what I need on my BMW is a kit\nA preacher preaches from a pulpit\nAnd my man Benny Hill, got a lot of wit\nThe rhymes that I say are the ultimate\nAnd the way out anywhere is called an exit\nA real short play is called a skit\nAnd New Balance sneakers are legit\nThe past tense for bite, is called a bit\nEverywhere that I go, all attention I get\nI used to live by the North conduit\nThe Biz Markie will always make a hit!\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse Three]\nThis is one thing, that I like to say\nThis is a different kind of rhythm and rap display\nI'm not Frankie Crocker or Lamarr Renee\nCause both of them are radio DJ's\nOtis Redding be sittin by the dock of the bay\nI'm bound to wreck your body to the break of day\nAnd if you wanna see me at a show, you gotta pay\nCause if you don't you will have, a little delay\nZip-de-doo-dah, zip-de-day\nI'm the S-K the B-I-Z the Emezah-A-R-K\nAnd even if I'm buggin on out, around the way\nYou'll never see me drinkin Tanqueray\nSwan, G.

dream - yeah\nCause at the end of the day I'll be countin my mo-ney\n\n[Verse One: Biz Markie]\nIt's the M-zah, A-ah, R-zah, K-ah\nLike the internet, I am here to stay-ah\nBeen a long time, I know it's been years\nOops! I did it again, like Britney Spears\nLike The Matrix and Keanu Reeves\nRinged around the collar and doo doo on the sleeves\nI'm explosive like dynamite\nI should be on \"Entertainment Tonight\"\nOr \"Access Hollywood\" or \"Soul Train\"\nI'm so on fire, I fart propane\nDon't use Rogaine, got a head full of hair\nCause the brother on the mic is so debonnaire\nI'm so cool, the Fonz say \"EYY!\"\nCause I'm the best MC from around my way\nNever listen to what haters say\nI just stay focused like Kobe in L.A\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse Two: Biz Markie]\nI'mma do it like I never have done it\nNever got drunk and never got blunted\nThe Redox in my ear, they cost about a hundred\nIf the record's a hit, you know the Biz spun it\nSuper educated master rap techniquer\nIll funk freaker every day of the week-ah\nWhether it's Kim, Agnes, Monique or Tamika\nMy unique physique make 'em all weaker and weaker\nCause I'm hung, like Mighty Joe Young\nThey all get sprung, from the joy that I brung\nI drive a Hummer, I'm hot like Donna Summers\nI'm one of the first human (rum-a-pum pummers)\nNo matter what they say, I always sound flyer\nThan anyone you heard, or even de-sired\nYes it's me, I'm the Original B-I-Z\nM-A-R-K-I with the E\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse Three: Biz Markie]\nThe beat don't stop 'til everybody's gone\nI'm old school like a bag of Bon Ton\nLike the Mary Jane Girls I go \"All Night Long\"\nHit you in the head like El Kabong\nMy style is masculine, far from feminine\nI got soul like James Brown and Rakim and 'em\nI don't know what you came to do\nI came to rock the house for you\nFrom sunny California to Kalamazoo!\nBeen rockin parties since ninety-two\nI know you heard that Reality Bites\nBut I'm liver than the show called \"Saturday Night\"\nI stay on, it looks like city lights\nChicks cling on me like ballerina tights\nLike Minute Mouse and Courageous Cat\nYou can't beat that with a baseball bat!\n\n[Chorus]"}}, {"title": "Throw Back", "album": "Weekend Warrior", "year": "2003-11-18", "lyrics": "[Verse One]\nI'd like to tell a story and it goes like this\nBefore I was makin money hand over fist\nThe mid-80's is what I'm talkin about\nYou will agree without a reasonable doubt\nAs I tell this tale, sittin on a pail\nThis is one you'll like when it's done\nOnly certain people know about Union Square\nThe Rooftop, Latin Quarter, cause I was there\nRed Alert downtown, Brucie Bee uptown\nGrandmaster Vic had a different sound\nYou had block parties, with free gifts\nMr. Magic and Marley gave radio a lift\nYou don't understand, but we do\nThat's why I'm tryin to explain it to you\nSo sit back and listen, to what I say\nAs I tell the story of this beautiful day\n\n[Chorus: sampled]\n\"We'll go dancing in the dark\" - HEY!\n\"Walking through the park, and reminiscing\"\nBREAK IT ON DOWN!\n\n[Verse Two]\nBefore Versace and DKNY\nThere was a lot of clothes that was fly\nLike Polo, Benetton, Coca-Cola and Osh Kosh\nGuess jeans and others that's acid washed\nD.C. wore K-Swiss and Sergio Tacchini\nGirls wore tennis skirts, that was mini\nSpot{?}, Ewings, {?}\nNew Balance, Fila, Nike and Ellesse\nAfrican clothes and medallions was worn\nAnd when Rakim came out, knowledge was born\nIn the midst of it all, I almost forgot\nThere was a brother uptown makin his own spot\nMakin Gucci, leather and suede tailor made\nThat had more flavor than mom's Kool-Aid\nI'm gonna tell you, the name of this man\nHe goes by the name of the Dapper Dan\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse Three]\nSee at this time, you might think I'm strange\nCause I wore a four-finger ring, and big gold chains\nLike I was Mr. T from the A-Team\nIt was just a sign of me makin cream\nBut the cars and jeeps was incred-a\nLike the Audi, 280 Z's, 98's and Jettas\nCherokees, Wranglers, Suzuki Sidekicks\nL.A. and West coast cars was doin tricks\nNow the dances was crazy to match\nLike the Pee Wee, The Wop and the Cabbage Patch\nThe Prep, The Snake, and \"The Biz Mark, Biz Mark\"\nThe way the Gucci Girls gave shows a spark\nNow listen, to what I got to say-ah\nReagan was Pres', and Koch was the Mayor\nYou can't beat that with a baseball bat\nAnd you'd never see me without my Biz Mark hat\n\n[Chorus] - 4X w/ ad libs", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0e825d5daf35800f4be503b4ff58164c.640x640x1.jpg", "artist": "Biz Markie", "raw": {"annotation_count": 16,

tell this tale, sittin on a pail\nThis is one you'll like when it's done\nOnly certain people know about Union Square\nThe Rooftop, Latin Quarter, cause I was there\nRed Alert downtown, Brucie Bee uptown\nGrandmaster Vic had a different sound\nYou had block parties, with free gifts\nMr. Magic and Marley gave radio a lift\nYou don't understand, but we do\nThat's why I'm tryin to explain it to you\nSo sit back and listen, to what I say\nAs I tell the story of this beautiful day\n\n[Chorus: sampled]\n\"We'll go dancing in the dark\" - HEY!\n\"Walking through the park, and reminiscing\"\nBREAK IT ON DOWN!\n\n[Verse Two]\nBefore Versace and DKNY\nThere was a lot of clothes that was fly\nLike Polo, Benetton, Coca-Cola and Osh Kosh\nGuess jeans and others that's acid washed\nD.C. wore K-Swiss and Sergio Tacchini\nGirls wore tennis skirts, that was mini\nSpot{?}, Ewings, {?}\nNew Balance, Fila, Nike and Ellesse\nAfrican clothes and medallions was worn\nAnd when Rakim came out, knowledge was born\nIn the midst of it all, I almost forgot\nThere was a brother uptown makin his own spot\nMakin Gucci, leather and suede tailor made\nThat had more flavor than mom's Kool-Aid\nI'm gonna tell you, the name of this man\nHe goes by the name of the Dapper Dan\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse Three]\nSee at this time, you might think I'm strange\nCause I wore a four-finger ring, and big gold chains\nLike I was Mr. T from the A-Team\nIt was just a sign of me makin cream\nBut the cars and jeeps was incred-a\nLike the Audi, 280 Z's, 98's and Jettas\nCherokees, Wranglers, Suzuki Sidekicks\nL.A. and West coast cars was doin tricks\nNow the dances was crazy to match\nLike the Pee Wee, The Wop and the Cabbage Patch\nThe Prep, The Snake, and \"The Biz Mark, Biz Mark\"\nThe way the Gucci Girls gave shows a spark\nNow listen, to what I got to say-ah\nReagan was Pres', and Koch was the Mayor\nYou can't beat that with a baseball bat\nAnd you'd never see me without my Biz Mark hat\n\n[Chorus] - 4X w/ ad libs"}}, {"title": "Not a Freak", "album": "Weekend Warrior", "year": "2003-11-18", "lyrics": "[Biz Markie]\nIn what?

her\nMy jingle bella, always Roc-A-Fella\nEven my acapella will be a best seller\nShe couldn't believe what I had achieved\nFunky like ring around the collar, doo doo on the sleeves\nEnquiring minds always want to know\nHow did I get my ill freestyle flow?\nI just tell 'em straight up without no B\nAsk me no questions yo, here's my ID\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse Three - same echo once again]\nI'm not Captain Kirk, or Mr. Spock\nWhen I put the party people in a state of shock\nI'm like Mark Twain, or Shakespeare\nCause when I'm on the stage, people throw they hands in the air\nWavin 'em wild, like in a frenzy\nDog in the house like I'm Spuds McKenzie\nI'm just doin it, just rockin the house\nSucker MC's is spiders or mouse\nComin off the top of my head\nI'm not dumb so don't be misled\nWhen I was young, I never pissed in the bed\nAlways listened to what my moms and pops said\nLove reggae so much, you could call me a dred\nGot a big belly so you know I'm well fed\nAnd I'm a lover-lover like

echoed]\nDon't go to Getty, go to Exxon\nLike \"Bonita Applebum,\" ya gotta put me on\nGot good luck like Lucky Charms leprechaun\nCan't believe Freaky Tah and Big L is gone\nYou think I'm a mailman, well my delivery\nAin't no other brother like the B-I with the Z\nEmezah-A-Rrrah, say K-I with the E\nI got mo' rhymes than Muhammad Ali\nNot number one but here to have fun\nGuaranteed to proceed and get the job done\nY'all, know, my competition is none\nFunky funky fresh from the day I begun\nYou rock with me, you're guaranteed to have a ball\nGot a big belly, over six feet tall\nMy favorite team is the Vikings when I watch football\nHere's another one to get you off the wall\n\n[Chorus - unknown female while Jeff scratches]\nHe's Biz Markie, as you can see\nHe came to tear tear tear shit up {\"C'mon!\"}\nHe's Biz Markie, as you can see\nHe came to tear tear tear shit up {\"C'mon!\"}\nHe's Biz Markie, as you can see\nHe came to tear tear tear shit up {\"C'mon!\"}\nHe's Biz Markie, as you can see\nHe came to tear tear tear shit up, up, up {\"C'mon!\"}\n\n[Verse Two - with the same echo]\nSoon to be elected in the Hall of Fame\nI rock the microphone, emceeing's my game\nI flip so many styles, my name should be Flipper\nOn Three's Company, I wish I was Jack Tripper\nBack in the days, I used to eat {?}litina{?}\nBack in the days, my sister had a Thumbelina\nBack in the days, I liked a girl named Angelina\nBack in the days, I wanted to get in between her\nMy jingle bella, always Roc-A-Fella\nEven my acapella will be a best seller\nShe couldn't believe what I had achieved\nFunky like ring around the collar, doo doo on the sleeves\nEnquiring minds always want to know\nHow did I get my ill freestyle flow?\nI just tell 'em straight up without no B\nAsk me no questions yo, here's my ID\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse Three - same echo once again]\nI'm not Captain Kirk, or Mr. Spock\nWhen I put the party people in a state of shock\nI'm like Mark Twain, or Shakespeare\nCause when I'm on the stage, people throw they hands in the air\nWavin 'em wild, like in a frenzy\nDog in the house like I'm Spuds McKenzie\nI'm just doin it, just rockin the house\nSucker MC's is spiders or mouse\nComin off the top of my head\nI'm not dumb so don't be misled\nWhen I was young, I never pissed in the bed\nAlways listened to what my moms and pops said\nLove reggae so much, you could call me

your head\nAnd then, this the way you do it\nOne.. two..\nOne, two, three, here!\n\n\"Go Biz Mark!

I'm just sayin like this\nI don't whassup, but\nI think you will understand a little bit more of the situation\nI'mma say like he would say it, on this second part\nSo just check this out aight?\nJust kick it one two three, go head, go head man, go head\n\nHe was a crook -- at the age of nine\nDo whatever it took -- he'll ROB YOU BLIND\nSnatchin pocketbooks, robbin blind ol men\nWay back WHEN.. when he was only ten\nThen when he was in 5th grade, he carried a switchblade\nTried to stay rich to keep him and his bitch paid\nAnd if he ever had to travel somewhere far\nTake a bus? PSSH - HE'D GO STEAL HIM A CAR!\nHe'd always choose to live his life the wild way\nTag?! Russian Roulette is what he'll play\nHis moms and pops told him when he first reached Junior High\nThe way you live determine just how soon you die\nAnd he didn't care because to him it was fun\nAnd he was only THIRTEEN when he got his first gun\nHe robbed stores and did stick-ups frequently\nGave a new name to juvenile delinquency\nAnd yeah you know that, he, was on the go\nSeven days of the week, he kept his pockets full of dough\nBut he was headed for a dead end fast\nCold riskin his ass for petty cash that didn't last\nWent back and forth to jail six times\nFor stolen cars and stick-up and various crimes\nSo when he sit in his cell, he reminisce as a child\nIt don't pay to do crime today, so don't be buck wild..\n\nAy that that that's a little bit of a lesson\nFor all the kids out there you know now\nYeah yeah yeah you know what I'm sayin\nAnd this is comin from\nThe Grand High Exalted Mystic Ruler\nAin't no one cooler\nIn 7th grade I had a teacher named Mr. Dulah\nWho used to wear his pants up to his chest\nAnd I want you to just listen\nCause.. this is no joke, so don't be buck wild..", "image": "https://images.genius.com/40f66b653cd7b106d8dea9f33eac5a75.598x598x1.jpg",

"lyrics": "Hey I'd like to tell you a little story\nAbout my man named Dee\nYo, even from when he was little\nHe was like kinda on a tough tip\nDoin all that stuff\nBut, I'mma tell you the way..\n.. it should really go like..\n.. the way he would say it now check this out\n\nWhen I was young, he always dreamed of bein rich\nBut compared to then, that'd been a big switch\nDrivin big cars, wearin rings and ropes\nBut man without a plan all he had was hopes\nSo he sat down, and thought, what he wanted to be\nBut it seems, no occupation had appeal to Dee\nHe didn't wanna be a doctor, he don't like school\nIt wasn't that he was dumb, he just thought he was too cool\nCause all the moneymakers and the big-time crooks\nHe never ever seen NONE of them carryin books\nHe used to be on the block, do whatever they pleased\nNever had a nine to five, but STILl clocked G's\nHarold Reuben, Freewood Ave would make a man of them too\nAnd he thought, yeah that's the life, he wanna do like they do\nSo he start to flip and cut class with the big boys\nTake other kids toys, cause he didn't dig noid\nHe'd rather run the block and watch the hustlers play\nAnd he'll say, he wanna be just like that one day\nHe used to run in the stores, steal cookies and candy bars\nWatchin the pimps roll by in they fancy cars\nBut never did the thought even pass\nAt the time, he 'posed to have his behind in class\nSo when report cards came, all he received was a F jack\nAnd he got his neck smacked, for cold gettin left back\nBut yet and still, he didn't care\nCause to him, school's for the birds so he didn't belong there\nWhen he was only eight he hung out with the pros\nAnd he went, from stealin candy, to boostin clothes\nHe used to dip out the class, go straight to the mall\nAnd he'll take, ANYTHING from anybody at all\nHis neighbors used to ask his mother \"Brown what's WRONG witcha child?\nHe done ROBBED my damn house again, yo that kid is buck wild..\"\n\nYo, I don't know whassup, but he be BUGGIN word up\nYo that yo.. I'm just sayin like this\nI don't whassup, but\nI think you will understand a little bit more of the situation\nI'mma say like he would say it, on this second part\nSo just check this out aight?\nJust kick it one two three, go head, go head man, go head\n\nHe was a crook -- at the age of nine\nDo whatever it took -- he'll ROB YOU BLIND\nSnatchin pocketbooks, robbin blind ol men\nWay back WHEN.. when he was only ten\nThen when he was in 5th grade, he carried a switchblade\nTried to stay rich to keep him and his bitch paid\nAnd if he ever had to travel somewhere far\nTake a bus? PSSH - HE'D GO STEAL HIM A CAR!\nHe'd always choose to live his life the wild way\nTag?! Russian Roulette is what he'll play\nHis moms and pops told him when he first reached Junior High\nThe way you live determine just how soon you die\nAnd he didn't care because to him it was fun\nAnd he was only THIRTEEN when he got his first gun\nHe robbed stores and did stick-ups frequently\nGave a new name to juvenile delinquency\nAnd yeah you know that, he, was on the go\nSeven days of the week, he kept his pockets full of dough\nBut he was headed for a dead end fast\nCold riskin his ass for petty cash that didn't last\nWent back and forth to jail six times\nFor stolen cars and stick-up and various crimes\nSo when he sit in his cell, he reminisce as a child\nIt don't pay to do crime today, so don't be buck wild..\n\nAy that that that's a little bit of a lesson\nFor all the kids out there you know now\nYeah yeah yeah you know what I'm sayin\nAnd this is comin from\nThe Grand High Exalted Mystic Ruler\nAin't no one cooler\nIn 7th grade I had a teacher named Mr. Dulah\nWho used to wear his pants up to his chest\nAnd I want you to just listen\nCause.. this is no joke, so don't be buck wild.."}}, {"title": "I'm Singin'", "album": "All Samples Cleared", "year": "1993-06-02", "lyrics": "[Cool V]\nYo Biz, let's send this out to the propmaster Kool DJ Red Alert\nBring the beat in, Todd\nYeah, this is how we're doing it for the '93, we're on the smooth tip\nHa ha, yo Biz, kick something funky for 'em, word up\n\n[BizMarkie]\nNow people always want to know my strategy plan\nFor me to use the weird name as \"Diabolical Man\"\nWell I got diabolical beats, raggedy clothes\nAnd aw hell, I'm even wearing diabolical drawers\nI'm not White as Barry cauce I'm Dirtier than Harry\nWith a rap that's big and fat that Mariah couldn't Carey\nSo don't come to me with that same ol' same ol'\nCause I'll knock your butt somewhere over the rainbow\nI write rhymes that jam more than jelly\nSo call me the Arthur without the Fonzarelli, or Nelly\nCause I am so bad when it comes to a rap jam\nEven robins scream, \"Holy hip-hop Biz man!\"\nI grab the microphone and go every which way but loose\nCause I'm the ugly ducking that seduces Mother Goose\nAnd I don't be using flipping tounge twisters\nBut I still get better in time like The Whispers\nBut older crews you see can't stay as loose as me\nCause old school rappers just ain't what they used to be\nSo up your nose with a rubber hose\nAnd every brother knows that your style's older than my grandma's clothes\nBut gray skies is going to clear up, so put on a happy face\nTake off that frown and chear up, and put on a happy face, cause\n\n\tI'm sing-ing-ing-ing in the rain ain ain (Repeat 7x)\n\tAh ah ah ah ah\n\nI start with a rhyme as I enter your mind\nI hit so hard even Michael Jackson won't remember the time\nSo here I come a bombing every time I home in to\nOff a funky drummer boom I get hot as Donna Summers\nCause I reigh supreme as a rap brainstorm\n]From corner to corner, I'm dropping some more on ya\nNot Tony Toni Tone, cause I came to warn you\nThat I even reign in Southern California\nEverybody talking bout Biz is hype\nCause I make Dirty Harry's day, hell I even make Gladys Knight's\nSoon I star on ABC because rapping DEF is the best way to the G\nAlphabetically I have to lead you through\nSince I'm the M-izza I know to watch my P's and Q's\nLike the EMT's but the B-I-Z\nI rap so picture perfect I should just stop and say \"Cheese\"\nSo if I step up, who's gonna move me back?\nCause Scooby Doo can't even do that for a Scooby Snack\nYou think you can, you think you can, don't even try it\nCause instead you need to can it like the Jolly Green Giant\nCause trying to step to Biz, you know I'm a diss them fast\nSo play like 98.7 and KISS my ass!\nCause me and rap is like peanut butter and jelly\nWhich reminds me of a song by my man Gene Kelly\n\n\tI'm sing-ing-ing-ing in the rain ain ain (Repeat 7x)\n\tAh ah ah ah ah\n\nNow it's the universal languange that the Biz Mark is speaking\nI'm down with blacks, whites, Indian, and Puerto Rican\nI'm an African descendent, myself would have say\nBut I was \"Booooorn in the U.S.A.!\"\nI spent the 80's duking ladies without making babies\nSo I guess I'm over like a fat rat that never caught rabies\nWent from messing around like Tonto with no woman in 3 years\nI had one little two little three little indian\nB-I-Z Markie is what it is\nAnd if it's hard for you to spell, then just say \"Biz\"\nI'm down with the Zoo Crew, some kids who act nutty\nB-Danks, Cool V, Everett, Todd, and Jeff\nThey're my buddies, ha, my buddies, ha\nWherever I go, we go\nI pass my April Fools in monster May\nI pass by so much bull I should say \"Ole!\"\nI got friends named Raggedy Ann and Andy\nCall my \"Bon appetite\" cause I'm sweeter than John Candy\nDon't even knock it, till you try me\nCause the proof is in the pudding, you can ask Bill Cosby\nSome think I'm bragging, some think I'm boasting\nBut even Smokey Robinson would second that emotion\nThat's why I take through the sky on a natural high\nCause I'm fly-ly-ly-ly-ly, ly ly ly ly\n\n\tI'm sing-ing-ing-ing in the rain ain ain (Repeat 7x)\n\tAh ah ah ah ah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9703d795ec6c8c350b9674639f3fa5b8.500x500x1.jpg", "artist": "Biz Markie", "raw": {"annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/10380",

beat in, Todd\nYeah, this is how we're doing it for the '93, we're on the smooth tip\nHa ha, yo Biz, kick something funky for 'em, word up\n\n[BizMarkie]\nNow people always want to know my strategy plan\nFor me to use the weird name as \"Diabolical Man\"\nWell I got diabolical beats, raggedy clothes\nAnd aw hell, I'm even wearing diabolical drawers\nI'm not White as Barry cauce I'm Dirtier than Harry\nWith a rap that's big and fat that Mariah couldn't Carey\nSo don't come to me with that same ol' same ol'\nCause I'll knock your butt somewhere over the rainbow\nI write rhymes that jam more than jelly\nSo call me the Arthur without the Fonzarelli, or Nelly\nCause I am so bad when it comes to a rap jam\nEven robins scream, \"Holy hip-hop Biz man!\"\nI grab the microphone and go every which way but loose\nCause I'm the ugly ducking that seduces Mother Goose\nAnd I don't be using flipping tounge twisters\nBut I still get better in time like The Whispers\nBut older crews you see can't stay as loose as me\nCause old school rappers just ain't what they used to be\nSo up your nose with a rubber hose\nAnd every brother knows that your style's older than my grandma's clothes\nBut gray skies is going to clear up, so put on a happy face\nTake off that frown and chear up, and put on a happy face, cause\n\n\tI'm sing-ing-ing-ing in the rain ain ain (Repeat 7x)\n\tAh ah ah ah ah\n\nI start with a rhyme as I enter your mind\nI hit so hard even Michael Jackson won't remember the time\nSo here I come a bombing every time I home in to\nOff a funky drummer boom I get hot as Donna Summers\nCause I reigh supreme as a rap brainstorm\n]From corner to corner, I'm dropping some more on ya\nNot Tony Toni Tone, cause I came to warn you\nThat I even reign in Southern California\nEverybody talking bout Biz is hype\nCause I make Dirty Harry's day, hell I even make Gladys Knight's\nSoon I star on ABC because rapping DEF is the best way to the G\nAlphabetically I have to lead you through\nSince I'm the M-izza I know to watch my P's and Q's\nLike the EMT's but the B-I-Z\nI rap so picture perfect I should just stop and say \"Cheese\"\nSo if I step up, who's gonna move me back?\nCause Scooby Doo can't even do that for a Scooby Snack\nYou think you can, you think you can, don't even try it\nCause instead you need to can it like the Jolly Green Giant\nCause trying to step to Biz, you know I'm a diss them fast\nSo play like 98.7 and KISS my ass!\nCause me and rap is like peanut butter and jelly\nWhich reminds me of a song by my man Gene Kelly\n\n\tI'm sing-ing-ing-ing in the rain ain ain (Repeat 7x)\n\tAh ah ah ah ah\n\nNow it's the universal languange that the Biz Mark is speaking\nI'm down with blacks, whites, Indian, and Puerto Rican\nI'm an African descendent, myself would have say\nBut I was \"Booooorn in the U.S.A.!\"\nI spent the 80's duking ladies without making babies\nSo I guess I'm over like a fat rat that never caught rabies\nWent from messing around like Tonto with no woman in 3 years\nI had one little two little three little indian\nB-I-Z Markie is what it is\nAnd if it's hard for you to spell, then just say \"Biz\"\nI'm down with the Zoo Crew, some kids who act nutty\nB-Danks, Cool V, Everett, Todd, and Jeff\nThey're my buddies, ha, my buddies, ha\nWherever I go, we go\nI pass my April Fools in monster May\nI pass by so much bull I should say \"Ole!\"\nI got friends named Raggedy Ann and Andy\nCall my \"Bon appetite\" cause I'm sweeter than John Candy\nDon't even knock it, till you try me\nCause the proof is in the pudding, you can ask Bill Cosby\nSome think I'm bragging, some think I'm boasting\nBut even Smokey Robinson would second that emotion\nThat's why I take through the sky on a natural high\nCause I'm fly-ly-ly-ly-ly, ly ly ly ly\n\n\tI'm sing-ing-ing-ing in the rain ain ain (Repeat 7x)\n\tAh ah ah ah ah"}}, {"title": "Take it From the Top", "album": "I Need a Haircut", "year":

stop\nA twink-twinkle, a rock the house\nAnd my man Diamond Shell, a rock the house\nCan't forget my man Sal, rock the house, and\nFelle Fel, rock the house\nI can't forget, Capital, rock the house\nMy man Capital T, will rock the house\nAnd to my man B, a rock the house, and\nMy man Frankie, a rock the house\nI can't forget Doo G, rock the house\nAnd my man Cool V, a rocks the house y'all\nAh to the beat y'all, you don't stop\nI'm Biz Markie with the funky sound\nAnd right about now, here's the countdown\nOne.. two.. one, two, three\n\n[Hook]\nYo B take it from the top\nYo B take it from the top (sayyy whaaaat?)\nYo B take it from the top\nYo B take it from the top (wellllllll)\n\n[Verse One]\nWell I demand respect, so everybody salute\nAnd by the way Backspin, is my attribute\nYou may or may not, know who I am\nBut frankly my dear.. I don't give a damn!\nYou may know me from \"Rockin' With Biz Markie\"\nOr Shante, when she used to battle Sparky\nYou might have seen in some videos with other folks\nSittin on the bench while me and Biz was tellin mother jokes\nThe meaning of my name some people may, try to guess\nYes yes I'm fresh to the flesh, so let me manifest\nI make romance, I'm not a freelance\nI spin records; BITCH I don't breakdance!\nI scoop girls around the world that's what B does\nThe name Backspin means that B was\nBorn.. as a creative, cut king\nSupreme poet, inferior to nothing\nCall me the teacher, since I'm the one who taught you\n(What's that?) Myyyyyyy DICK! (CAUGHT YOU!)\nI'm signin off because my rhyme's complete\nI say peace to Chancellor Avenue and Bergen Street\n\n[Hook]\nYo Cap take it from the top\nYo Cap take it from the top (sayyy whaaaat?)\nYo Cap take it from the top\nYo Cap take it from the top (wellllllll)\n\n[Verse Two]\nWell get a grip and, yeah the Capital's rippin\nMore than just a ordinary style, cold flippin\nThose that attempt to diss, or try to take this\nTitle away what? I think you better forget it\nPit-pat this Jack, get off of the crack black\nIt's the true fact, your record hit the pillow sack\nAnd now you're wonderin how make a comeback\nBut don't make me laugh, your studio's a two-track\nBiz hits the bassline, then I rip the real line\nTogether it's combined and designed to a master rhyme\nA little touch from Cool V himself\nAn overnight process then it's ready for the shelves\nPerfect shit on wax is made\nThen bring it to the radio and let it get played\nThere's no joke and only time to get fanatical\nSo listen up or pay attention to the Capital\nI'm done with the rhyme for the time, so you can have 'em\nAiyyo guys, why don't you throw somethin funky at 'em\n\n[Hook]\nYo Shell take it from the top\nYo Shell take it from the top (sayyy whaaaat?)\nYo Shell take it from the top\nYo Shell take it from the top (wellllllll)\n\n[Verse Three]\nY'all know me, as the Original D\nLike to the I say with the A and hey\nBust this, M-O-N-D\nI grab the mic and recite rhymes in your left ear\nIt's always def and different\nNever somethin from the previous years\nI'm quite slim, but rougher than a pair of Timbs\nThe Diamond Shell will never trip stagger fall or bend\nI don't smoke and never ever have I drank no liquor\nBein smooth keeps my rhyme style, that much quicker\nSo yo hey chief, bust this technique of speak\nI'm feelin sheik and also rather unique\nI'm smooth as (?), you can't deny I'm\nInnovative with style, and bound to hit primetime soon\nAs I tour from Kalamazoo to the moon\nGive props to the rapper, the brother dresses Dapper\nThan Dan cause I'm the man I'd like to make ya toes tap\nWith the, funky type of flow, I'm smooth as a Lambo'-\n-Ghini I dream of Jeannie her hands on my jam\nSo, once but not twice, this brother's precise\nWhen it comes to snakin girls I get as crooked as loaded dice\nPullin women can't no man compete\nI nut 'em all from the Great Wall down to Wall Street\nSo..\n\n[Hook]\nYo Fell take it from the top\nYo Fell take it from the top (sayyy whaaaat?)\nYo Fell take it from the top\nYo Fell take it from the top (wellllllll)\n\n[Verse Four: Force Fell]\nReady for the riot I rip rap rapacious\nCrews don't slip you're payin penalty slashes\nClashes crashed, but I crash ass or\nRavish the mic, and then I'mma pass all\nHard to handle run a gamble like Vegas\nBut I never lost the force be runnin wages\nOf pages, and pages, biters think I'm cajun\nSpice cause I'm so nice and eighteen is my age is\nRappers crumble when I tackle they crackle I ramshackle\nDon't even know why they waste time on the pack'll\nOf nine cause my rhymes do 'em in like rifles\nStress the word, so you know I live trifle\nMC's, metamorphosize to digest\nDays from a faze and my praise is like a rajah\nI reckon, that crews that step over this way\nThink life is a game and they just too pissed to play\nSome say, on mics I'm a master\nA snatcher, a catcher, a very well matcher\nBut crews better know that I hit like after\nEffects who's next I wreck from now til then\nAnd then when the then comes, I'mma go hit again\nLike rat-a-tat-tat of the tickedy eatin dick-er whore\nSo every move I make I make sure, it's riggydiggyraw\nBiz\n\n[Verse Five]\nMar, kie the original\nEverytime I see V, yo I got material\nI was just kickin funky records for you\nCause I'm down with the rhythm of a, ah one chk two\nSingin, on records, I get respected\nIt don't matter to me cause you know that I'm connected\nWith B-M-V Biz Mark and Vaughn\nDown to wreck collect and then jet, to the break of dawn\nDiscombobulate, sentence ain't complete\nUnless I go {*beatbox*} AHH AHH AHH UHH {*cough*} on beat\nZip-zop-a-zigga-lah, zagga-zucka-zaii\nNo matter what I say, I always come out fly\nBecause my records get respected as I like jettin\nYou will agree it's me, cause you know I'm inventin\nA different kind of rhythm of rhymin state\nThat's why you like everything I create\n\"Pickin' Boogers\", \"The Vapors\", \"Just a Friend\"\nThat's just some of the things you can comprehend\nSo just check it, MC's wreck it\nYou listen to the Biz Markie, don't disrespect it\nJust listen!", "image":

I don't give a damn!\nYou may know me from \"Rockin' With Biz Markie\"\nOr Shante, when she used to battle Sparky\nYou might have seen in some videos with other folks\nSittin on the bench while me and Biz was tellin mother jokes\nThe meaning of my name some people may, try to guess\nYes yes I'm fresh to the flesh, so let me manifest\nI make romance, I'm not a freelance\nI spin records; BITCH I don't breakdance!\nI scoop girls around the world that's what B does\nThe name Backspin means that B was\nBorn.. as a creative, cut king\nSupreme poet, inferior to nothing\nCall me the teacher, since I'm the one who taught you\n(What's that?) Myyyyyyy DICK! (CAUGHT YOU!)\nI'm signin off because my rhyme's complete\nI say peace to Chancellor Avenue and Bergen Street\n\n[Hook]\nYo Cap take it from the top\nYo Cap take it from the top (sayyy whaaaat?)\nYo Cap take it from the top\nYo Cap take it from the top (wellllllll)\n\n[Verse Two]\nWell get a grip and, yeah the Capital's rippin\nMore than just a ordinary style, cold flippin\nThose that attempt to diss, or try to take this\nTitle away what? I think you better forget it\nPit-pat this Jack, get off of the crack black\nIt's the true fact, your record hit the pillow sack\nAnd now you're wonderin how make a comeback\nBut don't make me laugh, your studio's a two-track\nBiz hits the bassline, then I rip the real line\nTogether it's combined and designed to a master rhyme\nA little touch from Cool V himself\nAn overnight process then it's ready for the shelves\nPerfect shit on wax is made\nThen bring it to the radio and let it get played\nThere's no joke and only time to get fanatical\nSo listen up or pay attention to the Capital\nI'm done with the rhyme for the time, so you can have 'em\nAiyyo guys, why don't you throw somethin funky at 'em\n\n[Hook]\nYo Shell take it from the top\nYo Shell take it from the top (sayyy whaaaat?)\nYo Shell take it from the top\nYo Shell take it from the top (wellllllll)\n\n[Verse Three]\nY'all know me, as the Original D\nLike to the I say with the A and hey\nBust this, M-O-N-D\nI grab the mic and recite rhymes in your left ear\nIt's always def and different\nNever somethin from the previous years\nI'm quite slim, but rougher than a pair of Timbs\nThe Diamond Shell will never trip stagger fall or bend\nI don't smoke and never ever have I drank no liquor\nBein smooth keeps my rhyme style, that much quicker\nSo yo hey chief, bust this technique of speak\nI'm feelin sheik and also rather unique\nI'm smooth as (?), you can't deny I'm\nInnovative with style, and bound to hit primetime soon\nAs I tour from Kalamazoo to the moon\nGive props to the rapper, the brother dresses Dapper\nThan Dan cause I'm the man I'd like to make ya toes tap\nWith the, funky type of flow, I'm smooth as a Lambo'-\n-Ghini I dream of Jeannie her hands on my jam\nSo, once but not twice, this brother's precise\nWhen it comes to snakin girls I get as crooked as loaded dice\nPullin women can't no man compete\nI nut 'em all from the Great Wall down to Wall Street\nSo..\n\n[Hook]\nYo Fell take it from the top\nYo Fell take it from the top (sayyy whaaaat?)\nYo Fell take it from the top\nYo Fell take it from the top (wellllllll)\n\n[Verse Four: Force Fell]\nReady for the riot I rip rap rapacious\nCrews don't slip you're payin penalty slashes\nClashes crashed, but I crash ass or\nRavish the mic, and then I'mma pass all\nHard to handle run a gamble like Vegas\nBut I never lost the force be runnin wages\nOf pages, and pages, biters think I'm cajun\nSpice cause I'm so nice and eighteen is my age is\nRappers crumble when I tackle they crackle I ramshackle\nDon't even know why they waste time on the pack'll\nOf nine cause my rhymes do 'em in like rifles\nStress the word, so you know I live trifle\nMC's, metamorphosize to digest\nDays from a faze and my praise is like a rajah\nI reckon, that crews that step over this way\nThink life is a game and they just too pissed to play\nSome say, on mics I'm a master\nA snatcher, a catcher, a very well matcher\nBut crews better know that I hit like after\nEffects who's next I wreck from now til then\nAnd then when the then comes, I'mma go hit again\nLike rat-a-tat-tat of the tickedy eatin dick-er whore\nSo every move I make I make sure, it's riggydiggyraw\nBiz\n\n[Verse Five]\nMar, kie the original\nEverytime I see V, yo I got material\nI was just kickin funky records for you\nCause I'm down with the rhythm of a, ah one chk two\nSingin, on records, I get respected\nIt don't matter to me cause you know that I'm connected\nWith B-M-V Biz Mark and Vaughn\nDown to wreck collect and then jet, to the break of dawn\nDiscombobulate, sentence ain't complete\nUnless I go {*beatbox*} AHH AHH AHH UHH {*cough*} on beat\nZip-zop-a-zigga-lah, zagga-zucka-zaii\nNo matter what I say, I always come out fly\nBecause my records get respected as I like jettin\nYou will agree it's me, cause you know I'm inventin\nA different kind of rhythm of rhymin state\nThat's why you like everything I create\n\"Pickin' Boogers\", \"The Vapors\", \"Just a Friend\"\nThat's just some of the things you can comprehend\nSo just check it, MC's wreck it\nYou listen to the Biz Markie, don't disrespect it\nJust listen!"}}, {"title": "On

house\nSquig Love is in the house\nCool V on the vocal, gettin me mad\nBut I'm gonna lil' do a lil' somethin like this\nCheck this out\n\nOne.. two.. one, two, three\nOn and on and on and on and on\nOn and on and on and on and on\nOn and on and on and on and on\nNon-stop rappin to the break of dawn\nI'm the Biz Mark, and I'm a sure shot\nAll of a sudden, you you you you..\nI got a friend by the name of Charlie\nCharlie got a wife by the name of Dolly\nDolly and Charlie got a son named Wally\nAnd Wally got a girl by the name of Polly\nPolly got a sister by the name of Molly\nMolly and Polly got a mother named Holly\nFather named Arthur, we call him Artie\nYou don't understand and I'm very very sorry\nCousin named Freida, Uncle named Skeeter\nHe's married to my fine Aunt Rita\nWho is the leader, of the merry cheaters\nSo, I don't greet ehr cause my Uncle don't need her\nGrandma Joyce, drives a Rolls Royce\nOf the family I'm a favorite choice\nBuddy named Homer, used to be a loner\nNow he got a girl by the name of Mona\nNow that Homer's marries to Mona\nAll he does all day is bone bone bone her\nPartner named Lex, get big respect\nDrivin in his black 300 Z-X\nWeek after next, when Lex his get check\nMe and Lex will be chillin in the X\nMy girl Eleanor, went to the drugstore\nTo get deoderant, I figure for sure\nCause the one she used before made her underarms sore\nAnd that's why Eleanor, don't use it no more\nHer girl named Betty, who used to go with Freddie\nAsked me was I ready, for us to go steady\nI told Betty, I wasn't ready\nTo go steady, cause it would hurt Freddie\nA girl named Glen, she's my best friend\nKnown her ever since who knows when\nAnd do you comprehend, the message that I send\nOf family and friends of Grandpa Ben\nLike this like that like that like this\nYou know the Biz Mark's on top of the list\nI rock the house and MC'sll know-a\n'Member when they had a place called Shanendoah?\nShanendoah, and St. Noah\nBiz Markie, the def rhyme flower\nYo I would not rely on Noah\n(??) all the (??) like an MC sewer\nZiga-rocka-zayga, MC say a\nA different kind of rhythm of rhymin display-a\n{*beatboxing*} AHH AHH AHHA AHH AHH, HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE\nThe original B-I-Z\nWith the C-double-O L-V you see\nAin't no other MC like me!\nCause I will rock say immediately\nThat's why I'm chillin in the L-I-N-D, E with the N\nWith the MC street\nYou will agree it's me, cause I rock a funky beat\nThe, oh-riginal B, I-Z-M-A-R\nK-I with the E, are a superstar\nThey are I am me, is it because I\nKnow how R-A-P, no, I think it's deep\nCause my DJ Cool V is a rockin\nAnd a guaranteed to rock and be always clockin\nSo listen to the hyper, MC fifer\nIs it because, yo, I'm not the type of guy\nThat know how to make a B-I-Z-M-A\nR-K-I-and you know that the rhymes fly\nNow I go on, zest and sing\nMan appointed rap king make the 'phone sing\nI'm Biz Mark, the microphone king-er\nDown to wreck your body, super-educated\nLike swinger of a rap, make your hands clap\nSoon to adapt; hey - say, oh Jack\nWith the rhyme of the MC time\nWill agree it's me, Aries is my sign\nSo is Cool V, nine-teen\nDown to wreck your body and on the scene\nWe went to the fight with Foreman/Holyfield\nAll of a sudden, we saw a shield\nOf girls comin round with the MC sound\nWill agree it's me, (??) just around\nJust listen to the S-K-V\nAnd ain't another MC messin with me\nEven though I got my haircut, down to wreck your body\nAnd make all your girls shake your butt\nJust listen don't be missin cause I won't be dissin\nOn Z-100, Hot 97\nKISS and 'BLS'n I got the profession of\n{*beatboxing*} AHH AHH AHH, BPP, ah one, chk two and\nThe lesson with the rhyme of a MC time\nWill agree it's me, Aries is my sign\nI said that say once, I'm not a dunce\nIt don't matter to me, nu-ance\nWas a per-fume, go and consume\nIs it because I'm Biz and I'm in a room\nJust (??) to my vocal, I'm not a local\nI'm Biz, you can call me a yokel\nI'm not from California, I'm not from Kansas City\nI'm not not part of the itty titty bittie\nCommittee with the rhyme, you will agree it's me\nThe original, M-U-D, D-F-double-O-T hey it's me\nAhh, ahh, P-E-C-E-E\nI spell it wrong goin on\nTo the break of dawn, word is bond\nIt sound kind of funky, don't it Kevin?\n'Member when me and you used to go to 7/11\n.. when Shelton worked there?\nHe used to give us food, and he was fair\nNot because we was on the wel-fare\nJust because we were down, and we didn't care\nBut now I'm a millionaire makin my rap\nAnd I'm freakin that dance,

Emezah-A\nShe said she know my reputation, know I got clout\nAnd like to get to know me, without no doubt\nSo we started havin long telephone conversations\nTryin to feel each other out, showin a lot of patience\nWas a hook-up from my man, word bond she was bad\nIf I met her whole family I would kiss her dad\nSo in my mind I was thinkin she really liked me\nShe got a good head on her shoulder and she's no dummy\nMe and her, had compatible horoscopes\nBut she bugged me out so bad I was on the ropes\nNow when I was with her, my shoulders shrugged\nBecause when I reached out for a kiss and hug\nShe mushed me in my face, and smiles with a grin\nAnd said this question\n\n[Chorus]\nWhy can't we be friends?  We can't we be friends?\nWhy can't we, be, friends?  We can't we be friends?\nWhy can't we be friends?  We can't we be friends?\nWhy can't we, be, friends?  We can't we be friends?\n\n[Verse Two]\nI knew she was different, a very special gal\nFor the time being, hmm I shall\nRespect her wishes, she wasn't a groupie\nI understand, she said she just had met me\nI liked her for that, a woman with morals\nShe called me every day, so I saw she was loyal\nIt bugged me out cause I don't usually wait\nBut on a scale of one to ten she was a twenty-eight\nWe was goin out on the reg', movies and dinner\nAlways stay at my house, way past ten o', clock\nI thought she really really liked me\nI did the right thing, like my name was Spike Lee\nShe had her own car so I walked her to the door\nLike Busta Rhymes I said, \"Gimme Some More\"\nSo I put my lips out, to get a kiss\nAnd she said just like this\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse Three]\nI knew somethin was wrong because my mack is correct\nTalkin for six months and didn't hit it yet?\nI thought I was slippin, or maybe in a slump\nI felt like Eddie Murphy when he was Professor Klump\nNaw it can't be, she's here every day\nSo I don't know why she'd wanna treat me this way\nI gotta investigate like Magnum P.I\nI just don't understand, why oh why\nSo the next time I saw her she was unhappy\nShe had a frown on her face and real jumpy\nI said, \"Yo what's wrong?\"  I was real concerned\nThe way she looked her life had took a real turn\nShe said, \"I went to court today,\" and I said, \"What?\"\n\"If I tell you this, you're gonna go nut\"\nI said, \"Tell me I can take it I won't pretend\"\n\"I gotta go to jail for life, so..\"\n\n[Chorus]", "image":

"lyrics": "[Verse One]\nI saw this girl from like around the way\nI told her I was the B-I-Z Emezah-A\nShe said she know my reputation, know I got clout\nAnd like to get to know me, without no doubt\nSo we started havin long telephone conversations\nTryin to feel each other out, showin a lot of patience\nWas a hook-up from my man, word bond she was bad\nIf I met her whole family I would kiss her dad\nSo in my mind I was thinkin she really liked me\nShe got a good head on her shoulder and she's no dummy\nMe and her, had compatible horoscopes\nBut she bugged me out so bad I was on the ropes\nNow when I was with her, my shoulders shrugged\nBecause when I reached out for a kiss and hug\nShe mushed me in my face, and smiles with a grin\nAnd said this question\n\n[Chorus]\nWhy can't we be friends?  We can't we be friends?\nWhy can't we, be, friends?  We can't we be friends?\nWhy can't we be friends?  We can't we be friends?\nWhy can't we, be, friends?  We can't we be friends?\n\n[Verse Two]\nI knew she was different, a very special gal\nFor the time being, hmm I shall\nRespect her wishes, she wasn't a groupie\nI understand, she said she just had met me\nI liked her for that, a woman with morals\nShe called me every day, so I saw she was loyal\nIt bugged me out cause I don't usually wait\nBut on a scale of one to ten she was a twenty-eight\nWe was goin out on the reg', movies and dinner\nAlways stay at my house, way past ten o', clock\nI thought she really really liked me\nI did the right thing, like my name was Spike Lee\nShe had her own car so I walked her to the door\nLike Busta Rhymes I said, \"Gimme Some More\"\nSo I put my lips out, to get a kiss\nAnd she said just like this\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse Three]\nI knew somethin was wrong because my mack is correct\nTalkin for six months and didn't hit it yet?\nI thought I was slippin, or maybe in a slump\nI felt like Eddie Murphy when he was Professor Klump\nNaw it can't be, she's here every day\nSo I don't know why she'd wanna treat me this way\nI gotta investigate like Magnum P.I\nI just don't understand, why oh why\nSo the next time I saw her she was unhappy\nShe had a frown on her face and real jumpy\nI said, \"Yo what's wrong?\"  I was real concerned\nThe way she looked her life had took a real turn\nShe said, \"I went to court today,\" and I said, \"What?\"\n\"If I tell you this, you're gonna go nut\"\nI said, \"Tell me I can take it I won't pretend\"\n\"I gotta go to jail for life, so..\"\n\n[Chorus]"}}, {"title": "Dedication", "album": "The Biz Never Sleeps", "year": "1989-10-10", "lyrics": "This is dedicated to you\nYou and you\n[Mr. Do It 2 Death talking]\nSo you wanna spread a lot of talk about my city Milwaukee huh\nAll that talk about Laverne and Shirley\nHappy Days, all that bullshit\nWhat the ***** ya think, ain't no niggas here\nWe got something fo ya mutha *****as\nI got something fo ya mutha *****as\n\n[Chorus]\nYou've been hatin' on my city fo a while\nNow we had to shout y'all down\nAnd if you don't let us thru the do'\nWe gonna go get the 4-4\nOh act like you didn't know\nFrom you bustas to you suckas to you hoes\nI know one thang fo sho\nBetta not bring your ass around my city\n[Coo Coo Cal talking]\nAll my Thug P niggas, all my Hillside niggas\nAll my Lincoln Park niggas, all my tre-8 niggas\n[Mr. Do It 2 Death talking]\nAll my 4-5 niggas, all my 2-6 niggas\nMy tre-4 niggas, my 4-8 niggas\n[Coo Coo Cal talking]\nAll my Eastside niggas, all my Northline nigaz\nAll my Parklawn niggas, all my North Meadow niggas\n[Mr. Do It 2 Death talking]\nAll my Hillside niggas, my 2-8 niggas\nMy 2nd & Keith niggas, all my Rest In Peace niggas\n\n[Verse 1: Coo Coo Cal]\nIt's Milwaukee Wis-consin, stompin' over the game of rap\nGot lil' pimp in us, (?) got game and a strap\nIt's where the thugs stay and drugs lay\nBut hungry hoes will pack your shit and turn some tricks\nCuz we won't budge babe, we play the game till the last quarter\nIf money drop like the spot then you can't leave till the last boulder\nWe gettin' older, and wise 'n rise wit advengance\nPuttin away then 'lacs and comin back slid'n in dem Benz's\nWe blowin' up like the World Trade\nHalf of the scratch we pack\nCome from rap, and all the rest your girl made\nSo if we don't see you at the top\nWavin' hangin outta drop dawg\nBumpin one of my songs that got the game on lock\nTop of the charts with this hardest rap\nIt's Coo Coo Cal chap representin Milwaukee where I started at\nWhoever thought of that of us bubblin up like champaigne\nRidin' thru your city on dem thangs nigga, fo real\n\n[Chorus]\nAin't been to the city in awhile\nNow we had to shout y'all down\nAnd if you don't let us thru the do'\nWe'll have to go and get the 4-4\nOh act like y'all didn't know\nFrom the west to the sucka city hoes\nI know one thang fo sho\nYa betta not bring your ass hoe\n[Mr. Do It 2 Death talking]\nAll my 2-9 niggas, my 8-tre niggas\nAll my 1-4, 1-5, and 1-9 niggas\n[Coo Coo Cal talking]\nAll my 86 niggas, my 6-tre niggas\nMy 2-4 niggas and my 1-9 nigga\n[Mr. Do It 2 Death talking]\nAll my eye-to-eye niggas, my stumpdown niggas\nMy Infinite 4-5 niggas and Block Mob niggas\n[Coo Coo Cal talking]\nAll my O.P. niggas, my PPD niggas\nMy 2-7 niggas, and dem 4-5 niggas\n\n[Verse 2: Mr. Do It 2 Death]\nNigga, ***** what ya heard, Milwaukee County 'till they down me\nDo It 2 Death Midwest you know how my town be niggas\nBig pimpin', ridin' 20 inches\nTwerkin in Excursion, workin dem thirty-sixes\nPimps up, hoes down...

rap technique is most very unique\nYour toes start to squeak, by the way that I speak\nMy rhymes are more sporty than the ESPN\nAnd the way that I spit, you like again and again\nFrom here to the Hima', I'm like a Lil' Kim-ah\n+Notorious+ and glorious, way above the rim-ah\nI'm not a gangster rapper, and I don't get freaky\nNever drunk or high or don't a-smoke ciggys\nI'm just self-assertive, BORN crazy\nWhen I came out my momma they said, \"A whoopsy daisy!\"\nAs you see, you know I, I keep it goin\nSo take it from me, HA, the king of disco'n\n\n[Chorus: repeat 2X]\nGet down, so get on down, get get on down\n\"I'm bound to wreck your body\" - get, you gotta get on down\nGet down, get on down, get get on down\n\"I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out\"\n\n[Verse Two]\nI'm the type of guy that be keepin it hot\nWherever you see me, I be rockin the spot\nBig belly and all, y'all be havin a ball\nPeople gather round me like I'm Pope John Paul\nWe can't party like it's 1999 no more\nCause it's 2 2 baby, and the future's in store\nSo let, olden way-s be forgotten\nAnd felt just grab a girl cause she's soft as cotton\nGet on the dance floor, back that ass up girl\nAnd act like you don't have a care in the world\nRock around the clock, hickory dickory dock\nShout to B.I.G., 'Pac, L, Tah and Scott LaRock\nI'm glad I made it to the Y2K\nSo what can I say?  Salate!\nYou look at me funny and say, \"Whadda you say?\"\nI'm the B-I-Z Emezzah-A-R-K\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse Three]\nGet down, get on down, withzzzah\nInhuman Orchestra that you would prefer\nSingin funky records for him or her\nOnly thing to say is I'm spectacular\nLet me get busy so I can make you dance\nShake and bake and put you in a trance\nMake you forget all your stress for five minutes or less\nLike a vacation in Jamaica or France\nHave you happy and jumpin for joy\nWhether you man, woman girl or a boy\nYou will agree, it ain't no other like the B-I-Z\nI'm up with the Jones, like my name's Roy\nBut, yo, no, it's got to be the Original\nMilky like cereal, funky fresh material\nThe L.I.'er for yo' desire\nBut right about now, I gotta retire\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Biz Markie]\nYour moms'll save this like your name is Sammy Davis\nCause I'm guaranteed to rock the microphone\nAnd hit you like {?}\nI don't gotta bald head\nBut I'm guaranteed to rock and spread love\nSuper educated from above\nMC guaranteed to hold you just like a glove\nI'm not Johnny Bench\nBut I hit yo' ass with a big-ass wrench\nBiz!"}}, {"title": "I Told You", "album": "I Need a Haircut", "year": "1991-08-27", "lyrics": "This is for those who didn't believe\nThat me, myself they said I couldn't achieve\nMy goal or even get to my destiny\nTo be the S-K-B-I-Z\nIt was a rough road, for me to pursue a\nCareer in rap to make you say hallelujah\nFor those who did, I'm not talkin to you\nCause I couldn't be there with-out you\nEverytime I see you they always say\nI knew you was gonna make hits someday\nBut then when I was strugglin hard, word\nA peep of help from them was never heard\nI always knew that, I was gonna make it\nNo matter how much beef and aggravation I take it\nAnd if you try to hold back me and my crew\nRemember, I told you..\nI told you..\n\nI'ma give you one incedent from my past\nWhen I had short money, goofy pants off my ass\nI used to go to block parties my cousin had served\nAnd see how people who made it, kicked OTHERs to the curb\nAnd then I said if I was in their spotlight\nI would treat everybody, equally right\nTo get where I'm at now, I used to hand out flyers\nFrom school to school, for New York and L.I.ers\nIt was me and Mike from Ike and then they used to do it\nHe said if you wanna be like them you gotta keep to it\nSo I kept at it, cause it was hard work\nI told em I was makin a record, they gave me a smirk\nLike if I was incapable of doin the deed\nOr virtually impossible for me to succeed\nYou must be crazy if I wouldn't pursue\nOnly thing that I can tell you is I told you..\nI told you..\n\nNow now now this is how it's endin\nJust like any other story, it is splendid\nI said to Ty if you let me come out with a cut\nThey will never ever stop shakin they butts\nSo I came out with \"Make the Music With Your Mouth Biz\"\nAn introduction to me, and told it like it is\nSome said it was beginner's luck, with this record\nThen I showed em with \"Nobody Beats the Biz\" and got respected\nI threw em off with my song \"Pickin Boogers\"\nIt was acquired taste, for different kind of sugars\nI got international like twin skyscrapers\nWith my album \"Goin' Off\" and my single \"The Vapors\"\nSince I produced my own, they said it would end\nCause it took a year and half to come out with \"Just a Friend\"\nIt went platinum, my album went gold\nAltogether it was one point five records sold\nSo don't EVER try to hold back me and my crew\nOnly thing that I can say is, I told you..\nI told you..\n\nSo when anybody try to, mess with your head\nJust go for what you wanna go for in life, aight?

goal or even get to my destiny\nTo be the S-K-B-I-Z\nIt was a rough road, for me to pursue a\nCareer in rap to make you say hallelujah\nFor those who did, I'm not talkin to you\nCause I couldn't be there with-out you\nEverytime I see you they always say\nI knew you was gonna make hits someday\nBut then when I was strugglin hard, word\nA peep of help from them was never heard\nI always knew that, I was gonna make it\nNo matter how much beef and aggravation I take it\nAnd if you try to hold back me and my crew\nRemember, I told you..\nI told you..\n\nI'ma give you one incedent from my past\nWhen I had short money, goofy pants off my ass\nI used to go to block parties my cousin had served\nAnd see how people who made it, kicked OTHERs to the curb\nAnd then I said if I was in their spotlight\nI would treat everybody, equally right\nTo get where I'm at now, I used to hand out flyers\nFrom school to school, for New York and L.I.ers\nIt was me and Mike from Ike and then they used to do it\nHe said if you wanna be like them you gotta keep to it\nSo I kept at it, cause it was hard work\nI told em I was makin a record, they gave me a smirk\nLike if I was incapable of doin the deed\nOr virtually impossible for me to succeed\nYou must be crazy if I wouldn't pursue\nOnly thing that I can tell you is I told you..\nI told you..\n\nNow now now this is how it's endin\nJust like any other story, it is splendid\nI said to Ty if you let me come out with a cut\nThey will never ever stop shakin they butts\nSo I came out with \"Make the Music With Your Mouth Biz\"\nAn introduction to me, and told it like it is\nSome said it was beginner's luck, with this record\nThen I showed em with \"Nobody Beats the Biz\" and got respected\nI threw em off with my song \"Pickin Boogers\"\nIt was acquired taste, for different kind of sugars\nI got international like twin skyscrapers\nWith my album \"Goin' Off\" and my single \"The Vapors\"\nSince I produced my own, they said it would end\nCause it took a year and half to come out with \"Just a Friend\"\nIt went platinum, my album went gold\nAltogether it was one point five records sold\nSo don't EVER try to hold back me and my crew\nOnly thing that I can say is, I told you..\nI told you..\n\nSo when anybody try to, mess with your head\nJust go for what you wanna go for in life, aight?

"lyrics": "One two, one two\nYou're listenin to the grand groovin sounds\nOf the diabolical energetical B-I-Z\nEmmezah-A-Rrrah-K\nAnd this goes out to my DJ\nThe cutmaster that no one cuts faster than\nC-double-oh-L V\nDrumroll V\n\n[Verse One]\nIt's a different kind of sound that's in the air\nIt's not shots, firecrackers, or a car that's there\nA little different noise for your listenin pleasure\nA sample from a record that's a four bar measure\nAdults think this music is just a big headache\nThey think all this hard work, is just a piece of cake\nThey must be buggin, right out of they socks\nWhy don't they get up and try to do, the human beatbox\nCause back in the days when there was just block parties\nA DJ would set up his equipment, and start these\nLive performances, and DJ tricks\nA lot of different DJ's was on the mix\nIt is a proven fact, music is a universal language\nFrom the tip of Long Island to the Verrezano Bridge\nWe won awards and served them by the millions\nThe more more years go by, the more we be killin 'em\nThey said it's just a fad, it will never last a year\nAll of a sudden, ten years later - \"I hear music\"\n\n[Chorus: Cool V scratches \"I hear music in the street\" over and over]\n\nCool V, give me a drum roll\n\n[Verse Two]\nI can't believe how hip-hop has progressed\nWith more and more groups that have finesse\nWe have groups on the East and West coast with different names\nWe all play a part if we didn't we'd go in flames\nWe all got to stick together as one\nBut at the same time, still have fun\nCause you don't wanna lose the love for the music\nWhen you have it keep it, and make use of it\nThis is a lesson from the S-K Biz\nCause nobody else is gonna tell you like it is\nEveryone thought that rap was just a phase\nBut it still continue, to muse and amaze\nIt gives people chance to show they true talents\nInstead of submittin to the crime and violence\nPeople said to me the S-K-B\nIs rap gonna stay until infinity?\nAs long as me and V be makin up the beats\nYou will hear people sayin - \"I hear music\"\n\n[Chorus]\n\nCool V, give me a drum roll\n\n[Verse Three]\nThis is the ending, conclusion, kapiche?\nOf this new hip-hop masterpiece\nAbout people countin chickens before they're hatched\nRecollatin on somethin that they can't match\nThey're creatin sounds of a hip-hop human bein\nWhether you're American or European\nOr even if you're from the West or East coast\nI'd like to thank all of you, save the most\nDon't diss each other by sayin who's better\nJust do it the best way, and stick together\nWith different rhyme techniques and DJ cuts\nAnd be crazy ambitious, and have a lot of guts\nAnd the people buyin, thanks for your support\nCause if it wasn't for you, we'd all fall short\nAs long as there's radio, cars and jeeps\nYou know what you will hear?\n\n[Chorus]\n\nWhat, what?  What, what what what what?\nYo V, yo yo what what what what what what what you hear?\nI can't hear you man, scratch it up one mo' time!\nYo what you hear?\nYo Paul Sea, yo yo, what wha-what you hear?\nYo Godfather D, I ain't hear what he said, what you hear?"}}, {"title": "Road Block", "album": "I Need a Haircut", "year": "1991-08-27", "lyrics": "Yo Doc, drop the beat in!\n\nThis is a incident that always occur\nWith the opposite sex, other word is her\nNo matter what nationality color or creed\nOr wherever you at, there's always a bad seed\nThey're always talkin about wantin to be alone\nYou're spendin too much time witcha friends, all night long\nI'm sayin yo what the heck, I am single\nIt's no reason why I shouldn't try to mingle\nSo I met this girl by the name of Maxine\nHer breath didn't stink she used Listerine\nShe looked crazy a-ight, and the whole nine\nBut this situation was one of a kind\nBecause I wanted her.. all to my own\nSo I called her on, my Mickey Mouse telephone\nI said, \"Hello pretty momma it's the guy you just me\nUhh what are you doin tonight?\"  She said, \"Nuttin,\" I said, \"Bet\"\nSo when I went to pick her up, I was in shock\nCause she brought her friend along for a ROAD BLOCK\n\n\t[Biz sings]\n\tAMERICAN WOMAN!  Why you do it to MEEEEEE?\n\tAMERICAN WOMAN!  Why you do it to MEEEEEE?\n\tIs it because I'm the BIZMARKIE?\n\tNo I think it's because I have the R-A-P\n\tI think you think I'm UGLY makin CASH MONEY\n\tYo I think all the girls is funny..\n\tAMERICAN WOMAN!  Why you do it to MEEEEEE?\n\tAMERICAN WOMAN!  Why you do it to MEEEEEE?\n\n(Yo Biz you know you don't usually be with things like that\nWhy you let her get away with that?)\nI thought she was buggin just to see what I'd say\nI said nuttin, let her friend come anyway\nOkay now listen what she wanted me to for her friend\n(What she want Biz?)  Expected me to pay her way in?\nIt's not like kid from stingy cheap or my name's Ebenezer\nBut I'm here to please Maxine, not to please her\nSo I still let it go by, and got her in the movie\nThank the Lord I bumped into my cousin named Cool V\nI said please Vaughn, take her friend off my hands\nSo I can be alone, and get my man\nHe said alright I'll introduce, she act like she was wit it\nBut when we try to split, she looked and said forget it\nI don't know whassup Vaughn, she must be buggin\nI thought you was in the way she was kissin and huggin\nSoon as I said - wanna make music like Sebastian Bach?\nI'm not leavin my friend with a guy but it's another road block\n\n\t[Biz sings]\n\tAMERICAN WOMAN!  Stay away from MEEEEEE!\n\tAMERICAN WOMAN!  Why you do it to MEEEEEE?\n\tIs it because I'm the BIZMARKIE?\n\tNo I think it's because I can R-A-P, no\n\tI think you think I'm UGLY makin CASH MONEY\n\tAll of this is funny..\n\tAMERICAN WOMAN!  Stay away from MEEEEEE!\n\tAMERICAN WOMAN!  Stay away from MEEEEEE!\n\nSo I was highly upset, and you would be too\nIf an icicle's in your way, stickin to you like glue\nI mean it's the end of the night, time to move on\nI'm tryin to kick ballistics so she'd come to my home\nI went to, yo bust it, call her when you get to your crib\nShe said, no and started cryin like a baby with a bib\nNow why you wanna bat me up and ruin my night?\nI coulda said no but I was bein polite\nShe tried to pull the I'm stayin over her house bit\nNot tonight baby you gon' be stayin at a Parkway Exit\nSo they went into the bathroom to get in a huddle\nIf you keep playin you're both gonna take the shuttle\nThey both came out the bathroom with a glance\nLike the bathroom they were goin to dance\nThey both approached me with the look of a rock\nI look and tell my senses ahh it's another road block..", "image": "https://images.genius.com/40f66b653cd7b106d8dea9f33eac5a75.598x598x1.jpg", "artist": "Biz Markie", "raw": {"annotation_count": 1,

sex, other word is her\nNo matter what nationality color or creed\nOr wherever you at, there's always a bad seed\nThey're always talkin about wantin to be alone\nYou're spendin too much time witcha friends, all night long\nI'm sayin yo what the heck, I am single\nIt's no reason why I shouldn't try to mingle\nSo I met this girl by the name of Maxine\nHer breath didn't stink she used Listerine\nShe looked crazy a-ight, and the whole nine\nBut this situation was one of a kind\nBecause I wanted her.. all to my own\nSo I called her on, my Mickey Mouse telephone\nI said, \"Hello pretty momma it's the guy you just me\nUhh what are you doin tonight?\"  She said, \"Nuttin,\" I said, \"Bet\"\nSo when I went to pick her up, I was in shock\nCause she brought her friend along for a ROAD BLOCK\n\n\t[Biz sings]\n\tAMERICAN WOMAN!  Why you do it to MEEEEEE?\n\tAMERICAN WOMAN!  Why you do it to MEEEEEE?\n\tIs it because I'm the BIZMARKIE?\n\tNo I think it's because I have the R-A-P\n\tI think you think I'm UGLY makin CASH MONEY\n\tYo I think all the girls is funny..\n\tAMERICAN WOMAN!  Why you do it to MEEEEEE?\n\tAMERICAN WOMAN!  Why you do it to MEEEEEE?\n\n(Yo Biz you know you don't usually be with things like that\nWhy you let her get away with that?)\nI thought she was buggin just to see what I'd say\nI said nuttin, let her friend come anyway\nOkay now listen what she wanted me to for her friend\n(What she want Biz?)  Expected me to pay her way in?\nIt's not like kid from stingy cheap or my name's Ebenezer\nBut I'm here to please Maxine, not to please her\nSo I still let it go by, and got her in the movie\nThank the Lord I bumped into my cousin named Cool V\nI said please Vaughn, take her friend off my hands\nSo I can be alone, and get my man\nHe said alright I'll introduce, she act like she was wit it\nBut when we try to split, she looked and said forget it\nI don't know whassup Vaughn, she must be buggin\nI thought you was in the way she was kissin and huggin\nSoon as I said - wanna make music like Sebastian Bach?\nI'm not leavin my friend with a guy but it's another road block\n\n\t[Biz sings]\n\tAMERICAN WOMAN!  Stay away from MEEEEEE!\n\tAMERICAN WOMAN!  Why you do it to MEEEEEE?\n\tIs it because I'm the BIZMARKIE?\n\tNo I think it's because I can R-A-P, no\n\tI think you think I'm UGLY makin CASH MONEY\n\tAll of this is funny..\n\tAMERICAN WOMAN!  Stay away from MEEEEEE!\n\tAMERICAN WOMAN!  Stay away from MEEEEEE!\n\nSo I was highly upset, and you would be too\nIf an icicle's in your way, stickin to you like glue\nI mean it's the end of the night, time to move on\nI'm tryin to kick ballistics so she'd come to my home\nI went to, yo bust it, call her when you get to your crib\nShe said, no and started cryin like a baby with a bib\nNow why you wanna bat me up and ruin my night?\nI coulda said no but I was bein polite\nShe tried to pull the I'm stayin over her house bit\nNot tonight baby you gon' be stayin at a Parkway Exit\nSo they went into the bathroom to get in a huddle\nIf you keep playin you're both gonna take the shuttle\nThey both came out the bathroom with a glance\nLike the bathroom they were goin to dance\nThey both approached me with the look of a rock\nI look and tell my senses ahh it's another road block.."}}, {"title": "Biz in Harmony", "album": "The Biz Never Sleeps", "year": "1989-10-10", "lyrics": "Ah yeah\nThe diabolical is back again\nBut now I want

She cut me off so tough and\nI gotta call you back - aww baby, you busy doin NUTTIN\n\nChorus: BizMarkie's crew and the Diabolical\n\n\tB.D.N., B.D.N., B (repeat 2X)\n\tYou're busy doin NUTTIN\n\tB.D.N., B.D.N., B (repeat 2X)\n\tYou're busy doin NUTTIN\n\tB.D.N., B.D.N., B (repeat 2X)\n\tYou're busy doin NUTTIN\n\tB.D.N., B.D.N., B\n\tB.D.N., B.D.N., BEEEEEEE!!\n\n[BizMarkie]\nLet me tell you a story bout a girl named Gilda\nShe was from out of state, I was wonderin will the\nSame thing happen to me like the deja vu\nLet me keep quiet, and go into a tale\nSee I was chillin at the Chapter 3\nWord is bond she looked divine, she looked as fly as can be\nI thought she was different cause she was by herself\nShe looked real wholesome, and in good physical health\nI walked by, she said hi\nAin't you the B-I-Z-the-emmaza-emmaza-A-R-K-I\nI said yes can I have the number to your home\nAre you allowed to call Jersey on your phone?\nShe chuckled we exchanged, I went home joked about it\nHow she was gonna be mine, with no doubt about it\nBut everytime I call I say whassup muffin?\nI'm doin somethin now - aww baby, you busy doin NUTTIN\n\nChorus\n\n[BizMarkie]\nAhhhh, don't give me that!\nThe last episode was at a club in the Bronx\nI was rockin with Capri who got a good response\nIt was Backspin June, and Limo Driver Mike\nYou chill in the car, cause clubs he didn't like\nSo me and V went in just to look around\nSeein girls that had bass with sense around\nThen we all got on stage and rocked the house\nThere were no fights in, not even out\nSlide, then we got in the car\nSaw two trillzadills shinin like a star\nOne was with Mike, the other was with June\nYo it's not gonna be theirs for soon\nSo V got with Mike and hooked me with her sister\nIf I knew she was like that, I woulda had dissed her\nCause everytime me and V called them both up and\nThey both were busy?!  Nah - they're busy doin NUTTIN\n\nChorus 3X\n\n[BizMarkie - speaking over last 2X]\nAhhhh, don't even give me that!\nThat's junk\nThis goes out to all you bitches doin nuttin\nKa-ka-cause that's all

wasn't thought about\n\nAnd the teachers they thought I was crazy without a doubt\n\nI guess they didn't understand what I was comin from\n\nSince I was into MC'n, they thought I was dumb\nThen there was a teacher by the name of Ms. K Parke\n\nSince I was good at rememberin numbers she said I was smart\n\nBut that don't got nothin to do with this rendezvous\n\nAnd THAT'S why I sing this song to

Bunanan Street, and go to the house of the crew\n\nI would walk from C.I., to Bay Shore\n\nJust to see if I really had the rhymes galore\n\nI'd go to house parties here, go to house parties there\n\nWalk the ?? ?? pants off my derriere\n\nLike if I was David Carridine who played \"Kung Fu\"\n\nWho would walk from China to Japan without a shoe\n\nHummin beats, sayin rhymes, kept me goin\n\nFrom givin up or bein crazy, or just stop flowin\n\nMy teachers and parents said, I should just stop\n\nJust go to army go to college get a job witcha POPS?!\n\nI can't take no more of this

skid\n\nOnly thing he had was Pat and Turner\n\nHe didn't know the future but the lesson to learn-ah\n\nWay to get started in the music biz\n\nJust listen to the story as I tell it like it is\n\nI was a youngster from East Junior High School\n\nWho thought somebody with Adidas sweat-shirt was cool\n\nIt symbolized somethin, but I don't know\n\nI wanted to be down really really bad so\n\nI asked one of my best friends Derek Mangareu\n\n\"C'mon man can I be down can I be down witcha crew?\"\nHe had one by the name of Masters of Control\n\nI wanted to be down, so I could play the role\n\nHe said, \"No you're not good enough we have ours Mark\"\n\nI went home and sat in the room with no lights in the dark\n\nAnd this is gonna be a rough rendezvous\n\nAnd that's why I sing this song to you\n\n\nI'm a lonely soldier.. yeah..\n\nMany miles from home..\n\nWith a heart that's heavy..\n\nAnd with.. a will that's strong\n\n\nI got a little older, three years to be exact\n\nWhen a crew named Midnight Express gave me a crack\n\nIt consist of one MC and two DJ's\n\nAnd the way Kevin D cut had me amazed\n\nIt was like I just joined the Lakers\n\nOr even Rock Steady or the New York City Breakers\n\nI was in 11th grade, at ?? High\n\nThey was sayin they was sayin hey what's wrong with this guy\n\nBecause all he do, is bang on tables and mumble\n\nAnd doin music with his mouth like a band ensemble\nOr the human beatbox wasn't thought about\n\nAnd the teachers they thought I was crazy without a doubt\n\nI guess they didn't understand what I was comin from\n\nSince I was into MC'n, they thought I was dumb\nThen there was a teacher by the name of Ms. K Parke\n\nSince I was good at rememberin numbers she said I was smart\n\nBut that don't got nothin to do with this rendezvous\n\nAnd THAT'S why I sing this song to you!\n\n\nI'm a lonely soldier.. yeah..\n\nMany miles from home..\n\nWith a heart that's heavy..\n\nAnd with.. a will that's strong\n\n\nI was a walkin son of a gun before the day I begun\n\nI'mma tell you how it started, from day one\n\nWell me, I lived in ]??[, they lived in C.I\n\nI was ambitious and devoted til the day I'd die\n\nI used to get on Fair Islip, take the S-42\n\nGet off at Bunanan Street, and go to the house of the crew\n\nI would walk from C.I., to Bay Shore\n\nJust to see if I really had the rhymes galore\n\nI'd go to house parties here, go to house parties there\n\nWalk the ?? ?? pants off my derriere\n\nLike if I was David Carridine who played \"Kung Fu\"\n\nWho would walk from China to Japan without a shoe\n\nHummin beats, sayin rhymes, kept me goin\n\nFrom givin up or bein crazy, or just stop flowin\n\nMy teachers and parents said, I should just stop\n\nJust go to army go to college get a job witcha POPS?!\n\nI can't take no more of this rendezvous\n\nAnd that's why I sing this song to you!\n\n\nI'm a lonely soldier.. yeah..\n\nMany miles from home..\n\nWith a heart that's heavy..\n\nAnd with.. a will that's strong\n\n\nI'm a lonely soldier..\n\nMany miles from home..\n\nWith a heart that's heavy..\n\nAnd with.. a will that's strong"}}, {"title": "Nobody Beats the Biz (Special Marley Marl Remix)", "album": null, "year": null,

might sound confusing, the style that I'm using\nBut in the end I'm sure that you will find it quite amusing\nAnd funny, oh honey, it's just ridiculous\nDon't try to front, come on and admit you was\nThrilled, chilled, your heart was all filled\nSo respect the architect, as I begin to build\nScience and my reliance is upon my rap\nLike Carl Lewis I get to it, so let's go the lap...\n\nNobody beats the Biz\nNobody beats the Bizzzz\n(x3)\n\n(TJ Swan)\nNobody beats the Biz, nobody beats the Biz (x2)\nMy name is TJ Swan, nobody beats the Biz\nI rock you on and on, nobody beats the Biz\nYou know nobody that beats the Biz\nI know nobody that beats the Biz\nNobody beats the Biz, nobody beats the Biz (x2)\n\n(BizMarkie does some beatboxing)\n\n(TJ Swan verse resung in this version several

DJ's\nThat need, a record for them, knahmsayin?\nAnd it go like this\n[Biz Markie]\nOn your mark, get set, let's go\nI make you hit e'ry emcee you know\nYour eyes could not cover the whole damn place\nYou see everybody rockin from head to shoelace\nA DJ spinnin, that's me\nA DJ on the microphone, yeah that's me\nWhy you're havin a good time, that's me\nThe reason that you paid yo' money, is the party\nYou never heard a DJ wreck it like this\nWith a different twist still down to be on top of the list\nShoutout to all the DJ's who complete the craze\nFunkmaster Flex, and all the radio DJ's\nKaySlay to Clue and all with mixtapes\nMale or female, all size and shapes\nWe're the new wave of the Y2K\nFrom Flash, Theodore, Herc, from back in the day\n\n[Chorus: Lil' Kal]\nThis is for the, dee-jayyyyys, whoahhhh\nDJ's make the world go around go around go around\nMake you feel that funky sound\nThis is for the, dee-jayyyyys, whoahhhh\nDJ's make the world go around\nMake you feel that funky sound\n[Faison]\nDJ's got you dancin, music that they play is random\nMan you can't fathom\nMixtapes too, P Cutta too\nEnuff to S&S they got somethin new\nExclusive (exclusive) you know how they do\nThis music make your mind just lose it\nGirls shake that thang, have a good time\nHow the DJ got you feelin you can sing (uh)\nFellas grab a girl (grab a girl) grab her waist\nShow your face, move your hips and move to the bass\nGo to clubs cause of DJ's (DJ's)\nYou forget the he said she said when you hear the DJ\nOh they playin my song (playin my song)\nIt's one of them I gots to get it on I gots to move strong\nTime is windin down (windin down)\nDJ slow the music down cause I'm 'bout to get my grind on now\n\n[Chorus]\n[Biz Markie]\nThis is what I love to do\nBesides it bein a hobby, this is what I love to do\nI love to look for records, I love to play the records\nI love to, rock the crowd when they don't expect it\nLove to go to Chicago where they like house and club\nEven love Jamaica where they do the rub-a-dub\nI like B.More, V-A and D.C\nI can break it down and so on like I'm most definitely\nI can shake it in Miami, A-T-L and Carolinas\nBut New Orleans and Texas know my bounce is finer\nSt. Lou', Tennessee, Detroit, Philly to L.A\nThey know I par-tay to the break of day\nCan't forget Boston, Connecticut and across sea\nFrom England, Holland, German to the Japanese\nAll of them are great, like a cake, and a fork\nBut, I, LOVE, NEW YORRRRK\n\n[Chorus]"}}, {"title": "The Energy Blues", "album": "Schoolhouse Rock!

and drivin'\nReadin' and writin' and jivin'\nEnergy, you'd think we'd be savin' it up\n\n[Verse 2]\nEnergy, you can get it by dammin' up a river\nEnergy, a windmill can make the breeze deliver\nBut even with millin' and dammin'\nOur needs are so much more demanding\nEnergy, we have to use some kind of fuel\n\n[Verse 3]\nChop, chop, chop, the cavemen used wood to start their fires\nChop, chop, chop, they made all the tools that they required\nChop, chop, chop, inventions got more and more inspired\nThe fires got higher and higher\nAnd clearings got wider and wider\nEnergy, they were burnin' 'bout all their wood up\n\n[Verse 4]\nThen one day men discovered that coal would do it better\nMiners dug, and it looked like it might just last forever\nIt seemed like the final solution\nIt started an Industrial Revolution\nEnergy, we just keep on diggin' it up\n\n[Bridge]\nIn 1859, way out in western Pennsylvania\nA man had built a rig that got some laughs from folks who came there\nBut then suddenly, a mighty roar came up from the ground\nAnd soon a gusher gushed and soaked all who stood around\nNow no-one knew, who that gusher blew\nThe petroleum years were on us\nAnd that so many cars and trucks would come to cause a crisis\nAnd then!?\n\n[Verse 5]\nEnergy, we're looking to try and find some new kind of\nEnergy , exploring to try and make a new find of\nNuclear and thermal and solar\nIf we miss we'll get colder and colder\nEnergy, we've gotta stop usin' you up\n\n[Verse 6]\nSo don't be cross when momma says turn that extra light out\nJust turn it off till we find us a fuel that never runs out\nIf everyone tries a bit harder\nOur fuel will go farther and farther\nEnergy, we're gonna be stretchin' you out", "image":

awful lot for\nHeatin' and lightin' and drivin'\nReadin' and writin' and jivin'\nEnergy, you'd think we'd be savin' it up\n\n[Verse 2]\nEnergy, you can get it by dammin' up a river\nEnergy, a windmill can make the breeze deliver\nBut even with millin' and dammin'\nOur needs are so much more demanding\nEnergy, we have to use some kind of fuel\n\n[Verse 3]\nChop, chop, chop, the cavemen used wood to start their fires\nChop, chop, chop, they made all the tools that they required\nChop, chop, chop, inventions got more and more inspired\nThe fires got higher and higher\nAnd clearings got wider and wider\nEnergy, they were burnin' 'bout all their wood up\n\n[Verse 4]\nThen one day men discovered that coal would do it better\nMiners dug, and it looked like it might just last forever\nIt seemed like the final solution\nIt started an Industrial Revolution\nEnergy, we just keep on diggin' it up\n\n[Bridge]\nIn 1859, way out in western Pennsylvania\nA man had built a rig that got some laughs from folks who came there\nBut then suddenly, a mighty roar came up from the ground\nAnd soon a gusher gushed and soaked all who stood around\nNow no-one knew, who that gusher blew\nThe petroleum years were on us\nAnd that so many cars and trucks would come to cause a crisis\nAnd then!?\n\n[Verse 5]\nEnergy, we're looking to try and find some new kind of\nEnergy , exploring to try and make a new find of\nNuclear and thermal and solar\nIf we miss we'll get colder and colder\nEnergy, we've gotta stop usin' you up\n\n[Verse 6]\nSo don't be cross when momma says turn that extra light out\nJust turn it off till we find us a fuel that never runs out\nIf everyone tries a bit harder\nOur fuel will go farther and farther\nEnergy, we're gonna be stretchin' you out"}}, {"title": "Biz's

the night before, for a let-me-live\nThe way this day turned out wasn't my prerogative\nI went to the kitchen to get some cereal smooth as silk\nBut when I looked in the ice box, there wasn't no milk\nWell I don't need no breakfast, I'm too fat anyway\nI just grab a cup of juice and be on my way\nSo I got my car keys, on route to my job\nI walked out, my windows broken and my car got robbed\nThey took my radio and my favorite cassette\nWhat a way to start the day, aww - what's next?\nI get to the office, my boss starts to scream\nIt was really unbelievable, like a bad dream\nHe kept talkin all this blahse blahse\nAnd looked at me and said, \"What you have to say?\"\n\n(Chorus)\nI'm havin a bad day\nThings ain't goin my way\nI'm havin a bad day\nToday, today\n\n(Verse 2: Biz Markie)\nHere's somethin else that happened to me\nIn the middle of this day that's bein deep\nTo begin this era of grief and aggravation\nI was parked by a meter and still got a citation\nTook the ticket off my window, got in my car alright\nA cop pulled behind me at a red light\n\"Your licence, registration and insurance card\"\nI was buggin out cause it was really hard\nI didn't do nothin, asked, \"Why'd you pull me over?\nYou never saw a young man drive a Range Rover?\"\nHe let me go and said, \"Don't do it again\" - \"Why,\"\nI said, \"thank you officer, you been a nice guy\"\nSo I stopped at the store to get somethin to drink\nGuess what happened to me before I could blink\nThey had my truck in the air, just about to be towed\nFor $700 in tickets I owed\n\n(Chorus)\n\n(Verse 3: Biz Markie)\nAfter all that I could finally go home\nAnd rest my feet and get on the telephone\nI had a unbelievable time in the city\nI shoulda be down with the ( ? ) committee\nI tried to cook some dinner but it came out burnt\nThe fire was too hot, I just had learned\nSo freak it, I'll go to a restaurant\nI brought a girl with me, asked, \"What do you want?\"\n\"Shrimp and lobster, two bottles of Aliz\u00e9\"\nI looked at her and said, \"Hey hey hey!\"\nShe ate all the food and drank all of the liquor\nI better bring her home so I can stick her\nSo I got her to my house as fast as I

shock\nI think it's because I am the original B\nAin't no other MC like the B-I-Z Markie (hit it Kev)\nOn the guitar is my man Monty\nAnd Tex don't know how to dance for S-H-I-T (fuck you)\nBut everytime you hear me I am on the go\nRight there in Germany is my man Dajabo{?}\nEverytime you hear me rhyme, I know {?} how to sing\nThat's why a lot of girls cling to the ding-a-ling\n{*everyone
