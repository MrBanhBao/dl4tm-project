Andr\u00e9 said the following about the concept of this genre-bending song:\n\n\u201cHey Ya!\u201d is pretty much about the state of relationships in the 2000s. It\u2019s about some people who stay together in relationships because of tradition, because somebody told them, \u201cYou guys are supposed to stay together.\u201d But you pretty much end up being unhappy for the rest of your life.\n\nAndr\u00e9 also revealed another source of inspiration in the creation of the song:\n\nI had to tell Aretha Franklin that \u201cSay A Little Prayer\u201d had a lot to do with the song \u201cHey Ya!\u201d They\u2019re similar [time signatures]. It\u2019s hard to explain, but listening to that song, the way the loop comes back around, is kinda how I devised \u201cHey Ya.\u201d And I had to tell her that she is a big part of that song.\n\nEngineer Pete Novak said the following about the recording process:\n\nHe would do 30 or 40 takes of each line. [\u2026] We [recorded] a lot of vocals and lived with them and trashed them. There were so many different versions of that song. If I had the files, I could let you hear 20 different versions of that song. There were lots of ideas that were interesting, but I\u2019m happy with the way it turned it out. We had one of the verses with him singing through a vocoder. It was cool at the time, but it didn\u2019t really work.\n\nThe music video features Andr\u00e9 and his band The Love Below re-creating The Beatles' performance of \u201cI Want To Hold Your Hand\u201d on The Ed Sullivan Show from February 9, 1964. With Andre playing all the different members of the band, he had to perform the song 23 times so the video could be shot from multiple angles.\n\nThe single achieved platinum status and reached #1 on the pop charts in multiple countries, including the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. The music video won four awards at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards, including Video of the Year."}, "embed_content": "<div id='rg_embed_link_1449' class='rg_embed_link' data-song-id='1449'>Read <a

It also won the Grammy for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group in 2002.

this\n\n[Hook: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nI'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, I am for real\nNever meant to make your daughter cry\nI apologize a trillion times\nI'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, I am for real\nNever meant to make your daughter cry\nI apologize a trillion times\n\n[Verse 1: Big Boi]\nMy baby drama mama don't like me\nShe be doin' things like havin' them boys come from her neighborhood to the studio, tryna fight me\nShe need to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out\nThat's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out\nAnd let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check\nPrivate school, daycare, shit, medical bills\u2014I pay that\nI love your mom and everything\nBut see, I ain't the only one who laid down\nShe wanna rib you up to start a custody war\nMy lawyers stay down\nShit, you never got a chance to hear my side of the story\nWe was divided\nShe had fish fries and cookouts for my child's birthday\nI ain't invited, despite it\nI show her the utmost respect when I fall through\nAll you do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah\n\n[Hook]\nI'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, I am for real\nNever meant to make your daughter cry\nI apologize a trillion times\nI'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, I am for real\nNever meant to make your daughter cry\nI apologize a trillion times\n\n[Bridge: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nMe and your daughter got a special thing goin' on\nYou say it's puppy love, we say it's full-grown\nHope that we feel this, feel this way forever\nYou can plan a pretty picnic\nBut you can't predict the weather, Ms. Jackson\n\n[Verse 2: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nTen times out of nine, now if I'm lyin', find\nThe quickest muzzle, throw it on my mouth and I'll decline\nKing meets queen, then the puppy love thing\nTogether dream 'bout that crib with the Goodyear swing\nOn the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever\nForever, forever ever? Forever ever?\nForever never seems that long until you're grown\nAnd notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong\nMs. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could\nBecome a magician to abracadabra all the sadder\nThoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he\nAskin' what happened to the feelin' that her and me had\nI pray so much about it, need some knee pads\nIt happened for a reason, one can't be mad\nSo know this, know that everything's cool\nAnd yes, I will be present on the first day of school\nAnd graduation\n\n[Hook]\nI'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, I am for real\nNever meant to make your daughter cry\nI apologize a trillion times\nI'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, I am for real\nNever meant to make your daughter cry\nI apologize a trillion times\n\n[Verse 3: Big Boi]\n\"Look at the way he treats me\"\nShit, look at the way you treat me\nYou see, your little nosy-ass homegirls\nDone got your ass sent up the creek, G\nWithout a paddle, you left to straddle and ride this thing on out\nAnd I knew you and your girl ain't speakin' no more\n\u2018Cause my dick all in her mouth\nKnow what I'm talkin' about?\nJealousy, infidelity, envy, cheating, beating\nIn the year two to the G, they be the same thing\nSo who you placin' the blame on?\nYou keep on singin' the same song\nLet bygones be bygones, you can go on and get the hell on\nYou and your mama\n\n[Hook]\nI'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, I am for real\nNever meant to make your daughter cry\nI apologize a trillion times\nI'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, I am for real\nNever meant to make your daughter cry\nI apologize a trillion times\nI'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, I am for real\nNever meant to make your daughter cry\nI apologize a trillion times\nI'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, I am for real\nNever meant to make your daughter cry\nI apologize a trillion times"}}, {"title": "Roses", "album": "Speakerboxxx / The Love Below", "year": "2003-09-23", "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nCaroline (Caroline), see, Caroline\nAll the

reason for the word 'bitch' (bitch)\nI hope she's speedin' on the way to the club\nTryna hurry up to get to a baller or singer or somebody like that\nAnd try to put on her make up in the mirror and

weak\nTrickin' off this bitch is lost, must take me for a geek\nA quick way to eat, a neat place to sleep\nA rent-a-car for a week, a trick for a treat\nNo go on the raw sex, my AIDS test is flawless\nRegardless, we don't want to get involved with all them lawyers\nAnd judges just to hold grudges in a courtroom\nI wanna see your support bra, not support you\n(Not support you, not support

Familiar with that smack, man?\nThe music is like that green stuff provided to you by sack man\nPacman, how in the fuck do you think we gon' do that, man?\nRidin' round Old National on 18's without no gat, man\nI'm strapped, man, and ready to bust on any nigga like that, man\nMe and my nigga we roll together like Batman and Robin\nWe prayed together through hard times and swung hard when it was fitting\nBut now we tappin' the brakes from all them corners that we be bending\nIn Volkswagens and Bonnevilles, Chevrolets and Coupe de Villes\nIf you ain't got no rims, nigga, don't get no wood grain steering wheel\nFor real, you can go on chill out and still build, let your paper stack\nInstead of going into overkill, pay your fuckin' beeper bill, bitch\n\n[Chorus: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nEven the sun goes down, heroes eventually die\nHoroscopes often lie, and sometimes \"y\"\nNothin' is for sure, nothin' is for certain, nothin' lasts forever\nBut until they close the curtain, it's him and I: Aquemini\n\n[Verse 2: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nTwice upon a time, there was a boy who died\nAnd lived happily ever after, but that's another chapter\nLive from home of the brave with dirty dollars\nAnd beauty parlors and baby ballers and bowling ball Impalas\nAnd street scholars, majoring in culinary arts\nYou know, how to work bread, cheese, and dough\nFrom scratch, but see the catch is you can get caught\nKnow what ya selling, what you bought, so cut that big talk\nLet's walk to the bridge, meet me halfway\nNow you may see some children dead off in the pathway\nIt's them poor babies walkin' slowly to the candy lady\nIt's lookin' bad, need some hope, like the words 'maybe', 'if', or 'probably'\nMore than a hobby, when my turntables get wobbly, they don't fall\nI'm sorry y'all, I often drift, I'm talking gift\nSo when it comes you never look the horse inside its grill\nOf course you know I feel like the bearer of bad news\nDon't want to be it but it's needed, so what have you?\nNow question: is every nigga with dreads for the cause?\nIs every nigga with golds for the fall? Naw\nSo don't get caught up in appearance\nIt's OutKast's Aquemini, another black experience\n\n[Chorus: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nEven the sun goes down, heroes eventually die\nHoroscopes often lie, and sometimes 'y'\nNothin' is for sure, nothin' is for certain, nothin' lasts forever\nBut until they close the curtain, it's him and I: Aquemini\n\n[Verse 3: Big Boi]\nThe name is Big Boi, Daddy Fat Sax, the nigga that like them Cadillacs\nI stay down with these streets 'cause these streets is where my folks at\nBetter know dat, some say we pro-black, but we professional\nWe missed a lot of church so the music is our confessional\nGet off the testicles and the nutsacks\nYou bust rhyme, we bust back\nGet-get back for real niggas that's out here tryin' to spit facts\nYou hear dat? You can't come near dat, maybe you need to quit\nBecause Aquemini is Aquarius and  Gemini runnin' shit like this\n\n[Verse 4: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nMy mind warps and bends, floats the wind, count to ten\nMeet the twin\u2014Andr\u00e9 Ben, welcome to the lion's den\nOriginal skin, many men comprehend\nI extend myself so you go out and tell a friend\nSin all depends on what you believing in\nFaith is what you make it\u2014that's the hardest shit since MC Ren\nAlien can blend right on in with your kin\nLook again, 'cause I swear I spot one every now and then\nIt's happening again, wish I could tell you when\nAndr\u00e9, this is Andr\u00e9, y'all are just gon' have to make amends\n\n[Chorus: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nEven the sun goes down, heroes eventually die\nHoroscopes often lie, and sometimes \"y\"\nNothin' is for sure, nothin' is for certain, nothin' lasts forever\nBut until they close the curtain, it's him and I: Aquemini\n\n[Skit: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nMaster: Finally, Igor! We've done it, we've done it!\nIgor: Yes, master! Yes, master!\nMaster: Igor, we've done it!\nBoth: Uh-oh\n(Woman Screaming)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1d70ec18b556343d079f83245405002c.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "OutKast", "raw": {"annotation_count": 40, "api_path": "/songs/3459", "apple_music_id": "266365360", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/3459/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "The title track to OutKast\u2019s classic third album acknowledges that all great things must come to an end, but insists that Andr\u00e9 and Big Boi won\u2019t stop working together until that time comes.

Big Boi]\nNow is the time to get on, like Spike Lee said, \"Get on the Bus\"\nGo get your work and keep your beeper chirpin', it's a must\nIs you on that dust or cornstarch? Familiar with that smack, man?\nThe music is like that green stuff provided to you by sack man\nPacman, how in the fuck do you think we gon' do that, man?\nRidin' round Old National on 18's without no gat, man\nI'm strapped, man, and ready to bust on any nigga like that, man\nMe and my nigga we roll together like Batman and Robin\nWe prayed together through hard times and swung hard when it was fitting\nBut now we tappin' the brakes from all them corners that we be bending\nIn Volkswagens and Bonnevilles, Chevrolets and Coupe de Villes\nIf you ain't got no rims, nigga, don't get no wood grain steering wheel\nFor real, you can go on chill out and still build, let your paper stack\nInstead of going into overkill, pay your fuckin' beeper bill, bitch\n\n[Chorus: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nEven the sun goes down, heroes eventually die\nHoroscopes often lie, and sometimes \"y\"\nNothin' is for sure, nothin' is for certain, nothin' lasts forever\nBut until they close the curtain, it's him and I: Aquemini\n\n[Verse 2: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nTwice upon a time, there was a boy who died\nAnd lived happily ever after, but that's another chapter\nLive from home of the brave with dirty dollars\nAnd beauty parlors and baby ballers and bowling ball Impalas\nAnd street scholars, majoring in culinary arts\nYou know, how to work bread, cheese, and dough\nFrom scratch, but see the catch is you can get caught\nKnow what ya selling, what you bought, so cut that big talk\nLet's walk to the bridge, meet me halfway\nNow you may see some children dead off in the pathway\nIt's them poor babies walkin' slowly to the candy lady\nIt's lookin' bad, need some hope, like the words 'maybe', 'if', or 'probably'\nMore than a hobby, when my turntables get wobbly, they don't fall\nI'm sorry y'all, I often drift, I'm talking gift\nSo when it comes you never look the horse inside its grill\nOf course you know I feel like the bearer of bad news\nDon't want to be it but it's needed, so what have you?\nNow question: is every nigga with dreads for the cause?\nIs every nigga with golds for the fall? Naw\nSo don't get caught up in appearance\nIt's OutKast's Aquemini, another black experience\n\n[Chorus: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nEven the sun goes down, heroes eventually die\nHoroscopes often lie, and sometimes 'y'\nNothin' is for sure, nothin' is for certain, nothin' lasts forever\nBut until they close the curtain, it's him and I: Aquemini\n\n[Verse 3: Big Boi]\nThe name is Big Boi, Daddy Fat Sax, the nigga that like them Cadillacs\nI stay down with these streets 'cause these streets is where my folks at\nBetter know dat, some say we pro-black, but we professional\nWe missed a lot of church so the music is our confessional\nGet off the testicles and the nutsacks\nYou bust rhyme, we bust back\nGet-get back for real niggas that's out here tryin' to spit facts\nYou hear dat? You can't come near dat, maybe you need to quit\nBecause Aquemini is Aquarius and  Gemini runnin' shit like this\n\n[Verse 4: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nMy mind warps and bends, floats the wind, count to ten\nMeet the twin\u2014Andr\u00e9 Ben, welcome to the lion's den\nOriginal skin, many men comprehend\nI extend myself so you go out and tell a friend\nSin all depends on what you believing in\nFaith is what you make it\u2014that's the hardest shit since MC Ren\nAlien can blend right on in with your kin\nLook again, 'cause I swear I spot one every now and then\nIt's happening again, wish I could tell you when\nAndr\u00e9, this is Andr\u00e9, y'all are just gon' have to make amends\n\n[Chorus: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nEven the sun goes down, heroes eventually die\nHoroscopes often lie, and sometimes \"y\"\nNothin' is for sure, nothin' is for certain, nothin' lasts forever\nBut until they close the curtain, it's him and I: Aquemini\n\n[Skit: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nMaster: Finally, Igor!

And its structure \u2013 the last line (the O-YAY-ER) emerges perfectly, surprisingly rhyming with the first and second line \u2013 we would have expected the last line to rhyme with the third, but it rhymes with the other two.

"Fuck.  Where to begin.  Well, this song has an absolutely bangin beat.  Second, the verses provided by Big Boi and Andre are, as usual, outstanding.  And then\u2026\n\nTHE HOOK!  A stunningly perfect hook summarizing the ethos of the Southern rap lifestyle.  And its structure \u2013 the last line (the O-YAY-ER) emerges perfectly, surprisingly rhyming with the first and second line \u2013 we would have expected the last line to rhyme with the third, but it rhymes with the other two.  But, of course, to recognize exactly why this is so amazing you have to listen to it.  So stop reading my shit and start bangin!"}, "comment_count": 1, "community": true, "custom_preview": null, "has_voters": true, "id": 3491319, "pinned": false, "share_url":

I'm on the microphone you best to wear your sweater\nCause I'm cooler than a polar bear's toenails\n\"Oh hell, there he go again talking that shit\"\nBend, corners like I was a curve, I struck a nerve\nAnd now you 'bout to see this Southern playa serve\nI heard it's not where you're from but where you pay rent\nThen I heard it's not what you make but how much you spent\nYou got me bent like elbows, amongst other things, but I'm not worried\nCause when we step up in the party; like a mouse, you scurry\nSo go get your fucking shine box and your sack of nickels\nIt tickles to see you try to be like Mr. Pickles\nDaddy Fat Sax, B-I-G B-O-I\nIt's that same motherfucka that took them knuckles to your eye\nAnd I try, to warn you not to test but you don't listen\nGiving the shout-out to my Uncle Darnell locked up in prison\n\n[Hook]\nNow throw your hands in the air\nAnd wave 'em like you just don't care\nAnd if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit\nEverybody let me hear you say, \"O-Yea-yer\"\nNow throw your hands in the air\nAnd wave 'em like you just don't care\nAnd if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit\nEverybody let me hear you say, \"O-Yea-yer\"\n\n[Verse 2: Andre 3000]\nNow, my oral illustration be like clitoral stimulation\nTo the female gender, ain't nothing better\nLet me know when it's wet enough to enter\nIf not I'll wait, because the future of the world depends on\nIf or if not the child we raise gon' have that nigga syndrome\nOr will it know to beat the odds regardless of the skin tone?\nOr will it feel that if we tune it, it just might get picked on?\nOr will it give a fuck about what others say and get gone?\nThey alienate-us cause we different keep your hands to the sky\nLike Sounds of Blackness when I practice what I preach ain't no lie\nI'll be the baker and the maker of the piece of my pie\nNow breaker, breaker 10-4 can I get some reply?\nNow everybody say\n\n[Hook]\nNow throw your hands in the air\nAnd wave 'em like you just don't care\nAnd if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit\nEverybody let me hear you say, \"O-Yea-yer\"\nNow throw your hands in the air\nAnd wave 'em like you just don't care\nAnd if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit\nEverybody let me hear you say, \"O-Yea-yer\"\n\n[Verse 3: Big Boi]\nEvery day I sit while my nigga be in school\nThinking about the second album at the Dungeon shooting pool\nLike E-S to the P-N, cause we adjust to the beat in the zone (zone)\nHoney, I'm home but I'm not married\nCarried a lot of problems around being frustrated\nAnd now I'm sitting at the end of the month I just made it\nLike you made the B team, and like your daddy's wife you making that coffee\nYou heard the ATLiens, so back the hell up off me\n\n[Verse 4: Andre 3000]\nSoftly as if I played piano in the dark\nFound a way to channel my anger now to embark\nThe world's a stage and everybody's got to play their part\nGod works in mysterious ways so when he starts\nThe job of speaking through us we be so sincere with this here\nNo drugs or alcohol so I can get the signal clear as day\nPut my Glock away I got a stronger weapon\nThat never runs out of ammunition so I'm ready for war okay\n\n[Hook]\nNow throw your hands in the air\nAnd wave 'em like you just don't care\nAnd if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit\nEverybody let me hear you say, \"O-Yea-yer\"\nNow throw your hands in the air\nAnd wave 'em like you just don't care\nAnd if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit\nEverybody let me hear you say, \"O-Yea-yer\""}}, {"title": "So Fresh, So Clean", "album": "Stankonia", "year": "2001-03-13", "lyrics": "[Produced by Organized Noize]\n\n[Hook]\nAin't nobody dope as me; I'm just so fresh, so

I was vibing on reggae stuff at the time, listening to a lot of Bob Marley.\n\nIceberg Slim used to put out albums talking on beats and I was like, \u201cThis is cool.\u201d I think I laid down my verse first and Big just came in. But instead of spoken word, Big likes to call it \u201csmokin' word.\u201d That was his smokin' word.\n\n\nAndr\u00e9 also revealed that another artist was potentially going to be on this song:\n\nWe were riding in the car and Erykah [Badu] was originally supposed to be on \u201cSpottieOttie\u201d and somehow it ended up working out where she fit better on [\u201cLIberation\u201d].

horn-filled jam inspired by Reggae vibes and Good Times. Andr\u00e9 gave some background on the track:\n\n\nThe song started with a sample I\u2019d chopped up. I was vibing on reggae stuff at the time, listening to a lot of Bob Marley.\n\nIceberg Slim used to put out albums talking on beats and I was like, \u201cThis is cool.\u201d I think I laid down my verse first and Big just came in. But instead of spoken word, Big likes to call it \u201csmokin' word.\u201d That was his smokin' word.\n\n\nAndr\u00e9 also revealed that another artist was potentially going to be on this song:\n\nWe were riding in the car and Erykah [Badu] was originally supposed to be on \u201cSpottieOttie\u201d and somehow it ended up working out where she fit better on [\u201cLIberation\u201d]. So she went off and wrote her thing and ended up coming back with something cool."}, "comment_count": 2, "community": true, "custom_preview": null, "has_voters": true, "id": 3496866, "pinned": false,

James\nDamn, damn, damn, James\nDamn, damn, damn, James\nDamn, damn, damn, James\n\n[Verse 1: Sleepy Brown]\nDickie shorts, Lincoln's clean\nLeanin', checking out the scene\nGangsta boys, Bigga's lit\nRidin' out, talkin' shit\nNigga, where you wanna go?\nYou know the club don't close 'til four\nLet's party 'til we can't no more\nWatch out here come the folk, \"Damn\"\nOh, Lord\n\n[Verse 2: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nAs the plot thickens\nIt gives me the dickens, reminiscent of Charles\nA lil' discotheque nestled in the ghettos of Niggaville, USA\nVia Atlanta, Georgia\nA lil' spot where young men and young women go to experience they first littlel taste of the night life\nMe? Well, I've never been there\nWell, perhaps, once, but I was so engulfed in the Olde E, I never made it to the door\nYou speak of hardcore\nWhile the DJ sweatin' out all the problems and troubles of the day\nWhile this fine bow-legged girl fine as all outdoors\nLulls lukewarm lullabies in your left ear\nCompeting with \"Set it Off,\" in the right\nBut it all blends perfectly, if you let the liquor tell it\n\"Hey hey look baby they playin' our song\"\nAnd the crowd goes wild as if Holyfield has just won the fight\nBut in actuality it's only about 3 A.M\nAnd three niggas just don' got hauled\nOff in the ambulance, sliced up\nTwo niggas don' start bustin', \"wham! wham!\"\nAnd one nigga done took his shirt off, talkin' 'bout\n\"Now who else wanna fuck with Hollywood Court?\"\nIt's just my interpretation of the situation\n\n[Hook: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nDamn, damn, damn, James\nDamn, damn, damn, James\nDamn, damn, damn, James\nDamn, damn, damn, James\n\n[Verse 3: Big Boi]\nYes, when I first met my SpottieOttieDopalicious Angel\nI can remember that damn thing like yesterday\nThe way she moved reminded me of a Brown Stallion\nHorse with skates on, ya know\nSmooth like a hot comb on nappy ass hair\nI walked up on her and was almost paralyzed\nHer neck was smelling sweeter\nThan a plate of yams with extra syrup\nEyes beaming like four karats apiece just blindin' a nigga\nFelt like I chiefed a whole O of that Presidential\nMy heart was beating so damn fast\nNever knowing this moment would bring another\nLife into this world\nFunny how shit come together sometimes (ya dig)\nOne moment you frequent the booty clubs and\nThe next four years you & somebody's daughter\nRaisin' y'all own young'n now that's a beautiful thang\nThat's if you're on top of your game\nAnd man enough to handle real life situations (that is)\nCan't gamble feeding baby on that dope money\nMight not always be sufficient but the\nUnited Parcel Service & the people at the Post Office\nDidn't call you back because you had cloudy piss\nSo now you back in the trap just that, trapped\nGo on and marinate on that for a minute\n\n[Outro: Andr\u00e9 3000, Andrea Nivet + Delvida]\nDa, da, da, Ja, Ja, Ja\nDa,

This incident is said to be one of the catalysts of the Civil Right Movement in America in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nRosa Parks' legal team filed a lawsuit against OutKast and LaFace Records in a court case later known as Rosa Parks vs LaFace Records, but ultimately lost the case. Years later in 2005, the year Parks passed away, her family addressed the controversial lawsuit:\n\nI know, dementia or not, my Auntie would never, ever go to this length to hurt some young artists trying to make it in the world \u2026 As a family, our fear is that during her last days Auntie Rosa will be surrounded by strangers trying to make money off of her name.\n\nAndr\u00e9 provided some insight into the creation of the song:\n\nI actually submitted that beat to [Puff Daddy\u2019s old group] Total \u2013 \u2018cause I was going with Keisha from Total around that time \u2013 but they couldn\u2019t use it, so we ended up using it.\n\nBig Boi added:\n\nI took the beat home and I remember I was in my bedroom, and I was like, \u2018I got the hook!\u2019 I was playing the music loud as hell and I was just singing the hook: \u2018Aah-haah, hush that fuss!\u2019 Like, that\u2019s it, we need to lay it down."}, "embed_content": "<div id='rg_embed_link_451' class='rg_embed_link'

Parks\u201d may not have been the duo\u2019s most successful single, but it established OutKast\u2019s legitimacy as pioneers of Southern hip-hop.\n\nOn 1 December 1955 in Montgomery, Alabama, Rosa Parks refused to obey bus driver James Blake\u2019s order to give up her seat in the colored section to a white passenger. This incident is said to be one of the catalysts of the Civil Right Movement in America in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nRosa Parks' legal team filed a lawsuit against OutKast and LaFace Records in a court case later known as Rosa Parks vs LaFace Records, but ultimately lost the case. Years later in 2005, the year Parks passed away, her family addressed the controversial lawsuit:\n\nI know, dementia or not, my Auntie would never, ever go to this length to hurt some young artists trying to make it in the world \u2026 As a family, our fear is that during her last days Auntie Rosa will be surrounded by strangers trying to make money off of her name.\n\nAndr\u00e9 provided some insight into the creation of the song:\n\nI actually submitted that beat to [Puff Daddy\u2019s old group] Total \u2013 \u2018cause I was going with Keisha from Total around that time \u2013 but they couldn\u2019t use it, so we ended up using it.\n\nBig Boi added:\n\nI took the beat home and I remember I was in my bedroom, and I was like, \u2018I got the hook!\u2019 I was playing the music loud as hell and I was just singing the hook: \u2018Aah-haah, hush that fuss!\u2019 Like, that\u2019s it, we need to lay it down."}, "comment_count": 0, "community": true, "custom_preview": null,

lacka-lacka-lacka\nUh-huh, baby, uh-huh, yeah, yeah\nUh-cracka, lacka-lacka-lacka, cracka, lacka-lacka-lacka\nBaby, yeah, yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh\n\n[Hook: Big Boi]\nAh ha, hush that fuss\nEverybody move to the back of the bus\nDo you wanna bump and slump with us?\nWe the type of people make the club get crunk\nAh ha, hush that fuss\nEverybody move to the back of the bus\nDo you wanna bump and slump with us?\nWe the type of people make the club get crunk\n\n[Verse 1: Big Boi]\nMany a day has passed, the night has gone by\nBut still I find the time to put that bump off in your eye\nTotal chaos, for these playas, thought we was absent\nWe takin' another route to represent the Dungeon Family\nLike Great Day, me and my nigga decide to take the back way\nWe stabbin' every city then we headed to that Bat cave\nATL, Georgia, what do we do for ya?\nBulldoggin' hoes like them Georgetown Hoyas\nBoy, you sounding silly, think my Brougham ain't sittin' pretty\nDoing doughnuts 'round you suckas like them circles around titties\nDamn, we, the committee, gon' burn it down\nBut us gon' bust you in the mouth with the chorus now, say\n\n[Hook: Big Boi]\nAh ha, hush that fuss\nEverybody move to the back of the bus\nDo you wanna bump and slump with us?\nWe the type of people make the club get crunk\nSay, ah ha, hush that fuss\nEverybody move to the back of the bus\nDo you wanna bump and slump with us?\nWe the type of people make the club get crunk\n\n[Verse 2: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nI met a gypsy and she hipped me to some life game\nTo stimulate then activate the left and right brain\nSaid, \"Baby boy, you only funky as your last cut\nYou focus on the past, your ass'll be a 'has-what'\"\nThat's one to live by or either that's one to die to\nI try to just throw it at you, determine your own adventure\nAndr\u00e9, got to her station, here's my destination\nShe got off the bus, the conversation lingered in my head for hours\nTook a shower, kinda sour 'cause my favorite group ain't comin' with it\nBut I'm witchya 'cause you probably goin' through it anyway\nBut anyhow, when in doubt, went on out and bought it\n'Cause I thought it would be jammin' but examine all the flawsky-wawsky\nAwfully sad and it's costly, but that's all she wrote\nAnd I hope I never have to float in that boat\nUp shit's creek, \"It's weak\" is the last quote\nThat I want to hear when I'm goin' down when all's said and done\nAnd we got a new joe in town\nWhen the record player get to skippin' and slowin' down\nAll y'all can say is, \"Them niggas earned that crown\", but until then\n\n[Hook: Big Boi]\nAh ha, hush that fuss\nEverybody move to the back of the bus\nDo you wanna bump and slump with us?\nWe the type of people make the club get crunk\nSay ah ha, hush that fuss\nEverybody move to the back of the bus\nDo you wanna bump and slump with us?\nWe the type of people make the club get crunk\n\n[Harmonica Solo: Pastor Robert Hodo]\n\n[Hook: Big Boi]\nAh ha, hush that fuss\nEverybody move to the back of the bus\nDo you wanna bump and slump with us?\nWe the type of people make the club get crunk\nSay ah ha, hush that fuss\nEverybody move to the back of the bus\nDo you wanna bump and slump with us?\nWe the type of people make the club get crunk\n\n[Outro: Debra Killings (& Big Boi)]\nUh-huh, uh-huh, baby, yeah, yeah\nUh-huh, yeah, yeah, baby,

of years ago on Headland and Delowe\nWas the start of something good\nWhere me and my nigga rode the MARTA through the hood\nJust tryna find that hook up\nNow everyday we looked up at the ceiling\nWatching ceiling fans go 'round, tryna catch that feeling\nOff instrumentals, had my pencil and plus my paper\nWe caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur\nWriting rhymes, tryna find our spot off in that light\nLight off in that spot, knowing that we could rock\nDoing the hole in the wall clubs, this shit here must stop\nLike \"Freeze!\" We making the crowd move\nBut we not making no G's and that's a no-no\n\n[Verse 2: Big Boi]\nCheck it, a one-two, a one-two dope niggas in the Cadillac\nThey call us, went from Player's Ball to ballers\nPutting the South up on the map was like Little Rock to banging\nNiggas say mothafuck that playin, they payin, we stayin, layin vocals\nLocales done made it with them big boys up in this industry\n\"OutKast, yeah, them niggas, they making big noise\"\nOver a million sold to this day, niggas they take it lightly\n'96 gon' be that year that all y'all playa haters can bite me\nI'm out this bitch\n\n[Hook]\nMe and you\nYour momma and your cousin too\nRolling down the strip on Vogues\nComing up, slamming Cadillac doors\nMe and you\nYour momma and your cousin too\nRolling down the strip on Vogues\nComing up, slamming Cadillac doors\n\n[Verse 3: Big Boi]\nBack in the day, when I was younger, hunger\nLooking to fill me belly with that Rally's bullshit\nPull shit off, like it was supposed to be pulled\nFull as a tick, I was stoned like them white boys\nSmoking them White Golds before them blunts got crunk\nChunky asses, passes getting thrown like Hail Mary's\nAnd they looking like Halle Berry's\nSo so fine, intertwined, but we ain't sipping wine\nWe's just chilling, I'm the rabid villain, and I'm so high\nSmoking freely, me, Lil B, Reek, Mone and Shug\nAnd my little brother James, thangs changed in the hood\nWhere I live at, them rats know, \"Momma I want to sing\nBut momma I want to trick, and momma I'm sucking dick now\"\nWe moving on up in the world like elevators\nMe and the crew, we pimps like '82\nMe and you like Tony Toni Tone\nLike this, East Point and we gone\n\n[Hook]\nMe and you\nYour momma and your cousin too\nRolling down the strip on Vogues\nComing up, slamming Cadillac doors\nMe and you\nYour momma and your cousin too\nRolling down the strip on Vogues\nComing up, slamming Cadillac doors\n\n[Verse 4: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nGot stopped at the mall the other day\nHeard a call from the other way that I just came from\nSome nigga was saying something, talking 'bout smoke something \"Hey man, you remember me from school?\" \"No not really\"\nBut he kept smiling like a clown, facial expression looking silly\nAnd he kept asking me, \"What kinda car you drive?\nI know you paid, I know y'all got beaucoup of hoes\nFrom all them songs that y'all done made\"\nAnd I replied that I had been going through the same things that he had\nTrue, I've got more fans than the average man\nBut not enough loot to last me to the end of the week\nI live by the beat like you live check-to-check\nIf it don't move your feet then I don't eat so we like neck-to-neck\nYes, we done come a long way like them slim-ass cigarettes\nFrom Virginia, this ain't gon' stop, so we just gon' continue\n\n[Hook]\nMe and you\nYour momma and your cousin too\nRolling down the strip on Vogues\nComing up, slamming Cadillac doors\nMe and you\nYour momma and your cousin too\nRolling down the strip on Vogues\nComing up, slamming Cadillac doors\nMe and you\nYour momma and your cousin too\nRolling down the strip on Vogues\nComing up, slamming Cadillac doors\nMe and you\nYour momma and your cousin too\nRolling down the strip on Vogues\nComing up, slamming Cadillac doors\nMe and you"}}, {"title": "Da Art of Storytellin' (Pt. 1)", "album": "Aquemini", "year": "1999-05-25", "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Big Boi]\nSomebody hit me the other day for a rendezvous\nWas it the bitch that fucked the Goodie, and the Dungeon Crew?\nLet's say her name was Suzy Skrew\u2014'cause she screwed a lot\nMaking a nigga hit that chonk at legitimate spots\nNot no parks, backseats, or things of that nature\nHad to hate ya player, I'm dickin the ho down, never said I paid her\nStraight laid her, slayed the bitch like Darth Vader, made her\nFrom College Park and Fayette all the way down to Decatur\nLike Jada, her wig was sharp and sporty, that was shorty\nSafe as a snake on eggs in a Beamer 840\nIt's foggy, I went to the crib to call her but she lost me\nMy baby mamma beeped seven o'clock it's gonna cost me\nBut I still wanna cut her though, maybe she had to work\nI caught her in the mall, wearing a real tight skirt\nShe was fine as fuck; I wanted to sex the ho up\nShe said, \"Let's hit the parking lot so I can sick your duck\"\nI said, \"Cool, I really wanted to cut you but this'll do\nI gotta pick up my daughter plus my baby mama beeped me too\"\nShe said she understood and everything was kosher\nI gave her a Lil' Will CD, and a fuckin poster, it's like that now\n\n[Hook: Sleepy Brown + Big Boi]\nIt's like that now, you better go on\nAnd get the hump up out your back now\nIt's about four or five cats off in my 'Lac now\nWe just shoot game in the form of story raps now\nIt's like that now, it's like that now\n\n[Verse 2: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nNow Suzy Skrew had a partner named Sasha Thumper\nI remember her number like the summer\nWhen her and Suzy yeah they threw a slumber\nParty, but you can not call it that cause it was slummer\nWell, it was more like spend the night\nThree in the morning yawning, dancing under street lights\nWe chilling like a villain and a nigga feeling right\nIn the middle of the ghetto on the curb, but in spite\nAll of the bullshit we on our back staring at the stars above\nTalking bout what we gonna be when we grow up\nI said, \"What you wanna be?\" She said, \"Alive\"\nIt made me think for a minute, then looked in her eyes\nI coulda died, time went on, I got grown\nRhyme got strong, mind got blown\nI came back home, to find lil' Sasha was gone\nHer mamma said she with a nigga that be treating her wrong\nI kept on singing my song and hoping at a show\nThat I would one day see her standing in the front row\nBut two weeks later she got found in the back of a school\nWith a needle in her arm, baby two months due\nSasha Thumper\n\n[Hook: Sleepy Brown + Big Boi]\nIt's like that now, you better go on\nAnd get the hump up out your back now\nIt's about four or

Andr\u00e9 gave some insight into his verse:\n\n\nEvery story that I\u2019ve ever told is either triggered by something that I\u2019ve been through or something that someone I know has experienced. So a lot of times, it\u2019s based on something real.\n\nWhen me and Erykah [Badu] were still together, one of Erykah\u2019s friends in Dallas had a young daughter who was real intelligent. She was in school one day and the teacher asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up, and the answer she gave was, \u201calive.\u201d I always thought that was so cool so I wove it into the story I was telling.\n\n\nThe song was remixed and released as a single with a verse from Slick Rick telling his own story of a crazy relationship. The single peaked at #67 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.\n\nThe addictive beat was introduced to a new audience in 2013 when J.

promiscuous woman he encountered and Andre telling a tragic tale about a girl from his past. Andr\u00e9 gave some insight into his verse:\n\n\nEvery story that I\u2019ve ever told is either triggered by something that I\u2019ve been through or something that someone I know has experienced. So a lot of times, it\u2019s based on something real.\n\nWhen me and Erykah [Badu] were still together, one of Erykah\u2019s friends in Dallas had a young daughter who was real intelligent. She was in school one day and the teacher asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up, and the answer she gave was, \u201calive.\u201d I always thought that was so cool so I wove it into the story I was telling.\n\n\nThe song was remixed and released as a single with a verse from Slick Rick telling his own story of a crazy relationship. The single peaked at #67 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.\n\nThe addictive beat was introduced to a new audience in 2013 when J. Cole used it for his song \u201cLAnd Of The Snakes\u201d."}, "comment_count": 0, "community": true, "custom_preview": null, "has_voters": true, "id": 3494244, "pinned": false, "share_url":

it the bitch that fucked the Goodie, and the Dungeon Crew?\nLet's say her name was Suzy Skrew\u2014'cause she screwed a lot\nMaking a nigga hit that chonk at legitimate spots\nNot no parks, backseats, or things of that nature\nHad to hate ya player, I'm dickin the ho down, never said I paid her\nStraight laid her, slayed the bitch like Darth Vader, made her\nFrom College Park and Fayette all the way down to Decatur\nLike Jada, her wig was sharp and sporty, that was shorty\nSafe as a snake on eggs in a Beamer 840\nIt's foggy, I went to the crib to call her but she lost me\nMy baby mamma beeped seven o'clock it's gonna cost me\nBut I still wanna cut her though, maybe she had to work\nI caught her in the mall, wearing a real tight skirt\nShe was fine as fuck; I wanted to sex the ho up\nShe said, \"Let's hit the parking lot so I can sick your duck\"\nI said, \"Cool, I really wanted to cut you but this'll do\nI gotta pick up my daughter plus my baby mama beeped me too\"\nShe said she understood and everything was kosher\nI gave her a Lil' Will CD, and a fuckin poster, it's like that now\n\n[Hook: Sleepy Brown + Big Boi]\nIt's like that now, you better go on\nAnd get the hump up out your back now\nIt's about four or five cats off in my 'Lac now\nWe just shoot game in the form of story raps now\nIt's like that now, it's like that now\n\n[Verse 2: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nNow Suzy Skrew had a partner named Sasha Thumper\nI remember her number like the summer\nWhen her and Suzy yeah they threw a slumber\nParty, but you can not call it that cause it was slummer\nWell, it was more like spend the night\nThree in the morning yawning, dancing under street lights\nWe chilling like a villain and a nigga feeling right\nIn the middle of the ghetto on the curb, but in spite\nAll of the bullshit we on our back staring at the stars above\nTalking bout what we gonna be when we grow up\nI said, \"What you wanna be?\" She said, \"Alive\"\nIt made me think for a minute, then looked in her eyes\nI coulda died, time went on, I got grown\nRhyme got strong, mind got blown\nI came back home, to find lil' Sasha was gone\nHer mamma said she with a nigga that be treating her wrong\nI kept on singing my song and hoping at a show\nThat I would one day see her standing in the front row\nBut two weeks later she got found in the back of a school\nWith a needle in her arm, baby two months due\nSasha Thumper\n\n[Hook: Sleepy Brown + Big Boi]\nIt's like that now, you better go on\nAnd get the hump up out your back now\nIt's about four or five cats off in my 'Lac now\nWe just shoot game in the form of story rap now\nIt's like that now, it's like that now\n\n[Outro]\nGrandmama \u2013 Keisha, Keisha! Cut that loud mess off, you hear all that thunderin' and lightnin', and get off that telephone!\nKeisha \u2013 Uh, Alright\nChildren \u2013 Grandmama, what\u2019s all that noise? (I\u2019m scared)\nGrandmama \u2013 Baby don\u2019t be scared, it\u2019s gonna be alright.

Producer Rico Wade claimed this song was \u201cwhen Big and Dre were coming into their own.\u201d\n\nAndr\u00e9 3000 was a heavy subject in this track and he provided some insight into his verse:\n\n\nI was young and wilder and some of my fashion choices people didn\u2019t accept at the time. I started getting flak from some people, so they were like, \u2018Either he\u2019s gay or on drugs.\u2019 And it\u2019s funny because I was high as hell all the way through Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, but by ATLiens and Aquemini I wasn\u2019t smoking or drinking.\n\nWith Big Boi standing by me I knew I had to address some of the shit \u2018cause I can\u2019t have my homeboy looking bad. I knew a lotta people felt like Southernplayalistic was some of our hardest work and they felt like we strayed from that. So 'Return of the Gangsta\u2019 was trying to give them a sense of, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m still a regular person.\u2019\n\nAt the end of the day, you\u2019ve still got to go through the same neighborhoods so sometimes you have to say stuff to let people know what it is. I\u2019m a man so you can\u2019t say some of this stuff to me. The things in that verse were addressing all of that.\n\n\nBig Boi added:\n\nBack then, there was a whole bunch of shit talking. People just couldn\u2019t understand how we were making the type of music we were making. There were a lot of attacks coming at my partner, so we wanted OutKast to be like, \u2018You fuck with my homeboy, we gonna fuck you up.\u2019 We wanted to let people know, this man doesn\u2019t stand by himself.

Producer Rico Wade claimed this song was \u201cwhen Big and Dre were coming into their own.\u201d\n\nAndr\u00e9 3000 was a heavy subject in this track and he provided some insight into his verse:\n\n\nI was young and wilder and some of my fashion choices people didn\u2019t accept at the time. I started getting flak from some people, so they were like, \u2018Either he\u2019s gay or on drugs.\u2019 And it\u2019s funny because I was high as hell all the way through Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, but by ATLiens and Aquemini I wasn\u2019t smoking or drinking.\n\nWith Big Boi standing by me I knew I had to address some of the shit \u2018cause I can\u2019t have my homeboy looking bad. I knew a lotta people felt like Southernplayalistic was some of our hardest work and they felt like we strayed from that. So 'Return of the Gangsta\u2019 was trying to give them a sense of, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m still a regular person.\u2019\n\nAt the end of the day, you\u2019ve still got to go through the same neighborhoods so sometimes you have to say stuff to let people know what it is. I\u2019m a man so you can\u2019t say some of this stuff to me. The things in that verse were addressing all of that.\n\n\nBig Boi added:\n\nBack then, there was a whole bunch of shit talking. People just couldn\u2019t understand how we were making the type of music we were making. There were a lot of attacks coming at my partner, so we wanted OutKast to be like, \u2018You fuck with my homeboy, we gonna fuck you up.\u2019 We wanted to let people know, this man doesn\u2019t stand by himself. I mean, that\u2019s my dog.

right, workin' street corner in the midnight\nPicture the scene, these fiends with fire\nTen dollar dreams, scheme, for a sack of that, believe that\nI'm wit' whateva like Wheatstraw\nStuck servin' my cocaine raw\nDrop sixty-two off the brick, jump back\nTwenty over, now that's mo' money to get\nSlick, we fin' to lick on this corner without gettin' caught\nBut time, keep a sleepin' and money gettin' short\nPlus that crooked cop Brock think we blow slangin' (fuck him)\nThat why he ride through the hole with the do' swangin'\nBut I make moves, shake them tricks up out they shoestrings\nBe more precise when we do things\n'Cause life is like shakin' the dice, but I buck back twice\nLike five-deuce, fo'-trey, okay\n\n[Hook]\nI'm strictly stressin' dirty dirty\nGon' represent it to the T-top\nBorn and bred up on the street top\nGet to the money and the sweet spot\nAnd forever hollerin' \"Hootie Hoo!\" when we see cops\nI'm strictly stressin' dirty dirty\nGon' represent it to the T-top\nBorn and bred up on the street top\nGet to the money and the sweet spot\nAnd forever hollerin' \"Hootie Hoo!\" when we see cops\n\n[Verse 2: Big Boi]\nShit, cops and robbers, niggas be bound to get them dollars and cents\nThey get in a slump like baseball players when they short on they rent\nAnything goin', you ain't knowin' how much money you spent\nBut in the real world you surrounded by these ladies and gents\nWho hang around you 'cause you be buyin' all the weed and all the chicken\nFeedin' everybody, smokin' 'em out\nWhen you was broke though they was missin'\nNow you ridin' 'bout fo' deep, startin' to tear up your suspension\nAnd your baby mamma on child support, my fault, forget to mention\nYou don't even have a checking account wasn't thinking about no pension\nI used to work at Steak 'N' Ale, Old Gold off in the kitchen\nHad determination and graduated, now I got the whole rap world fascinated\nI wanted a piece of the pie for me and my family so I made it\nContinue to sell dope, it's payin' the bills so you gon' do it\nBut legislation got this new policy: three strikes and you're ruined\nNow where your crew at? Yeah\n\n[Hook]\nI'm strictly stressin' dirty dirty\nGon' represent it to the T-top\nBorn and bred up on the street top\nGet to the money and the sweet spot\nAnd forever hollerin' \"Hootie Hoo!\" when we see cops\nI'm strictly stressin' dirty dirty\nGon' represent it to the T-top\nBorn and bred up on the street top\nGet to the money and the sweet spot\nAnd forever hollerin' \"Hootie Hoo!\" when we see cops\n\n[Verse 3: Cool Breeze]\nAy, me and my buddy on the cut and they know we servin' 'em slabs\nWe better watch what we doing, and look out for Joe Nab\nAnd quit re-ing up and standing on this same old block\nBefore our gangsta-ass partner get both of us shot\nNiggas talkin' 'cause they making some flow\nBut still ain't did nothin' that ain't been done befo'\nYou can't be trying to showcase, just put it down for your spot\nAnd improvise and work with that little you got\nSo I think when I finish selling my last sack\nI'ma take some of this money, go and give some back\n'Cause people won't forget about the time you gave, knowmsayin'?\nAnd start thinkin' 'bout a path to pave\n\n[Hook]\nI'm strictly stressin' dirty dirty\nGon' represent it to the T-top\nBorn and bred up on the street top\nGet to the money and the sweet spot\nAnd forever hollerin' \"Hootie Hoo!\" when we see cops\nI'm strictly stressin' dirty dirty\nGon' represent it to the T-top\nBorn and bred up on the street top\nGet to the money and the sweet spot\nAnd forever hollerin' \"Hootie Hoo!\" when we see cops\n\n[Outro: Big Boi]\nThis is uh\u2026 a lil'\u2026 tune that we composed back on the first album\nI know a lot of y'all, uh, playas out there thought we wasn't gon' come back at y'all with this thang here, but\u2026 it go a lil' some' like this!"}}, {"title": "Jazzy Belle", "album": "ATLiens", "year": "1996-08-27", "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Andre 3000]\nOh yes I love her like Egyptian\nWant a description?

'em\nWith these old ghetto poems, thinking it's better for 'em\nWhen they can let they thumb down from hitchhiking\nInviting niggas into the temple they call their body\nNow everybody got it, had it, alked about it amongst they friends\nComing around my crew looking Jazzy, wanna pretend\nLike you Ms. Goody Four-Shoes, even Bo knew that you got poked\nLike acupuncture patients\nWhile our nation is a boat, straight sinking\nI hate thinking that these the future mommas of our chill'un\nThey fucking a different nigga every time they get the feeling to\nI\u2019m willing to go the extra kilo-meter\nJust to see my se\u00f1orita get her pillow\nOn the side of my bed where no girl ever stay\nHouse and doctor was the games we used to play\nBut now it\u2019s real Jazzy Belle\n\n[Verse 2: Big Boi]\nSee what if you was a playa, real playa not no flaw\nHaving the very best of life: lobster, steak and Perignon\nSmoking an ounce of weed\nAnd every single day was personal FreakNik\nTricking these hoes in Polo clothes, life as you conceived it\nBut your conception, deception, looking into your eyes\nI see your weapon and it\u2019s depressing\nThey're digging up in your thighs, leaving deposits\nKeeping your closets open, knocking your boots and drawers\nHoping to get you sprung like bail-bonds\nSteadily calling me Antwan 'cause you thinking that you my lady\nBitch don\u2019t play me 'cause you\u2019re janky\nI wanted to hit that ass but me and the Goodie we got danky\nSo thank thee, for running that Southerplayalistic game\nYou was the only one to blame, anigga don\u2019t even know yo name\nIt\u2019s a shame, you cracking 'em up and fucking a nigga like 2Pac up\nI\u2019m leaving these foes to be the flowers and wake don\u2019t get me\nSee, I gotta be feeding my daughter\nTeach her to be that Natural Woman\n'Cause you\u2019ll be Waiting to Exhale while you other hoes be Dumb\nAnd Dumber, yeah, you know what I\u2019m saying\n\n[Verse 3: Andre 3000]\nSee me and ol' girl in the black-on-black 'Lac Northstar\nWindows are tinted so that no one knows who us are\nTalk bad about her nigga guaranteed to snap like bra\nStraps, sticking together like grandma and grandpa-pa\nIn this dog-eat-dog world\nKitty cats be scratching on my furry coat to curl\nUp with me and my bowl of kibbles and bits\nI want to earl, 'cause most of the girls\nThat we was liking in high school, now they dyking\n\n[Verse 4: Big Boi]\nHaving no mercy for the disrespectful ones, some\nBe hanging around the crew looking for funds, dumb\nDeaf and fine, they be asking me all about mine\nHow she doing how she be, I know she\u2019s sipping that wine\nBehind my back they squawk like vultures\nOff and On like Trends of Cultures baby\nHey he, faking it like these sculptured nails\nBut they can go to hell and lay with Lucifer\n'Cause they burning anyway, Big Boi use her and abuse her\n\n[Outro: Khujo Goodie]\nTricks hollin' they got rank\nTricks hollin' they got rank\nTricks hollin' they got rank\nTricks hollin' they got rank\nTricks hollin' they got rank\nTricks hollin' they got rank\nTricks hollin' they got rank\nTricks hollin' they got rank", "image":

side of your face\nWe tapping right into your memory banks - thanks!\nSo click it or ticket, let's see your seat belt fastened\nTrunk rattling, like two midgets in the backseat rassling\nSpeakerboxxx vibrate the tag\nMake it sound like aluminum cans in a bag\nBut I know y'all wanted that 808\nCan you feel that B-A-S-S bass?\nBut I know y'all wanted that 808\nCan you feel that B-A-S-S bass?\n\n[Hook: Sleepy Brown]\nI like the way you move\nI like the way you move wooo\nI love the way you move\nI love the way, I love the way\nI like the way you move\nI like the way you move wooo\nI

was looking at them, there there on the dancefloor\nNow they got me in the middle, feeling like a man-whore\nEspecially the big girl\nBig girls need love too, no discrimination here squirrel\nSo keep your hands off my cheeks\nLet me study how you ride the beat, you big freak\nSkinny slim women got the cameltoe within them\nYou can hump them, lift them, bend them, give them\nSomething to remember, yell out\nTimber when you fall through the chop shop\nTake a deep breath and exhale\nYour ex-male friend boyfriend's boring as hell\nBut let me listen to the story you tell\nAnd we can make moves like a person in jail, on the low ho\n\n[Hook: Sleepy Brown]\nI like the way you move\nI like the way you move wooo\nI love the way you move\nI love the way, I love the way\nI like the way you move\nI like

so fine) look so fine\nYou driving me out my mind (out of my mind)\nOut my mind, ooooh baby\nIf I could I would just be with you baby\nOooh cause you light me, and excite me\nAnd you know, you got me

you were on the talcum\nPowder\u2014how's about them oranges?\nMoved away from home to school with big plans\nBy day, studied the history of music\nBy night, just to pay for that shit, you'd dance\nTo get your pants was a Mission Impo\u2013ssible\nWe were both the same age, but I\nSuppose wasn't on the same page, but in\nThe same book of life, so I'd page you when\nI felt you that were getting off of work\nOr either when you're on your way to school\nWe started hanging like Ernie and Bert\nAnd in my idle head I'm thinking, \"Cool\"\nJust when I think I'm going down your shirt\nYou're hiking up your skirt now\nThe events that followed had me volley\nIf your hometown would be heaven or hell\nThe angelic nastiness you possessed made you by far the best\nTherefore hard to tell\nYou'd dropped me off by the Dungeon\nNever came in, but I knew that you were wondering\n\"Now are these niggas in this house up to something\nSelling crack sack by sacks so they could function?\"\nW-W-W-Well, yes and no\nYes, we were selling it, but no, it wasn't blow\nCook it in the basement then move it at a show\nThen grab the microphone and everybody yelled, \"Ho!\"\nMeanwhile, the video starts playing\nBET, college radio, and a van\nPacked full of niggas with a blunt in their hand\nAnd one in their ear, you know what I'm saying\nBut, I kept your number in my old phone\nGot a new chip flip with the roam-roam\nSo it took me a minute to retrieve seven digits\nBut I promised I would call you when I got home\nBut, when I got home, I never did\nBy the time I did, heard that you had a kid\nBy some nigga in Decatur who replied, \"See you later\"\nWhen he got the good news; that's life, shit\nNow, I'm nineteen with a Cadillac\nMy nigga had a Lex with the gold pack\nGot a plaque, but I'm living with my pop-pop\nSo I got a Glock and a LoJack\nYou kinda fast for that fella in class who used to draw\nAnd never said much 'cause half of what he saw\nWas so far from that place you wanna be\nThat words only fucked it up more, follow me\nAre you starting to gather what I'm getting at?\nNow if I'm losing you, tell me, then I'll double back\nBut keep in mind, at the time \"keep it real\" was the phrase\nSilly once said now, but those were the days\nWhen Spring Break, and Daytona, and Freakniks\nMade you wanna drop out of college and never go back\nMove to the South, but that ain't a Kodak\nMoment, on went myself and Big Boi\nWell, you knew him as 'Twan\nThat's right, you were around before this shit begun\nWhen 'Twan had a daughter and\nSorta was made to mature before the first tour\nWe hit the road like Jack\nLaughed and cried and drive it back with some Yak\nGirls used to say, \"Y'all talk funny, y'all from the islands?\"\nAnd I'd laugh and they'd just keep smiling\n\"No, I'm from Atlanta, baby, he from Savannah, maybe\nWe should hook up and get tore up and then lay down, hey, we\nGotta go because the bus is pulling out in thirty minutes\"\nShe's playing tennis, disturbing the tenants\n15-love, fit like glove\nDescription is like fifteen doves\nIn a jacuzzi catching the Holy Ghost\nMaking one woozy in the head and comatose, agree?\nEnough about me, how's about you? How's the lil' kid?\nShe was about two the last time we spoke\nI hadn't smoked or took a shot of drink\n'Cause I'd start the second album off on another note\nNow, that note threw some niggas in the hood off\nBut see, I'd balled out, and 'fore I'd fall out\nI'd slow my Lac down to a nice speed\nThe brain was that fried egg I might need\nNew direction was apparent\nI was a child looking at the floor, staring\nSo changing my style was like relief for the primitive beast\nYes, I was on the rise, yeast was the street\nTo make bread, never primary concern\nJust to hop on these beats and wait my turn\nI'd meet Muslims, gangstas, bitches, rastas\nAnd macaroni niggas, imposters\nSo on a trip to New York on some beeswax\nI get invited to a club where emcees at\nAnd on stage is a singer with some thing on her head\nSimilar to the turban that I covered up my dreads with\nWhich I was rocking at the time\nWhen I was going through them phases trying to find\nAnything that seemed real in the world\nStill searching, but I started liking this girl\nNow you know her as Erykah \"On and On\" Badu\nCall Tyrone on the phone, \"Why you\nDo that girl like that, boy? You ought to be ashamed\"\nThe song wasn't about me and that ain't my name\nWe're young, in love, in short we had fun\nNo regrets, no abortion, had a son\nBy the name of Seven, and he's five\nBy the time I do this mix, he'll probably be six\nYou do the arithmetic, me do the language arts\nY'all stand against the wall blindfolded, we throw the darts\nTo poke you in the heart and take you from the start\nTo when luxury transportation meant a MARTA card\nOr either when your girlfriend that went to Mays\nMama or her daddy let her borrow the Benz, because she's smart\nOr maybe if your neighbor does you a huge favor\nAnd he sells you that Rabbit that's been sitting in his yard\nYou fix it up, you trick it out, you give it rims, you give it bump\nYou give it all your time because that's all you can think about\nAnd that's as far as I got\n(*music fades*)\n\n[Radio Interview]\nAnd that's as far as I got, and where I wanted to go\nKnowing the whole summer that's all you could think about\nEven though if you cut it off and start that bitch up\nYou need a jump, like your need and your want to grow\nAnd you change all the time\nSo that Rabbit that you thought about that whole summer\nThe next summer, you didn't want that Rabbit no more\nYou wanted something bigger and better\n\"So the summer passed and now the Rabbit's old?\"\nRight... right, so now you want a

were coming out with an album\nYou looked at me like, \"Yeah, nigga, right\"\nBut you gave me your number anyway, you were on the talcum\nPowder\u2014how's about them oranges?\nMoved away from home to school with big plans\nBy day, studied the history of music\nBy night, just to pay for that shit, you'd dance\nTo get your pants was a Mission Impo\u2013ssible\nWe were both the same age, but I\nSuppose wasn't on the same page, but in\nThe same book of life, so I'd page you when\nI felt you that were getting off of work\nOr either when you're on your way to school\nWe started hanging like Ernie and Bert\nAnd in my idle head I'm thinking, \"Cool\"\nJust when I think I'm going down your shirt\nYou're hiking up your skirt now\nThe events that followed had me volley\nIf your hometown would be heaven or hell\nThe angelic nastiness you possessed made you by far the best\nTherefore hard to tell\nYou'd dropped me off by the Dungeon\nNever came in, but I knew that you were wondering\n\"Now are these niggas in this house up to something\nSelling crack sack by sacks so they could function?\"\nW-W-W-Well, yes and no\nYes, we were selling it, but no, it wasn't blow\nCook it in the basement then move it at a show\nThen grab the microphone and everybody yelled, \"Ho!\"\nMeanwhile, the video starts playing\nBET, college radio, and a van\nPacked full of niggas with a blunt in their hand\nAnd one in their ear, you know what I'm saying\nBut, I kept your number in my old phone\nGot a new chip flip with the roam-roam\nSo it took me a minute to retrieve seven digits\nBut I promised I would call you when I got home\nBut, when I got home, I never did\nBy the time I did, heard that you had a kid\nBy some nigga in Decatur who replied, \"See you later\"\nWhen he got the good news; that's life, shit\nNow, I'm nineteen with a Cadillac\nMy nigga had a Lex with the gold pack\nGot a plaque, but I'm living with my pop-pop\nSo I got a Glock and a LoJack\nYou kinda fast for that fella in class who used to draw\nAnd never said much 'cause half of what he saw\nWas so far from that place you wanna be\nThat words only fucked it up more, follow me\nAre you starting to gather what I'm getting at?\nNow if I'm losing you, tell me, then I'll double back\nBut keep in mind, at the time \"keep it real\" was the phrase\nSilly once said now, but those were the days\nWhen Spring Break, and Daytona, and Freakniks\nMade you wanna drop out of college and never go back\nMove to the South, but that ain't a Kodak\nMoment, on went myself and Big Boi\nWell, you knew him as 'Twan\nThat's right, you were around before this shit begun\nWhen 'Twan had a daughter and\nSorta was made to mature before the first tour\nWe hit the road like Jack\nLaughed and cried and drive it back with some Yak\nGirls used to say, \"Y'all talk funny, y'all from the islands?\"\nAnd I'd laugh and they'd just keep smiling\n\"No, I'm from Atlanta, baby, he from Savannah, maybe\nWe should hook up and get tore up and then lay down, hey, we\nGotta go because the bus is pulling out in thirty minutes\"\nShe's playing tennis, disturbing the tenants\n15-love, fit like glove\nDescription is like fifteen doves\nIn

high\nYou need git up, git out and git something\nHow will you make it if you never even try?\nYou need to git up, git out and git something\nCause you and I got to do for you and I\n\n[Verse 1: Cee-Lo]\nI don't recall, ever graduating at all\nSometimes I feel I'm just a disappointment to y'all\nEvery day I just lay around then I can't be found\nAlways asking \"Gimme some,\" living life like a bum\nTimes is rough, my auntie got enough problems of her own\nNigga, you supposed to be grown\nI agree, I try to be the man I'm 'posed to be\nBut negativity is all you seem to ever see\nI admit, I've done some dumb shit, and I'm probably gon' do some mo'\nYou shouldn't hold that against me though\n(Why not?) Why not? My music's all that I got\nBut some time must be invested for this to be manifested\nI know you know but I'm gon' say this to you, I\nGet high but I don't get too high\nSo what's the limit 'posed to be?\nThat must be why you can't get yo ass up out the bed before three\nYou need to git up, git out, cut that bullshit out\nAin't you sick and tired of having to do without?\nDamn, what up with all these questions?\nYou act as though you know something I don't, do you have any suggestions?\nCause every job I get is cruel and demeaning\nSick of taking trash out and toilet bowl cleaning\nBut I'm also sick and tired of struggling\nI never ever thought I'd to have resort to drug smuggling\nNaw, that ain't what I'm about\nCee-Lo will just continue traveling his route\nWithout any doubt or fear\nI know the Lord ain't brought me this far so he could drop me off here\nDid I make myself clear?\n\n[Hook: Cee-Lo]\nYou need to git up, git out and git something\nDon't let the days of your life pass by\nYou need to git up, git out and git something\nDon't spend all your time tryna get high, nigga\nYou need git up, git out and git something\nHow will you make it if you never even try?\nYou need to git up, git out and git something\nCause you and I got to do for you and I\nThat's why\n\n[Verse 2: Big Boi]\nWell, uh, get up, stand up, so what's said, you dickhead?\nSee when I was a youngster, used to wear them fucking Pro Keds\nMy mama made me do it but the devil, he made me smart\nTold me to jack them weak ass niggas for they fucking Starters\nIn the middle school, I was a bigger fool\nI wore with tank tops to show off my tattoo, thought I was cool\nI used to hang out with my daddy's brothers, I call them my uncles\nThey taught me how to smoke herb, I followed them when they ran numbers\nSo in a sense, I was Rosemary's baby\nAnd then I learned the difference between a bitch and a lady\nHell, I treat 'em all like hoes, see I pimped 'em\nBitch never had my money so I never whipped 'em\nSee all the playas came and all the playas went\nA playa ain't a gangsta but a playa can handle his shit, bitch\nYou need to git up, git out, git something\nSmoke out cause it's all about money, money, money\nYeah I said it, a nigga sporting plaits and a Braves hat\nI hang with Rico Wade cause the Dungeon is where the funk's at, boy\nI'm true to Organized cause they raised me\nI'm also down with LaFace cause L.A. Reid, yeah, he pays me\nAnd it's cool, yeah it's real cool getting paid fat pockets\nAnd all that other fat shit like that, ha-ha!\n\n[Hook: Cee-Lo]\nYou need to git up, git out and git something\nDon't let the days of your life pass by\nYou need to git up, git out and git something\nDon't spend all your time tryna get high, nigga\nYou need git up, git out and git something\nHow will you make it if you never even try?\nYou need to git up, git out and git something\nCause you and I got to do for you and I\nThat's why\n\n[Verse 3: Big Gipp]\nA lot of people in my past tried to do me, screw me\nThrow me over in the fire, let me get chunky and charred\nLike a piece of wood and them spirits got the mutant's mind\nI'm getting paranoid and steady looking for the time\nIt's eight in the morning and ain't nobody up yet\nI got my long johns, get my coat and throw on my ball cap\nI'm headed out the door, to get off in my ride\nI'm digging through the ashtray, hoping to have a good day\nI had Jamaica's best and when I light it up, I hear a voice in my head\n(You got to git up, git out and git something)\nNow I know it's on, my day is finally started\nBack up in my crib, eat my shit, break out quick, in my slick\n'84 Sedan DeVille, steady bouncing\nOut the Point to Campbellton Road\nThe valley of the Southside flow\nEverybody know about that killa that we call blow, so\nKeep your eyes peeled for the COBRA unit\nCause they known for jumping out of black Chevy trucks and through the fog\nHere come the Red Dogs, I'm busting out around the corner in my hog\nDipping from the area, I'm scared\nSo one of these bitches might wind up dead, cause I have no time for jail\nFuck Clampett cops, fuck Elgin Bell\nAnd crooked ass Jackson, got the whole country\nThinking that my city is the big lick for '96\n'94, Big Gipp, Goodie Mo\nOutKast, a vision from the past\nHootie Hoo!\nMy White Owls are burning kind of slow\n\n[Hook: Cee-Lo]\nYou need to git up, git out and git something\nDon't let the days of your life pass by\nYou need to git up, git out and git something\nDon't spend all your time tryna get high nigga\nYou need git up, git out and git something\nHow will you make it if you never even try?\nYou need to git up, git out and git something\nCause you and I got to do for you and I\nThat's why\n\n[Verse 4: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nY'all telling me that I need to get out and vote, huh, why?\nAin't nobody black running but crac-kers, so, why\nI got to register? I thinking of better shit to do with my time\nNever smelled aroma of diploma, but I write the deep ass rhymes\nSo let me take ya way\nBack to when a nigga stayed in Southwest Atlanta, ay\nY'all could not tell me nothing, thought I hit that bottom rock\nAt age 13, start working at the loading dock\nThey laying my mama off of work, General Motors tripping\nBut I come home banked like Hank, from licking and dipping\nDoing dumb shit, not knowing what a nigga know now\nYeah, that petty shit will have you cased up and locked down\nI dips, over to East Point still actin' a fool\nWasting my time in the school, I'd rather be shooting pool\nCool is how I played the tenth grade\nI thought it was all about macking hoes and wearing pimp fade\nInstead of being in class, I'd rather be up in some ass\nNot thinking about them six courses that I need to pass\nGraduation rolled around like rolly-pollies\nDamn, that's fucked up, I should've listened when my mama told me\nThat, if you play now, you gonna suffer later\nFigured she was talking yang yang so I payed her no attention\nAnd kept missing the point she tried to poke me with\nThe doper that I get, the more I'm feeling broke as shit\nHuh, but that don't matter though, I am an O-U-T-Kast\nSo get up off your ass\n\n[Hook: Cee-Lo]\nYou need to git up, git out and git something\nDon't let the days of your life pass by\nYou need to git up, git out and git something\nDon't spend all your time tryna get high\nYou need git up, git out and git something\nHow will you make it if you never even try?\nYou need to git up, git out and git something\nCause you and I got to do for you and I\n\n[Outro: Cee-Lo]\nYou need to...\nYou need to...\nYou need to...\nYou need to..."}}, {"title": "Player's Ball", "album":

something to do better, bet\nI said subtract, so shut up that, nonsense about some silent night\nI gots it crunk, if it ain't real, ain't right\nI'm like no matter what the season\nForever chill with Smith\nI sip my fifth, I chill with Wesson, got my reasons\nSo tell me what did you expect\nYou thought I'd break my neck, to help y'all deck the halls\nOh naw, I got other means of celebrating\nI'm getting blizzard at HoJo, I got that hoochie waiting\nI made it through another year can't ask for nothing much more\nIt's OutKast for the books I thought you knew so now you know, let's go\n\n[Hook : Sleepy Brown]\nAll the players came from far and wide\nWearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides\nNow I'm here to tell you there's a better day\nWhen the player's ball is happening, all day ery'day\n\n[Verse 2: Big Boi]\nHalle-lu-jah, halle-lu-jah\nY'know I do some things more different than I used to\n'Cause I'm a player, doing what the players do\nThe package store was closed, okay my day is ruined\nThis is ridiculous, I'm getting serious, I'm getting curious\n'Cause the house is smelling stank, the chitlins old as bitches\nI made no wishes cause I'm mobbing folk niggas in the back\nGetting tipsy off the nog and high as hell off the contact smoke\nThey having a smoke out in my back seat\nThey passing herb rewinding verses 'cause it's in the air\nI hit the parks, I hit the cuts, I'm hitting switches\n'Cause I'm switching from side to side looking for hoes and snitches\nI'm wide open on the freeway, my pager broke my vibe\n'Cause a junkie is a junkie three-sixty-five\nIt's just another day of work to me the spirit just ain't in me\nGrab my pistol and my ounce see what them junkies gotta give me\n'Cause it's like that, yeah\nForever pimpin', never slippin', that's how it is\n\n[Hook: Sleepy Brown]\nAll the players came from far and wide\nWearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides\nNow I'm here to tell you there's a better day\nWhen the player's ball is happening, all day ery'day\n\n[Verse 3: Big Boi]\nAin't no chimneys in the ghetto so I won't be hanging my socks on no chimney\nI'm fit as a tick, fix me a plate, I got the remedy\nSome greens and that ham, not\nDon't need no ham hocks, don't play me like I'm smoking rocks\nI got the munchies, we got the Mary Jane in the Dungeon\nJust to let you niggas know in '93, that's how we coming\nSo ho ho hoes, check my king-ass 'fro\nThe gin and juice has got me tipsy so, um\n\n[Verse 4: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nIt goes, give me ten, and I'll serve you then, now we bend\nThe corner in my Cadillac\nMy heart does not go pitty-pat for no rat\nI'm leaning back, my elbow's out the window\nCoke, rum and indo fills my body, where's the party?\nWe roll deep, we dip to Underground, see a lot of hoes around\nI spit my game while waiting countdown\nA five, fo', a three, two, here comes the one\nA new year has begun, P-Funk, spark another one\n\n[Hook: Sleepy Brown]\nAll the players came from far and wide\nWearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides\nNow I'm here to tell you there's a better day\nWhen the player's ball is happening, all day ery'day\n\n[Outro: Peaches]\nHere's a little something for the players out there hustling\nGetting down for theirs\nFrom East Point, College Park, Decatur, Da 'Briar\nYou know, niggas worldwide\nDown, for theirs\n\n[Hook: Sleepy Brown]\nAll the players came from far and wide\nWearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides\nNow I'm here to tell you there's a better day\nWhen the player's ball is happening, all day ery'day", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e13a072642011ccab962d4a067a6aa6d.1000x988x1.jpg", "artist": "OutKast", "raw": {"annotation_count": 33, "api_path": "/songs/5237",

players, all the hustlers\nI'm talking bout a black man heaven here, nahmsayin, yeah\n\n[Verse 1: Andre 3000]\nIt's beginning to look a lot like, what?\nFollow my every step\nTake notes on how I crept\nI's bout to go in depth\nThis is the way I creep my season, here's my ghetto rep\nI kept, to say the least no, no it can't cease\nSo I begin to piece my two and two together\nGots no snowy weather, have to find something to do better, bet\nI said subtract, so shut up that, nonsense about some silent night\nI gots it crunk, if it ain't real, ain't right\nI'm like no matter what the season\nForever chill with Smith\nI sip my fifth, I chill with Wesson, got my reasons\nSo tell me what did you expect\nYou thought I'd break my neck, to help y'all deck the halls\nOh naw, I got other means of celebrating\nI'm getting blizzard at HoJo, I got that hoochie waiting\nI made it through another year can't ask for nothing much more\nIt's OutKast for the books I thought you knew so now you know, let's go\n\n[Hook : Sleepy Brown]\nAll the players came from far and wide\nWearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides\nNow I'm here to tell you there's a better day\nWhen the player's ball is happening, all day ery'day\n\n[Verse 2: Big Boi]\nHalle-lu-jah, halle-lu-jah\nY'know I do some things more different than I used to\n'Cause I'm a player, doing what the players do\nThe package store was closed, okay my day is ruined\nThis is ridiculous, I'm getting serious, I'm getting curious\n'Cause the house is smelling stank, the chitlins old as bitches\nI made no wishes cause I'm mobbing folk niggas in the back\nGetting tipsy off the nog and high as hell off the contact smoke\nThey having a smoke out in my back seat\nThey passing herb rewinding verses 'cause it's in the air\nI hit the parks, I hit the cuts, I'm hitting switches\n'Cause I'm switching from side to side looking for hoes and snitches\nI'm wide open on the freeway, my pager broke my vibe\n'Cause a junkie is a junkie three-sixty-five\nIt's just another day of work to me the spirit just ain't in me\nGrab my pistol and my ounce see what them junkies gotta give me\n'Cause it's like that, yeah\nForever pimpin', never slippin', that's how it is\n\n[Hook: Sleepy Brown]\nAll the players came from far and wide\nWearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides\nNow I'm here to tell you there's a better day\nWhen the player's ball is happening, all day ery'day\n\n[Verse 3: Big Boi]\nAin't no chimneys in the ghetto so I won't be hanging my socks on no chimney\nI'm fit as a tick, fix me a plate, I got the remedy\nSome greens and that ham, not\nDon't need no ham hocks, don't play me like I'm smoking rocks\nI got the munchies, we got the Mary Jane in the Dungeon\nJust to let you niggas know in '93, that's how we coming\nSo ho ho hoes, check my king-ass 'fro\nThe gin and juice has got me tipsy so, um\n\n[Verse 4: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nIt goes, give me ten, and I'll serve you then, now we bend\nThe corner in my Cadillac\nMy heart does not go pitty-pat for no rat\nI'm leaning back, my elbow's out the window\nCoke, rum and indo fills my body, where's the party?\nWe roll deep, we dip to Underground, see a lot of hoes around\nI spit my game while waiting countdown\nA five, fo', a three, two, here comes the one\nA new year has begun, P-Funk, spark another one\n\n[Hook: Sleepy Brown]\nAll the players came from far and wide\nWearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides\nNow I'm here to tell you there's a better day\nWhen the player's ball is happening, all day ery'day\n\n[Outro: Peaches]\nHere's a little something for the players out there hustling\nGetting down for theirs\nFrom East Point, College Park, Decatur, Da 'Briar\nYou know, niggas worldwide\nDown, for theirs\n\n[Hook: Sleepy Brown]\nAll the players came from far and wide\nWearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides\nNow I'm here to tell you there's a better day\nWhen the player's ball is happening, all day ery'day"}}, {"title": "Da Art of Storytellin' (Pt. 2)", "album": "Aquemini", "year": "1998-09-29", "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Andr\u00e9 3000]\n\"Baby, did you hear that?\" \"Yeah, baby, I heard it too\"\nLook out the window, golly, the sky is electric blue\nMama Earth is dying and crying because of you\nRaining cats and jackals, all shackles disintegrate to residue\nSilly mortals haven't a clue as to what the funk is going on\nI'm on the telephone dialing the Dungeon (\"Hello?\")\nThis Dre, bring the MP and the SP\nMeet me at the center of the Earth and travel carefully\nBaby, grab the baby, cause baby, it ain't much time\nMama Earth is tossing and turning and that's a sign\nOmega nigga I.F.O.s are landing in Decatur\nHope I'm not over your head, but if so you will catch on later\nPlayed the track, guess she could not take it anymo'\nRaping her heavenly body like a ho, coochie so'\nFrom niggas constantly fucking her, never loving her\nNever showing appreciation, busting nuts in her face when they done\n\n\"Who said good folks is not supposed to die?\"\n\n[Verse 2: Big Boi]\nThe sky is falling, nobody balling, they done gave back they guns\nFor some tickets to the playoffs, but the Hornets, they won\nNigga, we slum, kept all the guns, I gotta protect my family\nI drove the biggest thing in the house cause I knew they'd try to ram me\nBut I'm stabbing, making my way on expressway the best way I know how\nLook up in the sky, east, west, no clouds\nHim coming now, fuck that money now\nI ask my honey how she feeling and is Jordan okay? \"Yeah, yeah, she chillin'\"\nWe should be at The Dungeon shortly, ain't nobody on they porch, see?\nApproaching the final exit, I'm thinking I see four horsies\nBut I don't though, nigga, you won't know until it's on ya\nI put that on my dope boys from A-Town to California\nAll the weed smell like ammonia but at the Dungeon I know they're smoking\nWriting the raps and doing the beats to make this last recording\nFuck abortion, I got in the booth to run the final portion\nThe beat was very dirty and the vocals had distortion\n\n[Outro: Andr\u00e9 3000]\n\"Who said good folks is not supposed to die?\"\nAll's well, nothing's well\nAll's well, nothing's well\nAll's well, nothing's well\nAll's well, nothing's well\nAll's well, nothing's well\nAll's well, nothing's well\nAll's well,

heard it too\"\nLook out the window, golly, the sky is electric blue\nMama Earth is dying and crying because of you\nRaining cats and jackals, all shackles disintegrate to residue\nSilly mortals haven't a clue as to what the funk is going on\nI'm on the telephone dialing the Dungeon (\"Hello?\")\nThis Dre, bring the MP and the SP\nMeet me at the center of the Earth and travel carefully\nBaby, grab the baby, cause baby, it ain't much time\nMama Earth is tossing and turning and that's a sign\nOmega nigga I.F.O.s are landing in Decatur\nHope I'm not over your head, but if so you will catch on later\nPlayed the track, guess she could not take it anymo'\nRaping her heavenly body like a ho, coochie so'\nFrom niggas constantly fucking her, never loving her\nNever showing appreciation, busting nuts in her face when they done\n\n\"Who said good folks is not supposed to die?\"\n\n[Verse 2: Big Boi]\nThe sky is falling, nobody balling, they done gave back they guns\nFor some tickets to the playoffs, but the Hornets, they won\nNigga, we slum, kept all the guns, I gotta protect my family\nI drove the biggest thing in the house cause I knew they'd try to ram me\nBut I'm stabbing, making my way on expressway the best way I know how\nLook up in the sky, east, west, no clouds\nHim coming now, fuck that money now\nI ask my honey how she feeling and is Jordan okay? \"Yeah, yeah, she chillin'\"\nWe should be at The Dungeon shortly, ain't nobody on they porch, see?\nApproaching the final exit, I'm thinking I see four horsies\nBut I don't though, nigga, you won't know until it's on ya\nI put that on my dope boys from A-Town to California\nAll the weed smell like ammonia but at the Dungeon I know they're smoking\nWriting the raps and doing the beats to make this last recording\nFuck abortion, I got in the booth to run the final portion\nThe beat was very dirty and the vocals had distortion\n\n[Outro: Andr\u00e9 3000]\n\"Who said good folks is not supposed to die?\"\nAll's well, nothing's well\nAll's well, nothing's well\nAll's well, nothing's well\nAll's well, nothing's well\nAll's well, nothing's well\nAll's well, nothing's well\nAll's well, nothing's

way that we walk on a sunny day\nWhen it's rainin' inside and you're all alone\nAll alone, yeah!\n\n[Hook]\n'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down\n(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)\nAnd the whole world loves it when you make that sound\n(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)\nAnd the whole world loves it when you're in the news\n(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)\nAnd the whole world loves it when you sing the blues\n(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)\n\n[Verse 1: Andre 3000]\nTake a little trip, hater, pack up your mind\nLook forward, not behind, then you'll see what you find\nI caught a sucker dyin' 'cause he thought he could rhyme\nNow if his momma is a quarter daughter must be a dime\nI gotta meet her, don't take no shorts, I don't use abbrevi-\n-ation, I don't even play the radio neither\nOnly if I need to know the sports or the weather\nI'm a cool type of brother, but yep, your head I'll sever from the neck\nSee ain't nothing changed, hit the stage\nSet a date, sucker, in battle we can engage\nI'll slice you, wife you, marry you, divorce you\nThrow the Porsche at you, is what I'm forced to do\nWith my back against the wall, crack his back, y'all\nNaw, it ain't went nowhere like havin' hair with stylin' gel in it\nThrow a curl in it\nDread that nappy shit up, throw a shell in it\nWhatever floats your boat, or finds your lost remote\nAnd this for them niggas workin' at the airport who got laid off\nI take my shades off\nIf you look straight in my eyes, you still might see a disguise\nBecause the whole-whole world-world...\n\n[Hook]\n'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down\n(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)\nAnd the whole world loves it when you make that sound\n(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)\nAnd the whole world loves it when you're in the news\n(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)\nAnd the whole world loves it when you sing the blues\n(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)\n\n[Verse 2: Killer Mike]\nPlayer, I grind, my focus is crime\nRaw with the rhyme, I'm slick with the slime\nMy words are diamonds dug out a mine\nSpit 'em, polish, look how they shine\nGlitter, glisten, gloss, floss\nI catch a beat running like Randy Moss\nRide that bitch off like a brand new horse\nI'm rollin' my stone, gather no moss\nMommy, I'm coming, I hope you get off\nOr rock your own boat like Aaliyah, then talk\nBack, back, forth, forth\nGet that sailor on course, course\nMake that track a corpse, corpse\nRap, roll, utterly rocked\nWith my mouth to the mic and my hand on my cock\nCadillac OutKast, just won't stop\n\n[Hook]\n'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down\n(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)\nAnd the whole world loves it when you make that sound\n(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)\nAnd the whole world loves it when you're in the news\n(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)\nAnd the whole world loves it when you sing the blues\n(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)\n\n[Verse 3: Big Boi]\nTurn on the TV and everything is lookin' dismal\nWent in the bathroom medicine cabinet, Pepto-Bismol\nNeed it for my stomach 'cause my tummy kinda aches\nLike a junkie on withdrawal, fresh up off the plate\nWait, back to the enemy of the state\nIs the Republicans or Democratic candidate?\nDebate, now even the black box hold the fate\nClueless like Shaggy and Scooby befo' commercial break\nHate, extreme prejudice, let's dismiss this\nIf you want to, you can dub it to your hit list\nI know you goin' to, we in this to replenish yo' musical wish list\nWhen it come to this music, we stay relentless\nPursuing all that's pursuable\nDoing, God-willing, all things that are doable\nThe only liable limitation is yourself, Dre\nSet it on the right and I'll set it on the left, 'cause\n\n[Hook]\n'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down\n(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)\nAnd the whole world loves it when you make that sound\n(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)\nAnd the whole world loves it when you're in the news\n(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)\nAnd the whole world loves it when you sing the blues\n(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)"}}, {"title":

yeah, yeah, yeah (yo, yo, uh-huh)\nThere's a fine line between love and hate, you see\nCame way too late but, baby, I'm on it\nThere's a fine line between love and hate, you see\nCame way too late but, baby, I'm on it\nCan't worry 'bout what a nigga think, now see\nThat's liberation and, baby, I want it\nCan't worry 'bout what another nigga think\nNow that's liberation and, baby, I want it\n\n[Verse 2: Big Boi]\nLemme hear it, lemme hear it, lemme though, lemme hear it\nHow many times I sit back and contemplate?\nI'm fresh off the dank but I'm tellin' my story\nMy relationship with my folks is give-and-take\nAnd I done took so much, now give me my glory\nTo have a choice to be who you wants to be\nIt's left up-a to me and my momma n'em told me (yes, she did)\nI say, to have a choice to be who you wants to be\nIt's left up-a to me and my momma n'em told me\n\n[Verse 3: Cee-Lo]\nNo, no, no (ah)\nI'm so tired, it's been so long struggling hopelessly\nSeven and forty days (hey)\nOh, I sacrifice every breath I breathe\nTo make you believe I'd give my life away\nOh, Lord, I'm so tired, I'm so tired (tired)\nMy feet feel like I walked most of the road on my own (own)\nAll on my own (yeah)\nWe alive but we ain't livin', that's why I'm givin' until it's gone\n'Cause I don't wanna be alone (I don't wanna be alone)\nI don't wanna be alone (yeah) (no, no, no)\nIf there's anything I can say to help you find your way\nTouch your soul, make it whole, the same for you and I\nThere's not a minute that goes by that I don't believe we could fly\nBut I can feel it in the wind, beginning or the end\nBut people, keep your head to the sky\n\n[Verse 4: Erykah Badu]\nShake that load off, shake that load off\nShake that load off, shake that load off\nShake that load off, shake that load off\nShake that load off, shake that load off\nShake that load off, shake that load off\nShake that load off, shake that load off\nShake that load off, shake that load off\nShake that load off, shake that load off\nShake that load off, shake that load off\nShake that load off, shake that load off\nShake that load off, shake that load off\nShake that load off, shake that load off\nShake that load off, shake that load off\nShake that load off, shake that load off\nShake that load off, shake that load off\nShake that load off, shake that load off\nFolk in your face, you're a superstar\nNiggas hang around cause of who you are\nYou get a lot of love cause of what you got\nSay they happy for you but they really not\nSell a lot of records and you roll a Benz\nSwoll up in the spot, now you losing friends\nAll you wanna do is give the world your heart\nRecord label tried to make you compromise your art\nYou make a million dollars, make a million mo'\nFirst class broad treat you like a nigga po'\nYou wanna say \"Wait!\" but you're scared to ask\nAs your world starts spinning and it's moving fast\nTryin' to stay sane is the price of fame\nSpending your life trying to numb the pain\nYou shake that load off and sing your song\nLiberate the minds, then you go on home\n\n[Verse 5: Big Rube]\nI must admit, they planted a lot of things\nIn the brains and the veins of my strain\nMakes it hard to refrain, from the host of cocaine\nFrom them whores, from the flame\nFrom a post in the game\nMakes it hard to maintain focus\nThey're from the Glock rounds, and lockdowns, and burials\nThe seeds that sow, get devoured by the same locusts\nCause it's a hard row to ho\nIf your ass don't move, and the rain don't fall\nAnd the ground just dry\nBut the roots are strong, so some survive\nSo you're surprised, now I'm bustin cries\nYou got more juice than Zeus\nSlangin lightnin tryin to frighten\nPlains dwellers, of the Serengeti\nBut get beheaded when you falsely dreaded\nMelanin silicon and collagen injected\nDissectin my pride, fool I don't wanna get it started\nWe be the lionhearted, without infanticide\nIt's like that red sprite, you can't imagine it\nUnless you lookin at the canvas of life\nAnd not through the peephole of mortality\nSingle minded mentality\nGettin over on loopholes\nGettin paid two-fold on technicalities\nClickin your heels, scared to voice how you feel\nPacking steel\nPickin cotton from the killing fields with no toe, though\nI don't think we in Kansas no mo' though\nMidwest or Dirty South\nClean dressed or dirty mouth\nWhether robbin preachers or killin Poor Righteous Teachers\nYou a scared demon\nShouldn't be allowed to spread semen\nAnd you cowardly lions never defyin the jackals of Babel\nRunnin with they pack, tail between your legs\nThough the mane on your head say the story\nAs you downplay your glory\nCacklin, helpin the shacklin of your brethren happening\nJust by rappin'\nLibertad"}}, {"title":

route\nTurn each other out\nBurn each other out\nWhere a bona fide nigga like me\nCan't even get no back rub these days\nAin't that bleak on they part\nBut let me hold it down, 'cause they shut you down\nWhen you speak from your heart\nNow that's hard\nWhile we ranting and raving 'bout gats\nNigga, they made them gats\nThey got some shit that'll blow out our backs\nFrom where they stay

we'd be\nExploring each others privates\nHunching with all our clothes on\nUntil we felt excited then, aaaah\nOh, now it's on from here on out\nPut yo hands in the atmosphere\nIf you know what I'm talking about\nNow if too harsh then walk on out\nAnd I'll see you on the next song\nThey call it horny\nBecause it's devilish\nNow see, we dead wrong\n\n[Hook]\nOoooh, I fear the battle's just

give it back, lawd\n'Cause that's like backboards without the rims\nMe and my auntie was tight like Southwest\nBefore the pinks moved in\nLike the niggas who owned the liquor store\nCrack cocaine, pimps and whores\nLiving up on this earth\nBefore a nigga like daddy was born\nBut they be making it seem\nThat my music and crime are a team\nBut I'm speaking the truth not dreams\nSo what in the

it's in my veins\nWhile the rest of the country bungies off bridges\nWithout no snap back\nAnd bitches they say they need that\nTo shake they fannies in the ass clubs\nThey go the other route\nTurn each other out\nBurn each other out\nWhere a bona fide nigga like me\nCan't even get no back rub these days\nAin't that bleak on they part\nBut let me hold it down, 'cause they shut you down\nWhen you speak from your heart\nNow that's hard\nWhile we ranting and raving 'bout gats\nNigga, they made them gats\nThey got some shit that'll blow out our backs\nFrom where they stay at\n\n[Hook]\nOoooh, I fear the battle's just begun\nOoooh, though we're here someday we will be gone\nSo I'm hoping, wishing, praying\nTo keep my faith in you, in you, in you\n\n[Verse 2: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nI'm fascinated by the way yo\nNipples peak at me through yo blouse\nFreaky me, freaky you\nCan't help but be aroused\n'Scuse me, Lord lustful thinking\nBut that's the way we was brought up\nSneaking to watch Playboy at night\nWe all must be caught up in worldly ways\nChemistry between boys and girls\nIs a lot like when we went to the woods\nAnd laid with the squirrels\nDuring P.E., we'd be\nExploring each others privates\nHunching with all our clothes on\nUntil we felt excited then, aaaah\nOh, now it's on from here on out\nPut yo hands in the atmosphere\nIf you know what I'm talking about\nNow if too harsh then walk on out\nAnd I'll see you on the next song\nThey call it horny\nBecause it's devilish\nNow see, we dead wrong\n\n[Hook]\nOoooh, I fear the battle's just begun\nOoooh, though we're here someday we will be gone\nSo I'm hoping, wishing, praying\nTo keep my faith in you, in you, in you\n\n[Verse 3: Big Boi]\nPeople don't know the stress I'm dealing with day to day\nSpeaking about the feeling I'm possessing for Renee\nMoping around and wondering where she stay\nSaw her last that she lay\nGive it another day, I say\nBut the Lord, he taketh away\nNow give it back, lawd\n'Cause that's like backboards without the rims\nMe and my auntie was tight like Southwest\nBefore the pinks moved in\nLike the niggas who owned the liquor store\nCrack cocaine, pimps and whores\nLiving up on this earth\nBefore a nigga like daddy was born\nBut they be making it seem\nThat my music and crime are a team\nBut I'm speaking the truth not dreams\nSo what in the fuck they mean\nMy lyrics ain't clean\n\n[Hook/Outro]\nOoooh, I fear the battle's just begun\nOoooh, though we're here someday we will be gone\nSo I'm hoping, wishing, praying\nTo keep my faith in you, in you\nOoooh, I fear the battle's just begun\nOoooh, though we're here someday we will be gone\nSo I'm hoping, wishing, praying\nTo keep my faith in you, in you\nOoooh, I fear the battle's just begun\nOoooh, though we're here someday we will be gone\nSo I'm hoping, wishing, praying\nTo keep my faith in you, my faith in you, my faith in you\nMy faith in you, my faith in you, my faith in you, my faith in you\nMy faith\u2014"}}, {"title": "13th Floor / Growing Old", "album": "ATLiens", "year": "1996-08-27", "lyrics": "[Intro: Big Rube]\nConceive true deception multiplied a million fold\nVisualize the yin and yang in a battle so intense\nThat we get em confused\nThe resident evil specialize in misconstruing\nWe wanna be at a presidential level\u2014what are we doing?\nFooling ourselves, clowning ourselves, playing ourselves\nBy not being ourselves\nWe can't babble no more than we can bob our head offbeat\nNimrod by the time we forty cause we can't get off meat\nWhile we ask no reason for the misplacement of the season\nLook at the picture that's painted\nTainted as the mind who's blinded to the point\nWhere Sodomites get all the rights\nWe fall for fights with fisticuffs\nGet pissed enough to miss the bus\nIt disgusts me to see my folks run up on\nI say stand upon this section of time marked Revelations\nAnd recognize this mind-numbing reality of horror\nKnown as mankind\nJesus and his twelve disciples make thirteen\nA righteous number of righteous men\nEven Judas the Betrayer came true in the end\nThe Devil say the end is the beginning\nThey teach that we were the product of incest\nInvest no level of self into their system of Paganomics\nStand with us and don't look back upon it\nJust face this mindstate\nOtherwise Babylon\n\n[Hook: Debra Killings]\nLike memories of yesterday\n\n\"Ninety-six gonna be that year\"...\n\n[Verse 1: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nI bet you never heard of a playa with no game\nTold the truth to get what I want, but shot it with no shame\nTake this music dead serious while others entertain\nI see they're making their paper so I guess I can't complain\nOr can I? I feel they're disrespecting the whole thang\nThem hooks like selling dope to black folks\nAnd I choke when the food they serving ain't tasting right\nMy stomach can't digest it even when I bless it\nI'm confessing one more lesson from the South, we in the house tonight\nNow hootie who wants to oppose? Suppose\nWe rolls through Headland and Delowe\nWhere me and my niggas would pass the flow\nAnd got down for ours like hind catchers\nMy mind catches flashbacks to the black past\nWhile mind close niggas laugh at\nThe Southern slang, finger waves and Mojo chicken wangs\nI grew up on booty shake we did not know no better thang\nSo go 'head and, diss it, while real hop-hippers listen\nStarted by Afrika Bambaata, so you and your partner\nGather your thoughts\n\n[Hook: Debra Killings]\nSomething's gotta change\nSounds of laughter and happiness turn my teardrops to rain\nBeen bearing this burden for too many of my days\nLooks like breezes of Autumn done finally blew my way\nLike memories of yesterday\n\n[Verse 2: Big Boi]\nUhh, born Antwan Patton but my partners they call me Big Boi\nIt's the nigga the B-I-G, be speaking the truth not talking that shit boy\nI'm thinking of checking my traps and busting my raps\nAnd throwing them craps\n7 Eleven is no convenience, you pumping your gas but watching your back\nFor the robbing crew; thinking they're robbing you, you must be cautious\nTo staying up on your game and pimping these crows, you must be flawless\nLike Mortal Kombat, but fucking these wombats got you dizzy\nMy nigga you know if I wanna be playin\nBut runnin up on me like you miss me\nYou catching the wrong vibe, packing your shit and rolling your eyes back\nFlexin up on the corner tossin your dice and rollin your Cadillac\nBut man it seems I'm reaching out and touching the wrong nigga\nDon't expect it to be pimping get your index off the trigger\nAs we bust, us, we leavin em in the dust\nSo keep that caine up out of your nose\nI said my piece and then I hush\nAs the calendar keeps flippin', niggas dippin'\n\n[Hook: Debra Killings]\nSomething's gotta change\nSounds of laughter and happiness turn my teardrops to rain\nBeen bearing this burden for too many of my days\nLooks like breezes of Autumn done finally blew my way\nLike memories of yesterday\n\n[Verse 3: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nOur dearly beloved, we are gathered like soap is to lather we come clean\nSome issues need to be addressed like envelopes I mean\nOh, like Liberty Bells, yes them bullets keep on ringing\nOn fire like the Georgia Mass Choir, we keep on sanging\nBringing our folks closer together cause they severed us from the get green\nLight and we ain't gon' stop until we hit the big screen\nPsych, because no one is free when others are oppressed\nSo, we hit the stage and then we fly back to our nest\nGrowing old\n\n[Verse 4: Big Boi]\nLike some eagles, people don't understand\nJust like their parents don't be caring\nI'm speaking bout you playing with that phony stuff you sharing\nIn your raps Mercedes Benz and all your riches\nThinking you got it but get it, get it but you ain't pimping no bitches\n'Cause you flauging; falling like leaves into driveways\nIsn't it lovely smoking good and sloppy head on highways\nFridays are tight but Saturday just makes it old\nWinter nights are hot warm enough to feed your soul\nGrowing old\n\n[Hook: Debra Killings]\nSomething's gotta change\nSounds of laughter and happiness turn my teardrops to rain\nBeen bearing this burden for too many of my days\nLooks like breezes of Autumn done finally blew my way\nLike memories of yesterday\n\n[Outro: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nSee all them leaves must fall down, growing old\nFat titties turn to teardrops as fat ass turns to flab\nSores that was open wounds eventually turn to scab\nTrees bright and green turn yellow-brown\nAutumn caught em, see all them leaves must fall down, growin' old\nSee all them leaves must fall down, growing old\nFat titties turn to teardrops as fat ass turns to flab\nSores that was open wounds eventually turn to scab\nTrees bright and green turn yellow-brown\nAutumn caught em, see all them leaves must fall down, growin' old\nSee all them leaves must fall down, growing old\nFat titties turn to teardrops as fat ass turns to flab\nSores that was

"[Intro: Big Rube]\nConceive true deception multiplied a million fold\nVisualize the yin and yang in a battle so intense\nThat we get em confused\nThe resident evil specialize in misconstruing\nWe wanna be at a presidential level\u2014what are we doing?\nFooling ourselves, clowning ourselves, playing ourselves\nBy not being ourselves\nWe can't babble no more than we can bob our head offbeat\nNimrod by the time we forty cause we can't get off meat\nWhile we ask no reason for the misplacement of the season\nLook at the picture that's painted\nTainted as the mind who's blinded to the point\nWhere Sodomites get all the rights\nWe fall for fights with fisticuffs\nGet pissed enough to miss the bus\nIt disgusts me to see my folks run up on\nI say stand upon this section of time marked Revelations\nAnd recognize this mind-numbing reality of horror\nKnown as mankind\nJesus and his twelve disciples make thirteen\nA righteous number of righteous men\nEven Judas the Betrayer came true in the end\nThe Devil say the end is the beginning\nThey teach that we were the product of incest\nInvest no level of self into their system of Paganomics\nStand with us and don't look back upon it\nJust face this mindstate\nOtherwise Babylon\n\n[Hook: Debra Killings]\nLike memories of yesterday\n\n\"Ninety-six gonna be that year\"...\n\n[Verse 1: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nI bet you never heard of a playa with no game\nTold the truth to get what I want, but shot it with no shame\nTake this music dead serious while others entertain\nI see they're making their paper so I guess I can't complain\nOr can I? I feel they're disrespecting the whole thang\nThem hooks like selling dope to black folks\nAnd I choke when the food they serving ain't tasting right\nMy stomach can't digest it even when I bless it\nI'm confessing one more lesson from the South, we in the house tonight\nNow hootie who wants to oppose? Suppose\nWe rolls through Headland and Delowe\nWhere me and my niggas would pass the flow\nAnd got down for ours like hind catchers\nMy mind catches flashbacks to the black past\nWhile mind close niggas laugh at\nThe Southern slang, finger waves and Mojo chicken wangs\nI grew up on booty shake we did not know no better thang\nSo go 'head and, diss it, while real hop-hippers listen\nStarted by Afrika Bambaata, so you and your partner\nGather your thoughts\n\n[Hook: Debra Killings]\nSomething's gotta change\nSounds of laughter and happiness turn my teardrops to rain\nBeen bearing this burden for too many of my days\nLooks like breezes of Autumn done finally blew my way\nLike memories of yesterday\n\n[Verse 2: Big Boi]\nUhh, born Antwan Patton but my partners they call me Big Boi\nIt's the nigga the B-I-G, be speaking the truth not talking that shit boy\nI'm thinking of checking my traps and busting my raps\nAnd throwing them craps\n7 Eleven is no convenience, you pumping your gas but watching your back\nFor the robbing crew; thinking they're robbing you, you must be cautious\nTo staying up on your game and pimping these crows, you must be flawless\nLike Mortal Kombat, but fucking these wombats got you dizzy\nMy nigga you know if I wanna be playin\nBut runnin up on me like you miss me\nYou catching the wrong vibe, packing your shit and rolling your eyes back\nFlexin up on the corner tossin your dice and rollin your Cadillac\nBut man it seems I'm reaching out and touching the wrong nigga\nDon't expect it to be pimping get your index off the trigger\nAs we bust, us, we leavin em in the dust\nSo keep that caine up out of your nose\nI said my piece and then I hush\nAs the calendar keeps flippin', niggas dippin'\n\n[Hook: Debra Killings]\nSomething's gotta change\nSounds of laughter and happiness turn my teardrops to rain\nBeen bearing this burden for too many of my days\nLooks like breezes of Autumn done finally blew my way\nLike memories of yesterday\n\n[Verse 3: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nOur dearly beloved, we are gathered like soap is to lather we come clean\nSome issues need to be addressed like envelopes I mean\nOh, like Liberty Bells, yes them bullets keep on ringing\nOn fire like the Georgia Mass Choir, we keep on sanging\nBringing our folks closer together cause they severed us from the get green\nLight and we ain't gon' stop until we hit the big screen\nPsych, because no one is free when others are oppressed\nSo, we hit the stage and then we fly back to our nest\nGrowing old\n\n[Verse 4: Big Boi]\nLike some eagles, people don't understand\nJust like their parents don't be caring\nI'm speaking bout you playing with that phony stuff you sharing\nIn your raps Mercedes Benz and all your riches\nThinking you got it but get it, get it but you ain't pimping no bitches\n'Cause you flauging; falling like leaves into driveways\nIsn't it lovely smoking good and sloppy head on highways\nFridays are tight but Saturday just makes it old\nWinter nights are hot warm enough to feed your soul\nGrowing old\n\n[Hook: Debra Killings]\nSomething's gotta change\nSounds of laughter and happiness turn my teardrops to rain\nBeen bearing this burden for too many of my days\nLooks like breezes of Autumn done finally blew my way\nLike memories of yesterday\n\n[Outro: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nSee all them leaves must fall down, growing old\nFat titties turn to teardrops as fat ass turns to flab\nSores that was open wounds eventually turn to scab\nTrees bright and green turn yellow-brown\nAutumn caught em, see all them leaves must fall down, growin' old\nSee all them leaves must fall down, growing old\nFat titties turn to teardrops as fat ass turns to flab\nSores that was open wounds eventually turn to scab\nTrees bright and green turn yellow-brown\nAutumn caught em, see all them leaves must fall down, growin' old\nSee all them leaves must fall down, growing old\nFat titties turn to teardrops as fat ass turns to flab\nSores that was open wounds eventually turn to scab\nTrees bright and green turn yellow-brown\nAutumn caught em, see all them leaves must fall down, growin' old"}}, {"title": "Two Dope Boyz (In a Cadillac)", "album": "ATLiens", "year": "1996-08-27", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nGreetings, earthlings\n\n[Verse 1: Big Boi]\nFrom the bottom of my lungs a nigga be blowing\nSpitting his game\nComing up on ya from the South, the A-T-Liens ain't changed\nCooler than most players claim to be\nA nigga that's from the A-Town see\nThe home of the Bankhead Bounce\nCampbellton Road and other city streets\nEnough of the verality, fallacy, butter we speak not fiction\nSpeaking of pulling yo girl looking at Jheri curls you bitches\nEverytime I rhyme for y'all, I'm looking to prove a point\nKicking a freestyle every now and then\nBut mostly off the joint\nSee I smoke good cause see it go good wit them flows, bwoi\nThe nigga the B-I-G like Tony Rich nobody knows why\nBut me and my folks, cause y'all niggas jokes like the Joker\nI'm sick of these wack ass rappers like I'm tired of hoes in chokers\n\n[Hook : Andr\u00e9 3000 & Peaches]\nWho them boys that be having it crunk every occasion\nThis side niggas dusting, that side niggas lacing\nBut in the middle we stay calm, we just drop bombs\nAsking where we come from?

game\nComing up on ya from the South, the A-T-Liens ain't changed\nCooler than most players claim to be\nA nigga that's from the A-Town see\nThe home of the Bankhead Bounce\nCampbellton Road and other city streets\nEnough of the verality, fallacy, butter we speak not fiction\nSpeaking of pulling yo girl looking at Jheri curls you bitches\nEverytime I rhyme for y'all, I'm looking to prove a point\nKicking a freestyle every now and then\nBut mostly off the joint\nSee I smoke good cause see it go good wit them flows, bwoi\nThe nigga the B-I-G like Tony Rich nobody knows why\nBut me and my folks, cause y'all niggas jokes like the Joker\nI'm sick of these wack ass rappers like I'm tired of hoes in chokers\n\n[Hook : Andr\u00e9 3000 & Peaches]\nWho them boys that be having it crunk every occasion\nThis side niggas dusting, that side niggas lacing\nBut in the middle we stay calm, we just drop bombs\nAsking where we come from? South Post slums\nIt's just two dope boys in a cadillac\nIt's just two dope boys in a cadillac\n\n[Verse 2: Andre 3000]\nThis ol' sucka MC stepped up to me\nChallenged Andre to a battle and I stood there patiently\nAs he spit and stumbled over cliches, so called freestyling\nWhole purpose just to make me feel low, I guess you wilding\nI say look boi, I ain't for that fuck shit; so fuck this\nLet me explain \"only child\" style so you don't dis'\nI grew up to myself not round no park bench\nJust a nigga busting flows off in apartments\n\n[Hook : Andr\u00e9 3000 & Peaches]\nWho them boys that be having it crunk every occasion\nThis side niggas dusting, that side niggas lacing\nBut in the middle we stay calm, we just drop bombs\nAsking where we come from? South Post slums\nIt's just two dope boys in a cadillac\nIt's just two dope boys in a cadillac\n\n[Verse 3: Big Boi]\nIt goes Broughams to the Fleetwoods, Coupes to the Villes\nHitting Girbauds and off these flows we having the playa chill\nIn this atmosphere this ain't no practice here\nWe cutting the fool now\nI'm doing ya at the house and throwing you out because I'm through now\nDon't you love the way we claiming Bankhead, stankhead\nLooking around the SWATS for the herb that's never tainted\nFainted when you heard the burban serving on the block\nAnd all you biting individuals need to check yourselfs and stop\n\n[Verse 4: Andre 3000]\nYeah tight like nuts and bolts, sluts and hoes they get evicted\nI'm dealing wit Queens in my castle ain't worth it to risk it\nNow tricks be looking at me like I'm they way up out the pro-jects\nCan't put you on my payroll, and no I ain't got no Rolex\nOr no diamond at the exit with a sign saying \"We'll rap for food\"\nMy face is bawled up cause I ain't in a happy mood\nWhile my partner got the squeegee and the windex\nCause somewhere in my life I done went wrong just like a syntax\nError, bring the terror to your dome like PE\nProne to finish this out cause this be a freestyle\n\n[Hook: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nNow who them boys that be having the crunk every occasion?\nThis side niggas dustin', that side niggas lacin'\nBut in the middle we stay calm\nWe just drop\u2013\n(Explosion)"}}, {"title": "Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik", "album": "Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik", "year": "1994-06-20", "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Big Boi]\nWell, it's the M-I-crooked letter coming around the South\nRolling straight Hammers and Vogues in that old Southern slouch\nPlease, ain't nothing but incense in my atmosphere\nI'm bending corners in my 'Lac, boi\n'Cause that's how we be rolling here\nDeep, the slang is in effect because it's Georgia\nKicking the khakis and Adidas\nPacking yo' heaters 'cause you 'sposed to, cousin\nCatfish and grits is how my flow flows\nRolling steady in that Caddy but them 50 bottles got to go\nSee, juice and gin used to be my friend from the beginning\nNow I'm just a player sipping sauce every now and then\nTo catch a buzz like a bumble bee\nNiggas who tried to fuck with me\nGet sprayed like Raid 'cause it ain't nothing to see\n\n[Verse 2: Andre 3000]\nMy heat is in the trunk along with that quad knock\nNo, my heart don't pump no Kool-Aid\nJump and you'll get too sprayed\nWho raise yo' block? The one and only OutKast\nMany a nigga falling fast and I continue blasting, swiftly\nThey ain't gon' get me, got something fo' em\nThe devil up in yo' grill and you still don't even know em\nShow 'em who's the OK\nLike collard greens and Hoecakes, I got soul\nThat's something that you ain't got\nThat's why your style is rot\u2013ten\nStop in the land of ATL\nWhere nothing but pimps fully equipped quick to make a sale\nSwell, swollen got my pockets, business booming like rockets\nFolks try to stop it but they know that it's that\n\n[Chorus: Choir]\nIt's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky

knock 'em up off they feet\nLike a Southern hustler supposed to do\nI's in the house like... a joint is lit for my kinfolks\nAnd all the niggas that was down since we been broke\nTaking 'em deeper than a submarine\nSo scream when you hear the team of two\nLook, my crew be thick as two fat hoes sitting off in a Brougham\nI'm packing my tag backwards if you want to be acting wrong\nWord is bond

Coupe de Ville, can you handle that, you rat?\nI take my time cruising 'round the city malls\nAnd under my seat for you suckers is your final curtain call\nThe one two to the gauge, P-U-M-P\nYou want to do a jack, I heat the barrel 'til it's empty, get me?\nSee, I ain't Finlay, getting in where I fit\nOrganized is on the track with the Southernplayalistic shit\nSo copy my slang and bite my shit but don't try gaffling me\n'Cause sleeping you'll get served with some Southern hospitality\n\n[Chorus: Choir]\nIt's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music\nNow, players if you choose it\nYou

today, hoe\nSo back up off it, get up on it if you want it, ya'll\nLooking for hoes and snitches was my thing on Player's Ball, yup\nSo now I step, rather walk with the pimp limp\nWhile my niggas are at East Point with that College Park hemp\nSmoked out is how I wanna end it on this track\nSo I pass it to my partner and step back up in my Cadillac\n\n[Verse 6: Andre 3000]\nStep up in my shoes, you crews sitting on Trues\nAnd Vogues for the hoes only when we rolling through\nAtlanta skies be blue, the sun is beaming, it's seeming\nThat I'm glistening, rather gleaming\n20/20 got me leaning to the side, full of pride\nNow ain't that something?\nI'm dipping into your hood, this ain't Braille, but I'm bumping\nThumping out the roaches, Dungeon if y'all missed it\nBig Gipp, Goodie Mob, PA, OutKast, Southernplayalistic\n\n[Chorus: Choir]\nIt's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music\nNow, players if you choose it\nYou better make sure you don't abuse it\nWe gonna get cha high,

in that old Southern slouch\nPlease, ain't nothing but incense in my atmosphere\nI'm bending corners in my 'Lac, boi\n'Cause that's how we be rolling here\nDeep, the slang is in effect because it's Georgia\nKicking the khakis and Adidas\nPacking yo' heaters 'cause you 'sposed to, cousin\nCatfish and grits is how my flow flows\nRolling steady in that Caddy but them 50 bottles got to go\nSee, juice and gin used to be my friend from the beginning\nNow I'm just a player sipping sauce every now and then\nTo catch a buzz like a bumble bee\nNiggas who tried to fuck with me\nGet sprayed like Raid 'cause it ain't nothing to see\n\n[Verse 2: Andre 3000]\nMy heat is in the trunk along with that quad knock\nNo, my heart don't pump no Kool-Aid\nJump and you'll get too sprayed\nWho raise yo' block? The one and only OutKast\nMany a nigga falling fast and I continue blasting, swiftly\nThey ain't gon' get me, got something fo' em\nThe devil up in yo' grill and you still don't even know em\nShow 'em who's the OK\nLike collard greens and Hoecakes, I got soul\nThat's something that you ain't got\nThat's why your style is rot\u2013ten\nStop in the land of ATL\nWhere nothing but pimps fully equipped quick to make a sale\nSwell, swollen got my pockets, business booming like rockets\nFolks try to stop it but they know that it's that\n\n[Chorus: Choir]\nIt's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music\nNow, players if you choose it\nYou better make sure you don't abuse it\nWe gonna get cha high, high\n\n[Verse 3: Andre 3000]\nTime to drop these 'bows like Dusty Rhodes\nThen I yell \"ho,\" and knock 'em up off they feet\nLike a Southern hustler supposed to do\nI's in the house like... a joint is lit for my kinfolks\nAnd all the niggas that was down since we been broke\nTaking 'em deeper than a submarine\nSo scream when you hear the team of two\nLook, my crew be thick as two fat hoes sitting off in a Brougham\nI'm packing my tag backwards if you want to be acting wrong\nWord is bond like super glue, it's funky like poopa scoop\nAnd every word I say you can true\n\n[Verse 4: Big Boi]\nWell, okey dokey, 'Kast out\nI swear to God I got the highest booming Cadillac\nThe expialalistic Coupe de Ville, can you handle that, you rat?\nI take my time cruising 'round the city malls\nAnd under my seat for you suckers is your final curtain call\nThe one two to the gauge, P-U-M-P\nYou want to do a jack, I heat the barrel 'til it's empty, get me?\nSee, I ain't Finlay, getting in where I fit\nOrganized is on the track with the Southernplayalistic shit\nSo copy my slang and bite my shit but don't try gaffling me\n'Cause sleeping you'll get served with some Southern hospitality\n\n[Chorus: Choir]\nIt's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music\nNow, players if you choose it\nYou better make sure you don't abuse it\nWe gonna get cha high, high\n\n[Verse 5: Big Boi]\nWell, Southernplayalisticadillac music has been laid\nI may wait for all day and day, be rolling like that today, hoe\nSo back up off it, get up on it if you want it, ya'll\nLooking for hoes and snitches was my thing on Player's Ball, yup\nSo now I step, rather walk with the pimp limp\nWhile my niggas are at East Point with that College Park hemp\nSmoked out is how I wanna end it on this track\nSo I pass it to my partner and step back up in my Cadillac\n\n[Verse 6: Andre 3000]\nStep up in my shoes, you crews sitting on Trues\nAnd Vogues for the hoes only when we rolling through\nAtlanta skies be blue, the sun is beaming, it's seeming\nThat I'm glistening, rather gleaming\n20/20 got me leaning to the side, full of pride\nNow ain't that something?\nI'm dipping into your hood, this ain't Braille, but I'm bumping\nThumping out the roaches, Dungeon if y'all missed it\nBig Gipp, Goodie Mob, PA, OutKast, Southernplayalistic\n\n[Chorus: Choir]\nIt's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music\nNow, players if you choose it\nYou better make sure you don't abuse it\nWe gonna get cha high, high\nIt's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music\nNow, players if you choose it\nYou better make sure you don't abuse it\nWe gonna get cha high, high\nIt's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music\nNow, players if you choose it\nYou better make sure you don't abuse it\nWe gonna get cha high, high"}}, {"title": "Skew It on the Bar-B", "album": "Aquemini", "year": "1998-08-23", "lyrics": "[Intro: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nAh-ye-ye, yeah!

is crunk in the Dungeon\nIt goes on and on and on, like that\nGoing out to the Jeeps and hoes in the 'llac\nAh suki, suki, all day, e'rr day, any day, every damn day\nI be thinking about the good ol' days when I was a whippersnapper\nUsed to try to get a kiss, but now it be them draws I'm after\nI'm just a Southernplayalistic pimp\nI used to slang a fat rock, but now I'm serving hemp\nI never even smoked a crumb of crack, but yo I'm dope\nMo' doper than a junkie or a Pookie cause it's on\nSo each one, teach one, I be claiming true\nTo East Pointe and College Park and the things I used to do\nAround ATL, home of the pimps and the money makers\nClub Nikki, Magic City and them Southern playas\nI never said I was a gangsta but I will do ya\nSo Hallelujah, Hallelujah\nOne for the playas at the crib, drinking drinks\nAnd two is for the sound, Hootie Hoo that I make\n\n[Hook]\nHootie Hoo\nTight like hallways, smoked out always (Hootie Hoo)\nYeah, Hootie Hoo\nBig Boi's on my left, Andre's on my right\nTight like hallways, smoked out always (Hootie Hoo)\n\n[Verse 2: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nNow playing these bitches is my favorite sport\nBut ain't no game when they be calling your name in the court\nOh, it's Saturday night, I guess that makes it alright\nGot an obese twenty sack, fully packed, it's so tight\nThat it's busting out the seams, yes sir, I'm set\nOh, but let me tuck the 380 before I jet\nHops off in the Lac with Big Gipp, you got a light? (Hootie Hoo)\nCommunication device dun went off twice\nShould I answer the call, yes, we macking 'em all\nWe met 'em up in the mall, recall Player's Ball\nWell, it's Player's Ball 2, so I guess I'll call you\nLater on, and then your whole crew can fall through\nNow later on done got here\nI takes a peek, now let me see, what do we got here?\nDraws, falling down like niggas in a drive-by\nI got up in them hoes and I told 'em bye bye\nAbout two weeks later, she called me with some bullshit\nTalking 'bout her period late, guess what I did\n*click* naw, it couldn't be me, not me\n\n[Hook]\nHootie Hoo,Big Boi's on my left, Andre's on my right\nTight like hallways, smoked out always (Hootie Hoo)\nYeah, Hootie Hoo\nBig Boi's on my left, Andre's on my right\nTight like hallways, smoked out always (Hootie Hoo)\n\n[Verse 3: Big Boi]\nWell you know we getting blizzard\nCause we got that chicken gizzard\nIn the dungeon and scope\nBut some of you niggas can't cope with it\nSo, Opie, hip hop, to the front, to the back and it don't stop\nFrom the streets of ATL to the slums of College Park\nSo God Almighty know, it's Outkast for the '94 era\nYou heard the player's call, we taking it to another level\nSo 'lujah, Halle, let me get a swallow of that Martell\nAnd you may go to hell\n\n[Verse 4: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nSet sail with a nigga from ATL, Southwest that is\nIt's that Southern sess in your chest that is\nOne mo' 'gain for my friend who don't take\nNo bullshit from no bitch who is stank\nI ain't the sugar daddy nigga who will pay you\nSilly of you to think that I would, but I will lay you\nDown like some vocals, you can quote those\nHead, till I'm dead, yes it's down yo throatholes\nDon't get me wrong to disrespect is not my shit\nBut if you fall in this category, then youse a bitch\nHootie Hoo\n\n[Hook]\nHootie Hoo, Big Boi's on my left, Andre's on my right\nTight like hallways, smoked out always (Hootie Hoo)\nYeah, Hootie Hoo\nBig Boi's on my left, Andre's on my

Happy Valentine's Day, hey (Every day the 14th)\nNow I may have it all wrong, see\nIf you know what loves mean, well\nWell, somebody tell me\n'Cause they just don't believe in me\n\n[Chorus: Joi and Screechy Peach & Andr\u00e9 3000]\nYa won't believe in me\nBut you would fancy leprechauns or groundhogs\nNo, thank you, Easter Bunny\nThere's so much fuss about Santa Claus, but see\nCupid will not be defeated\n\n[Verse 3: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nHappy Valentine's Day, every day the 14th\nNow, I know your hearts have grown cold\nAnd that bothers me\nNow, I understand, 'cause I used to be a bad boy in my day\nI know you tryin' to protect your lil' feelings\nBut you can't run away\nHo-oh\n\n[Chorus: Joi and Screechy Peach & Andr\u00e9 3000]\nYa won't believe in me\nBut you would fancy\nHey, don't you supposed to be\nSome kind of player, or something?\nBunny\n\n[Post-Chorus: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nWell, keep on running, player\n'Cause I got my good shoes on\nAnd I got 'em tied up tight\nSo you gon' find out tonight\n\n[Verse 4: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nGot a sweet lil' darlin' back in my corner\nBelow, I know I love her, but act like I don't want her\nSurrounded by the lovely, but yet, feel like a loner\nCould be an organ donor the way I give up my heart\nBut never know because, shit, I never tell her\nAsk me how I'm feeling, I'd holla that it's irrele\u2013\nI don't get myself caught up in the Jello jella\nAnd pudding pops, that others opt to call falling in love\nBut for the record, have you ever rode a horse?\nLike for you to send me to Pluto, I said, \"Of course!\"\nBut if you ain't a sweety, indeedy, I won't endorse\nHan Solo 'til I'm hit by the bullet, so may the force\nBe with you and I'll hit you when better time permits\nFor now, show me samples, examples why you're the shit\nBut how am I to know with the profession that I'm in?\nAnd if you do not know me then how could you be my friend?\n\n[Outro: Joi and Screechy Peach & Andr\u00e9 3000]\nHappy Valentine's, Happy Valentine's\nHappy Valentine's Day (Happy Valentine's Day)\nHappy Valentine's, Happy Valentine's\nHappy Valentine's Day (Happy Valentine's Day)\nHappy Valentine's, Happy Valentine's\nHappy Valentine's Day (Happy Valentine's Day)\nHappy Valentine's, fuck that Valentine's\nFuck that Valentine's Day (Fuck that Valentine's Day)\nFuck that Valentine's, fuck that Valentine's\nFuck that Valentine's Day (Fuck that Valentine's Day)\nFuck that Valentine's, fuck that Valentine's\nFuck that Valentine's Day (Fuck that Valentine's Day)\nFuck that Valentine's, fuck that Valentine's\nFuck that Valentine's Day (Fuck that Valentine's Day)\nFuck that Valentine's, fuck that Valentine's\nFuck that Valentine's Day", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9c95e6c91deee00543064991b835ada0.999x999x1.jpg",

14th)\nI don't think y'all heard me\nI just wanna say Happy Valentine's Day (Every day the 14th)\nCan y'all dig that?\nNow when arrows don't penetrate, see (Cupid grabs the pistol)\nUh, yeah, now, now lookie here\nHe shoots straight for your heart, now, and he won't miss you\nBut that's alright, y'all won't believe in me anyway, but\n\n[Chorus: Joi and Screechy Peach & Andr\u00e9 3000]\nYa won't believe in me\nBut you would fancy leprechauns or groundhogs\nNo, thank you, Easter Bunny\nThere's all this talk about Santa Claus, but see\nLove will rule supreme\n\n[Verse 2: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nHappy Valentine's Day (Every day the 14th)\nYou got it, when Cupid knocks at your door (You can't ignore me)\nThere's no need to run\nSo, Happy Valentine's Day, hey (Every day the 14th)\nNow I may have it all wrong, see\nIf you know what loves mean, well\nWell, somebody tell me\n'Cause they just don't believe in me\n\n[Chorus: Joi and Screechy Peach & Andr\u00e9 3000]\nYa won't believe in me\nBut you would fancy leprechauns or groundhogs\nNo, thank you, Easter Bunny\nThere's so much fuss about Santa Claus, but see\nCupid will not be defeated\n\n[Verse 3: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nHappy Valentine's Day, every day the 14th\nNow, I know your hearts have grown cold\nAnd that bothers me\nNow, I understand, 'cause I used to be a bad boy in my day\nI know you tryin' to protect your lil' feelings\nBut you can't run away\nHo-oh\n\n[Chorus: Joi and Screechy Peach & Andr\u00e9 3000]\nYa won't believe in me\nBut you would fancy\nHey, don't you supposed to be\nSome kind of player, or something?\nBunny\n\n[Post-Chorus: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nWell, keep on running, player\n'Cause I got my good shoes on\nAnd I got 'em tied up tight\nSo you gon' find out tonight\n\n[Verse 4: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nGot a sweet lil' darlin' back in my corner\nBelow, I know I love her, but act like I don't want her\nSurrounded by the lovely, but yet, feel like a loner\nCould be an organ donor the way I give up my heart\nBut never know because, shit, I never tell her\nAsk me how I'm feeling, I'd holla that it's irrele\u2013\nI don't get myself caught up in the Jello jella\nAnd pudding pops, that others opt to call falling in love\nBut for the record, have you ever rode a horse?\nLike for you to send me to Pluto, I said, \"Of course!\"\nBut if you ain't a sweety, indeedy, I won't endorse\nHan Solo 'til I'm hit by the bullet, so may the force\nBe with you and I'll hit you when better time permits\nFor now, show me samples, examples why you're the shit\nBut how am I to know with the profession that I'm in?\nAnd if you do not know me then how could you be my friend?\n\n[Outro: Joi and Screechy Peach & Andr\u00e9 3000]\nHappy Valentine's, Happy Valentine's\nHappy Valentine's Day (Happy Valentine's Day)\nHappy Valentine's, Happy Valentine's\nHappy Valentine's Day (Happy Valentine's Day)\nHappy Valentine's, Happy Valentine's\nHappy Valentine's Day (Happy Valentine's Day)\nHappy Valentine's, fuck that Valentine's\nFuck that Valentine's Day (Fuck that Valentine's Day)\nFuck that Valentine's, fuck that Valentine's\nFuck that Valentine's Day (Fuck that Valentine's Day)\nFuck that Valentine's, fuck that Valentine's\nFuck that Valentine's Day (Fuck that Valentine's Day)\nFuck that Valentine's, fuck that Valentine's\nFuck that Valentine's Day (Fuck that Valentine's

the way you're living, oooh\nBut, see, they can't fill your shoes\nLife is made of half illusion, evolution\nForty percent confusion, oooh\nWhatever's left I'm using to keep myself from losing, yeah\nYou don't know what I've been through, oooh\nHell, I might go through you\nGhetto boy that won't eat tonight\nUh-oh, oh-no-oahohh\nThat little boy just wanna eat tonight, hey, hey, hey, hey\nHe scuffles with her booty and her face\nAnd mm-mmmmmm\nMom I'm seekin that Sir Tea and some soup, yeah\nAll in all, it's all in my head\n\n[Verse 1: Big Boi]\nYou know it's that high guy, from East P.I\nSpittin the realness of reality, you mad at me\nBoi how you gonna handle me?\nYou want me to lolligag and talk that bullshit?\nI refuse to play so I'm gon' speak that Southern good shit\nThat harder than yo' hood shit, lil' shit\nThat make y'all niggas think about the trigger\nBefore you pull it, on liquor stores and banks\nThem folks got more than enough bullets to put that ass\nOff in the slang, don't claim no gang, we the niggas\nThat did that \"Ain't No Thang But a Chicken Wang\"\nBut still though, how you gonna play a nigga like dildo\nWe OutKast til it's over, barbecue and never mildew\nFor real bro\n\n[Interlude]\n\"In tonight's news, 20th century technology:\nHas the computer age, scientists, and doctors gone too far?\nEinstein or Frankenstein?\nDr. Scholl's, or Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde?\nAre we digging into new ground\nOr digging our own graves?

try this at home\nIt's just a poem until y'all learn right from wrong\nKnow when to bless a situation, when to grab the chrome\nBut it's back on, another stormy night in Atlanta, Georgia\nOvercast, but on behalf of Outkast, I cordia-lly\nInvite you to an emotion-filled theater\nBring your umbrella 'cause young fella it gets no weirder\n\n[Hook: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nWe reign, reign, supreme, 'preme\nDungeon, dungeon kings\nDo you know what brings rats, mice, snakes up out of they hole?\nChonkyfire, spliced with rock n'roll indubitably, piper pied\nNow hold on, my brother, no, no, no, no, can't stop the stride\nDo you know what brings rats, mice, snakes up out of they hole?\nChonkyfire, spliced with rock n'roll indubitably, piper pied\nNow, now just hold on, my brother, no, no, no, no,

one bob they head would be the track job\nYour job's to spit that fire\nSome of y'all MC's take this rhymin' for granted, I won't comply\nWith that slackin', poppin' and crackin' Fourth Ward say we snappin'\nThey want that hardness that oddness that gets a nigga to start this\nWhat's happenin', see if do what yo won't do today boy\nWill I live tomorrow like you can't even live 'cause you strayed\nMotivational skills lackin', when I see you nigga you packin'\nUnderstand that though, you behind a $75,000 car doe\nBut still stay with mom though, playing the King like Don doe\nYou choked up, you was the nigga that supposed to be so loced up\nMakin' them think Hip Hop is dead, exhume the body if you ain't scared\nAnd if I see you in the streets I'd dap you down like you was Greg yeah\n\n[Hook: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nWe reign, reign, supreme, preme, dungeon, dungeon kings\nDo you know what brings rats, mice, snakes up out of they hole?\nChonkyfire, spliced with rock n'roll

got me reminiscing\nAbout the days back when me mammy had to work in kitchens\nShe had me making better grades to make a better life\nBut I never had no love or respect, 'cause we's gon' be alright\nI ran the streets and broke my curfew 'cause I gave a shit\nI carried guns and butcher knives 'cause I was steadily in the mix\nYeah, it was so hard to say goodbye, I'm a man now\nI'm at the end of my street, so it's time to take my stand now\nI call the wild because it's time to take the streets\nSo if you ain't got the vertebrae or big enough nuts, retreat\nI'm ready to wet 'em up like cereal\nJust an international playa, coming through your stereo\n\n[Chorus]\nAin't no thang but a chicken wang\nWe's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane\nIt's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)\nIt's all about that cess in yo' chest (It's the joint)\nAin't no thang but a chicken wang\nWe's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane\nIt's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)\nIt's all about that cess in yo' chest (It's the joint)\n\n[Verse 3: Andr\u00e9 3000]\n3-5-7 to your forehead\nThere'll be mo' dead 'cause I'm a pro, kid\nBut Lord forgive me, I gots to keep my Milli right Vi-near me\nMy nine be doing fine until these niggas wants to clear me\nOff my street, but in my hood-hood, they hollering ghetto\nDon't got no neighbors, they hit the pipe and never let go\nBut I feel for them like Chaka Khan feel for you\nAin't shit that we can do but rest in peace, pour a brew\nOn the concrete, remember when we ran deep?\nRemember at the party when we served them niggas dandy?\nThey know not to test us, test me, do me, try me\nTripping with that drama, my Beretta's right beside me\nOne is in the air and one is in the chamber\nY'all ask me what the fuck I'm doing, I'm releasing anger\nQuick to dodge danger, I'm taking it one day\nAt a time, I got the fattest dimes around my way\nYou can sway with Andre, I'll take it to the Ho-Jo, bitch\nJust to let you know, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nAin't no thang but a chicken wang\nWe's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane\nIt's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)\nIt's all about that cess in yo' chest (It's the joint)\nAin't no thang but a chicken wang\nWe's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane\nIt's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)\nIt's all about that cess in yo' chest (It's the joint)\n\n[Verse 4: Big Boi]\nIt's on my friend, on the road again, I'm traveling\nDo more than 65 on 85 off in my Cadillac\nI got that nigga Dre, he riding shotgun\nAnd got my pump under my seat\nIn case these youngsters wanna have some fun\nI'd do it if I have to, busting caps with this, a heater\nLoad it clip up after clip, I'm packing my gauge, if I feel it\nThe Glock, the gat, the nine, the heaters\nSee, I be busting caps like my amp be busting speakers\nSo how do you figure that Big Boi be scared to blast you?\nYou 'posed to be the quickest draw, but man, I hail 'em faster\n1-2-3, you need to think about the future\nBefore I shoot your ass and dilute your blood with lead\nFrom my hollow tips, I'll send you to an early grave\nYou fucking slave, you better try another way\nTo take me out is truly something difficult\nDon't even run up on me unless you want your brain broke\nI'm out of bullets, letting loose my last clip\nI'ma kick you in your ass and your nigga getting pistol whipped\nYeah, that's how I do\nYou know that's how I do, you know that's how I do\n\n[Chorus]\nAin't no thang but a chicken wang\nWe's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane\nIt's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)\nIt's all about that cess in yo' chest (It's the joint)\nAin't no thang but a chicken wang\nWe's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane\nIt's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)\nIt's all about that cess in yo' chest (It's the joint)\n\n[Outro: Big Boi]\nYeah, and it don't stop and it don't quit, to the motherfucking\nOrganized Noize, PA, Goodie Mob, Big Gipp and all the niggas\nAround the East Point way\nCollege Park is really on the map\nWe coming around Atlanta and the niggas are really strapped\nWith the motherfucking guns and the motherfucking Glocks\nThe heaters, the gats, nigga, don't fear it and it don't stop", "image":

"[Produced by Organized Noize]\n\n[Intro: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nNiggas in the point ain't changed\nNiggas in the point ain't changed\nYeah...\n\n[Beat switch]\n\n[Verse 1: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nA nigga ready from the get-go (Blaow, blaow, blaow)\nY'all hear my shit go, it's Andre\nCan yo' punk ass come out to play?\nStay in your little hole, then coward duck your head\nYou don't know who you be fucking with, you's better off\nDead is what I say, best run the other way\nIn case of physical breakdown, y'all can break now\nMy kitchen full of heat, if you can't take the temp\nMake yourself exempt\nPussy footing around don't be getting y'all nowhere but stuck\nNowhere to duck, bullets fly, niggas die\nBy getting blasted, how drastic\nThey got the nerve to ask me why I do the things I do\nI got the nerve to serve you up just like a waiter do\nBut naw, I take that back, that's my problem\nTurning and walking away\nThis ain't gon' work when they be robbing\nAs long as Big Boi's still living, never standing by my lonesome\nStep up, nigga, if you want some\n\n[Chorus]\nAin't no thang but a chicken wang\nWe's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane\nIt's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)\nIt's all about that cess in yo' chest (It's the joint)\nAin't no thang but a chicken wang\nWe's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane\nIt's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)\nIt's all about that cess in yo' chest (It's the joint)\n\n[Verse 2: Big Boi]\nWell, nigga, you softer than silicone used to pump up tits\nIt's that nigga down in the Dungeon with them playeristic hits\nI'm quick to stop a sucka flow like menopause at 50\nOriginal ghetto bastard, so now I makes a switch\nI used to sell dope, but in 1994\nI'm making Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik\nBut see these voices in my skull has got me reminiscing\nAbout the days back when me mammy had to work in kitchens\nShe had me making better grades to make a better life\nBut I never had no love or respect, 'cause we's gon' be alright\nI ran the streets and broke my curfew 'cause I gave a shit\nI carried guns and butcher knives 'cause I was steadily in the mix\nYeah, it was so hard to say goodbye, I'm a man now\nI'm at the end of my street, so it's time to take my stand now\nI call the wild because it's time to take the streets\nSo if you ain't got the vertebrae or big enough nuts, retreat\nI'm ready to wet 'em up like cereal\nJust an international playa, coming through your stereo\n\n[Chorus]\nAin't no thang but a chicken wang\nWe's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane\nIt's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)\nIt's all about that cess in yo' chest (It's the joint)\nAin't no thang but a chicken wang\nWe's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane\nIt's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)\nIt's all about that cess in yo' chest (It's the joint)\n\n[Verse 3: Andr\u00e9 3000]\n3-5-7 to your forehead\nThere'll be mo' dead 'cause I'm a pro, kid\nBut Lord forgive me, I gots to keep my Milli right Vi-near me\nMy nine be doing fine until these niggas wants to clear me\nOff my street, but in my hood-hood, they hollering ghetto\nDon't got no neighbors, they hit the pipe and never let go\nBut I feel for them like Chaka Khan feel for you\nAin't shit that we can do but rest in peace, pour a brew\nOn the concrete, remember when we ran deep?\nRemember at the party when we served them niggas dandy?\nThey know not to test us, test me, do me, try me\nTripping with that drama, my Beretta's right beside me\nOne is in the air and one is in the chamber\nY'all ask me what the fuck I'm doing, I'm releasing anger\nQuick to dodge danger, I'm taking it one day\nAt a time, I got the fattest dimes around my way\nYou can sway with Andre, I'll take it to the Ho-Jo, bitch\nJust to let you know, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nAin't no thang but a chicken wang\nWe's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane\nIt's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)\nIt's all about that cess in yo' chest (It's the joint)\nAin't no thang but a chicken wang\nWe's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane\nIt's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)\nIt's all about that cess in yo' chest (It's the joint)\n\n[Verse 4: Big Boi]\nIt's on my friend, on the road again, I'm traveling\nDo more than 65 on 85 off in my Cadillac\nI got that nigga Dre, he riding shotgun\nAnd got my pump under my seat\nIn case these youngsters wanna have some fun\nI'd do it if I have to, busting caps with this, a heater\nLoad it clip up after clip, I'm packing my gauge, if I feel it\nThe Glock, the gat, the nine, the heaters\nSee, I be busting caps like my amp be busting speakers\nSo how do you figure that Big Boi be scared to blast you?\nYou 'posed to be the quickest draw, but man, I hail 'em faster\n1-2-3, you need to think about the future\nBefore I shoot your ass and dilute your blood with lead\nFrom my hollow tips, I'll send you to an early grave\nYou fucking slave, you better try another way\nTo take me out is truly something difficult\nDon't even run up on me unless you want your brain broke\nI'm out of bullets, letting loose my last clip\nI'ma kick you in your ass and your nigga getting pistol whipped\nYeah, that's how I do\nYou know that's how I do, you know that's how I do\n\n[Chorus]\nAin't no thang but a chicken wang\nWe's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane\nIt's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)\nIt's all about that cess in yo' chest (It's the joint)\nAin't no thang but a chicken wang\nWe's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane\nIt's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)\nIt's all about that cess in yo' chest (It's the joint)\n\n[Outro: Big Boi]\nYeah, and it don't stop and it don't quit, to the motherfucking\nOrganized Noize, PA, Goodie Mob, Big Gipp and all the niggas\nAround the East Point way\nCollege Park is really on the map\nWe coming around Atlanta and the niggas are really strapped\nWith the motherfucking guns and the motherfucking Glocks\nThe heaters, the gats, nigga, don't fear it and it don't stop"}}, {"title": "Mamacita", "album": "Aquemini", "year": "1998-09-29", "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Masada]\nMahogany Team Queens up on the rise\nBe careful, watch your back,

According to producer Rico Wade, this song wasn\u2019t originally created for OutKast:\n\n\nI just had the beat playing and I know my vibe came from fucking with Masada, \u2018cause she\u2019s so New York. She\u2019s from Jersey but when she talks it\u2019s just so New York chick. So I was just fucking with her like, 'Mama-cita.\u2019 And she came right back: \u2018Papa-donna.\u2019 I said: \u2018Let\u2019s go put that shit down right now.\u2019\n\nWe put the hook down right then, she busted the first verse, then Dre came in and heard her rapping on it. It was a project we were working on for Masada and Dana\u2019s side project, Mahogany. But he came in the Dungeon and heard the beat and just made it a song.\n\n\nAndr\u00e9 also provided some insight on the song and his verse:\n\nIt was a groovy kinda thing. Just going back and forth on male/female [relationships]. I had a girlfriend that kinda went that way [lesbian] at one point in time. I was like, \u2018What the fuck is this?\u2019 So I think I was just being affected by it and it ended up coming out in my verse."}, "embed_content": "<div id='rg_embed_link_36224'

album due to the repetitive chorus. According to producer Rico Wade, this song wasn\u2019t originally created for OutKast:\n\n\nI just had the beat playing and I know my vibe came from fucking with Masada, \u2018cause she\u2019s so New York. She\u2019s from Jersey but when she talks it\u2019s just so New York chick. So I was just fucking with her like, 'Mama-cita.\u2019 And she came right back: \u2018Papa-donna.\u2019 I said: \u2018Let\u2019s go put that shit down right now.\u2019\n\nWe put the hook down right then, she busted the first verse, then Dre came in and heard her rapping on it. It was a project we were working on for Masada and Dana\u2019s side project, Mahogany. But he came in the Dungeon and heard the beat and just made it a song.\n\n\nAndr\u00e9 also provided some insight on the song and his verse:\n\nIt was a groovy kinda thing. Just going back and forth on male/female [relationships]. I had a girlfriend that kinda went that way [lesbian] at one point in time. I was like, \u2018What the fuck is this?\u2019 So I think I was just being affected by it and it ended up coming out in my verse."}, "comment_count": 11, "community": true, "custom_preview": null,

too slow\nStick up kids do anything, hustlers keep loot to show (what?)\nThe game is hot you could never be a winner\nJust begun a game so considered a beginner\nMasada for real, this shorty here is here to stay\nMahogany go platinum after that we just parlay\nI'm from the Bricks we get kicks, offa loud gun shot licks\nFuck stones and sticks, loudmouths get nixed\nThis life is plush I be the bill-be-board, Scarface want\nItaliano, I'm the real McCoy, nigga what?\nCan't be a joke I've been through too many games\nNiggas laugh, but my expression wasn't hardly the same\nShow me respect cause it's due, you keep the fear\nCause I'll get over and believe I'll come back at you\n\n[Hook: Masada + Rico Wade]\nMamacita, papadonna\nMamacita, papadonna\nMamacita, papadonna\nMamacita,

dummy\nThe pain that's in your chest done made it's way down to your tummy\nYou wide open, you start smokin' with your girl\nShe nigga-bashin', sayin', \"You don't need em in your world, niggas all dogs!\"\nIf niggas all dogs, then what you call broads?\nFelines in heat, meowin for some yarn balls\nNow you and her done got to drankin'\nOh now it's really crunk, cause y'all silly drunk and your girl done got to thinkin'\nShe talkin bout, \"Girl you look so beautiful\"\nYou say, \"thank you,\" bein' nice, you try to change the subject\nWant some beans and rice? But she's back at you like a pit\nMixed with a chihuahua, how much meaner can you get?\nDon't let her have her way with you, she's gonna have a fit\nYou're the candy apple of her eye and bout to get bit\nHere's what you do -- you\nGrab her by her neck, throw her on the wall\nSay, \"Bitch don't ever disrespect me, never not at all\"\nThese simple words can put a pause to half of the applause\nThen black ball laws of balance at all cost\n\n[Hook: Masada + Rico Wade]\nMamacita, papadonna\nMamacita, papadonna\nMamacita, papadonna\nMamacita, papadonna\n\n[Verse 3: WitchDoctor]\nQue pasa, que pasa?

at\nYeah, Westside is in the house\nFrazier Homes is in the house\nCloverdale is in the house\nAnd Savannah, GA is in the house, so check it\u2026\n\n[Verse 1: Big Boi]\nFebruary 1st, 1975 it happened\nWas born in West Savannah way before I started rappin'\nMy mamma had a nigga at the age of fifteen\nMy daddy was sellin' that sack, now he's gots responsibilities\nStayed at me granny's while me mammy was at work\nAnd she couldn't watch my every move so shit I started servin'\nAround Frazier Home, down in the Westside projects\nChangin' over foodstamps, and hittin' a lick was next see\nI'm just a playa like that, my jeans was sharply creased\nI got a fresh white t-shirt and my cap is slightly pointed East\nSo flyin', or floatin', a Brougham is what I'm sportin'\nSade is in my tape deck, I'm moving in slow motion, boi\nSo meet me deep in the streets that's where I learned the capers\nUs lickin' blunts, lickin' leaves, rolling reefer papers\nI'm slightly slouched, in the seats off in my bucket\nBut the niggas around the Ave. and the hoes, they love me\nThey wanna be me and my family too\nBecause the money that I make be puttin' cable off in every room\nSo follow the fiends, follow my lead through the nooks and crannies\nIt's everyday life off in my hood so come and holla at me\nBut go 'head on, with that foolishness bitch\nLet me get lovely with my swerve because I'm true to this shit\nAnd if you coming with eight dollars, you shit out of luck\nBecause the Westside ain't taking no shorts on the dime\nSo fire it up\n\n[Hook: Sleepy Brown]\nNow, now, now, nine in my hand, ounce in my crotch\nDiggin' the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmmmhmmmm!\n(like that now, like this, and it don't quit, and it don't stop)\nNine in my hand, ounce in my crotch\nDiggin' the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmmmhmmmm!\n(and it don't stop, and it don't quit, it's like that and ah)\n\n[Verse 2: Big Boi]\nSee, niggas in the South wear gold teeth and gold chains\nBeen doing it for years, so these niggas ain't gone change\nThey coming around the ghetto so you might call em soul\nBeen wearing furry Kangol's, so that shit is old\nYou might slang a rock or two just to pay the rent\nFive dollars for a table dance so now your money's spent\nYou listen to that booty shake music in your trunk\nAs long as there's that \"tic tic\" followed by that bump\nI'm down to stick a ho if she got a G-string\n'Cause the niggas in the Point ain't changed, main\nYou might call us country, but we's only Southern\nAnd I don't give a fuck, P-Funk spot to spark another\n\n[Hook: Sleepy Brown]\nNow, now, now, nine in my hand, ounce in my crotch\nDiggin' the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmmmhmmmm!\n(like that now, like this, and it don't quit, and it don't stop)\nNine in my hand, ounce in my crotch\nDiggin' the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmmmhmmmm!\n(and it don't stop, and it don't quit, it's like that and ah)\nNow, now, now, nine in my hand, ounce in my crotch\nDiggin' the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmmmhmmmm!\n(like that now, like this, and it don't quit, and it don't stop)\nNine in my hand, ounce in my crotch\nDiggin' the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmmmhmmmm!\n(and it don't stop, and it don't quit, it's like that and ah)\nNow, now, now, nine in my hand, ounce in my crotch\nDiggin' the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmmmhmmmm!\n(like that now, like

marriage\nLovely wife and life, baby carriage\nNow all the stars have cars, success of course\nBut it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce\n\n[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]\nAnd I'm a star\nYea, and I don't have to go to Hollywood\n'Cause Hollywood come through my neighborhood with cameras on\nI really think they're stealing from us like a sample song\nI really wish one day we'd take it back like Hammer's home\nThe hurricane come and took my Louisiana home\nAnd all I got in return was a darn country song\nThis whole country wrong\nWhat would you write if you just put a little ice on\nAnd cut your mic on but you don't even write songs\nBut Hollywood make you spit like a python, I meant Cobra\nI'm so not sober I'm high like a Hollywood\nCoffee or soda, you can call me a roller\nHold up, your grill's glistenin'\nSpent a hundred thousand on mine to feel different\nWhat's the real sense of it?\nBling bling, I know and did you know\nI'm the creator of the term, I just straightened the perm\nAin't let it sit too long, they just makin' it burn\nAnd make a movie of our lifestyle, but they earn\nLike a dead body burned on a mantlepiece\nThat's why I try not to lie on wax like this candle grease\nAnd I be's the little nigga, cooler than anti-freeze\nDefrost on your window pane - Lil Wayne\nBut in Hollywood it's Litt-le Wayne, don't make me none\nSo that's why I got a pre-nup\nI do\n\n[Hook: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nStarts off like a small town marriage\nLovely wife and life, baby carriage\nNow all the stars have cars, success of course\nBut it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood

alone\nIf she do got some good head on her let her sing a song\nD is for what I serve, I don't be on no curb\nShe ain't no junkie neither, I ain't no dope dealer\nBut she keep coming back three stacks must be some crack\nPut that pipe in her lap, she ain't know how to act\nNow that I've got your undivided attention, I'm\nGonna say this and run under condition one\nPromise me you gon' stack, promise me you gon' ball\nPromise me you'll invest three fourths of it all\nFor what? So your kids, kids, kids can have some cheese\nCan't get with it? Get get get get get on your knees\n'Cause wealth is the word\nRich is round the corner from the curb\nDon't like what I write? Shoot me a bird\n\n[Verse 3: Big Boi]\n(Starts off)\nTenth grade, the way was pave for me and Dre to create\nLike Dr. Frankenstein the arts and crafts\nNow could we make a difference\nAntwan Patton and Andr\u00e9 Benjamin\nBeen jammin' for you crabbing rap niggas and journalists\nThat's quick to misprint public and private business\nThen retract back for deaf ears and think it's dismissed\nPart two the sequel all new 'Kast\nJust ain't the same gang of nerds on the internet\nSlandering your name behind that screen name\nThey're lame and their life is pretty plain\nM&M's with no nuts\nWon't show up face-to-face straight bitch made\nLike puppies on the nipples of a mutt\nAddress it on a case-by-case basis like the judge\nWhat about these lyin' ass hoes tryin' to plot\nOr these niggas on the block who want the queen\n(Nigga please)\nBut even she can walk we'll miss her we ain't gon' fake it\nBut God don't make mistakes must be something bigger waiting\n\n[Hook: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nStarts off like a small town marriage\nLovely wife and life, baby carriage\nNow all the stars have cars, success of course\nBut it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce\n\n[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]\nI do, love you but you hate me at the same time\nLights, camera, action, it's game time\nDo you take this here as your lovely wife?\nTo love her and cherish her for all your life?\nI solemnly swear to dare share take you there\nAnd me and you together baby we a lucky pair\nIt's been a long time, we walked a thin line\nOthers say they got you but you been mine\nAs I sit back and watch all them cat fights\nDomestic violence \u2014 is that right?\nBut you love the Dogg, gave me the spotlight\nAnd now I'm growin' up, showin' up, blowin' up\nI never ever thought that we would separate at all\nBut you played me like a game of football\nUsed to feed me, need me, dress me\nNow it's so messy straight cut out and left me\n\n[Outro: Andr\u00e9 3000 + Snoop Dogg]\nHollywood divorce\nAll the fresh styles always start off as a good little hood thing\nLook at blues, rock, jazz, rap\nNot even talkin' about music\nEverything else too\nBy the time it reach Hollywood it's over\nBut it's cool\nWe just keep it goin' and make new shit\nTake our game, take our name\nGive us a little fame\nAnd then they kick us to the curb that's a cold thang", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bd56aed022f1f74a51d3fc38fa34172f.900x900x1.jpg", "artist": "OutKast", "raw": {"annotation_count": 22, "api_path": "/songs/2229", "apple_music_id": "177391062", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/2229/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "\u201cHollywood Divorce\u201d is the fourth single to be released from OutKast\u2019s sixth studio album, Idlewild.

divorce, Hollywood divorce\n\n[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]\nAnd I'm a star\nYea, and I don't have to go to Hollywood\n'Cause Hollywood come through my neighborhood with cameras on\nI really think they're stealing from us like a sample song\nI really wish one day we'd take it back like Hammer's home\nThe hurricane come and took my Louisiana home\nAnd all I got in return was a darn country song\nThis whole country wrong\nWhat would you write if you just put a little ice on\nAnd cut your mic on but you don't even write songs\nBut Hollywood make you spit like a python, I meant Cobra\nI'm so not sober I'm high like a Hollywood\nCoffee or soda, you can call me a roller\nHold up, your grill's glistenin'\nSpent a hundred thousand on mine to feel different\nWhat's the real sense of it?\nBling bling, I know and did you know\nI'm the creator of the term, I just straightened the perm\nAin't let it sit too long, they just makin' it burn\nAnd make a movie of our lifestyle, but they earn\nLike a dead body burned on a mantlepiece\nThat's why I try not to lie on wax like this candle grease\nAnd I be's the little nigga, cooler than anti-freeze\nDefrost on your window pane - Lil Wayne\nBut in Hollywood it's Litt-le Wayne, don't make me none\nSo that's why I got a pre-nup\nI do\n\n[Hook: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nStarts off like a small town marriage\nLovely wife and life, baby carriage\nNow all the stars have cars, success of course\nBut it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce\n\n[Verse 2: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nYeah, Yeah\nA is for Adamsville\nB is Bowen Homes\nSee if I give a fuck if you like me you know I don't\nIf she ain't got a good head on her leave that ho alone\nIf she do got some good head on her let her sing a song\nD is for what I serve, I don't be on no curb\nShe ain't no junkie neither, I ain't no dope dealer\nBut she keep coming back three stacks must be some crack\nPut that pipe in her lap, she ain't know how to act\nNow that I've got your undivided attention, I'm\nGonna say this and run under condition one\nPromise me you gon' stack, promise me you gon' ball\nPromise me you'll invest three fourths of it all\nFor what? So your kids, kids, kids can have some cheese\nCan't get with it? Get get get get get on your knees\n'Cause wealth is the word\nRich is round the corner from the curb\nDon't like what I write? Shoot me a bird\n\n[Verse 3: Big Boi]\n(Starts off)\nTenth grade, the way was pave for me and Dre to create\nLike Dr. Frankenstein the arts and crafts\nNow could we make a difference\nAntwan Patton and Andr\u00e9 Benjamin\nBeen jammin' for you crabbing rap niggas and journalists\nThat's quick to misprint public and private business\nThen retract back for deaf ears and think it's dismissed\nPart two the sequel all new 'Kast\nJust ain't the same gang of nerds on the internet\nSlandering your name behind that screen name\nThey're lame and their life is pretty plain\nM&M's with no nuts\nWon't show up face-to-face straight bitch made\nLike puppies on the nipples of a mutt\nAddress it on a case-by-case basis like the judge\nWhat about these lyin' ass hoes tryin' to plot\nOr these niggas on the block who want the queen\n(Nigga please)\nBut even she can walk we'll miss her we ain't gon' fake it\nBut God don't make mistakes must be something bigger waiting\n\n[Hook: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nStarts off like a small town marriage\nLovely wife and life, baby carriage\nNow all the stars have cars, success of course\nBut it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce\n\n[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]\nI do, love you but you hate me at the same time\nLights, camera, action, it's game time\nDo you take this here as your lovely wife?\nTo love her and cherish her for all your life?\nI solemnly swear to dare share take you there\nAnd me and you together baby we a lucky pair\nIt's been a long time, we walked a thin line\nOthers say they got you but you been mine\nAs I sit back and watch all them cat fights\nDomestic violence \u2014 is that right?\nBut you love the Dogg, gave me the spotlight\nAnd now I'm growin' up, showin' up, blowin' up\nI never ever thought that we would separate at all\nBut you played me like a game of football\nUsed to feed me, need me, dress me\nNow it's so messy straight cut out and left me\n\n[Outro: Andr\u00e9 3000 + Snoop Dogg]\nHollywood divorce\nAll the fresh styles always start off as a good little hood thing\nLook at blues, rock, jazz, rap\nNot even talkin' about music\nEverything else too\nBy the time it reach Hollywood it's over\nBut it's cool\nWe just keep it goin' and make new shit\nTake our game, take our name\nGive us a little fame\nAnd then they kick us to the curb that's a cold thang"}}, {"title": "GhettoMusick",

down\nYour battleship is sunk, I wish Grandma could see us\n\n[Chorus: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nFind a way to get out, without a hit out\nYou dig in, you dig out, you get out\nGhetto Musick, Ghetto Musick\nFind a way to get in, to fit in\nYou get on, you get out, without a doubt\nGhetto Musick, Ghetto Musick\n\n[Bridge: Big Boi & Patti LaBelle]\nI just want you to know how I feel\nFeeling good, feeling great\nHow I feel\nFeeling great, feeling good, how are you, you?\nI just want you to know how I feel\nFeeling good, feeling great\nHow I feel\nFeeling great, feeling good, how are you?\n\n[Verse 1: Big Boi]\nHot tub, bad to the bony, I'm Tony\nAs my Grandmama Edna Mae Kearse, she showed me\nHow to be the smooth operator, dominator\nIn the state of Georgia, hip hop standard destroyer\nLeave a muthafucka open like a foyer\nHe from the dirty,, now here come the paranoia\nA lawyer couldn't object or disrespect the technique\nSweat me, wipe off the sweat\nFight off the shit and flush the waste down\nThe pipes of my life flow deep into the ground\nFind my purpose on the surface of this Earth, this\nPlanet's standards trust and the purpose\nCampaign in vain for the same lame fame\nYou've obtained, you ought to be detained\nBy the hip hop sheriff, locked up, no possibility\nOf getting out because the shit you make is killing me\nAnd my ears, and my peers\nI hear the end is near, no fear, we disappear\nThen reappear again in a fresh new light\nI hope it's peaceful and cloudy\n'Cause if it's not, we gotta fight like\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nG-H-E-T-T-O M-U-S-I-C-K, stay down\nO-U-T-K-A-S-T, just know that we won't play 'round\nIf it don't stank like they stank, then they can't swallow that down\nYour battleship is sunk, I wish Grandma could see us\n\n[Chorus: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nFind a way to get out, without a hit out\nYou dig in, you dig out, you get out\nGhetto Musick, Ghetto Musick\nFind a way to get in, to fit in\nYou get on, you get out without a doubt\nGhetto Musick, Ghetto Musick\n\n[Bridge: Big Boi & Patti LaBelle]\nI just want you to know how I feel\nFeeling good, feeling great\nHow I feel\nFeeling great, feeling good, how are you, you?\nI just want you to know how I feel\nFeeling good, feeling great\nHow I feel\nFeeling great, feeling good, how are you?", "image":

3000]\nClimbing out this hole (Climbing out this hole)\nWith a frown on my face\n(In the place to be) In the place to be\nAnd not to be at the same time\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nG-H-E-T-T-O M-U-S-I-C-K, stay down\nO-U-T-K-A-S-T, just know that we won't play 'round\nIf it don't stank like they stank, then they can't swallow that down\nYour battleship is sunk, I wish Grandma could see us\n\n[Chorus: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nFind a way to get out, without a hit out\nYou dig in, you dig out, you get out\nGhetto Musick, Ghetto Musick\nFind a way to get in, to fit in\nYou get on, you get out, without a doubt\nGhetto Musick, Ghetto Musick\n\n[Bridge: Big Boi & Patti LaBelle]\nI just want you to know how I feel\nFeeling good, feeling great\nHow I feel\nFeeling great, feeling good, how are you, you?\nI just want you to know how I feel\nFeeling good, feeling great\nHow I feel\nFeeling great, feeling good, how are you?\n\n[Verse 1: Big Boi]\nHot tub, bad to the bony, I'm Tony\nAs my Grandmama Edna Mae Kearse, she showed me\nHow to be the smooth operator, dominator\nIn the state of Georgia, hip hop standard destroyer\nLeave a muthafucka open like a foyer\nHe from the dirty,, now here come the paranoia\nA lawyer couldn't object or disrespect the technique\nSweat me, wipe off the sweat\nFight off the shit and flush the waste down\nThe pipes of my life flow deep into the ground\nFind my purpose on the surface of this Earth, this\nPlanet's standards trust and the purpose\nCampaign in vain for the same lame fame\nYou've obtained, you ought to be detained\nBy the hip hop sheriff, locked up, no possibility\nOf getting out because the shit you make is killing me\nAnd my ears, and my peers\nI hear the end is near, no fear, we disappear\nThen reappear again in a fresh new light\nI hope it's peaceful and cloudy\n'Cause if it's not, we gotta fight like\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nG-H-E-T-T-O M-U-S-I-C-K, stay down\nO-U-T-K-A-S-T, just know that we won't play 'round\nIf it don't stank like they stank, then they can't swallow that down\nYour battleship is sunk, I wish Grandma could see us\n\n[Chorus: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nFind a way to get out, without a hit out\nYou dig in, you dig out, you get out\nGhetto Musick, Ghetto Musick\nFind a way to get in, to fit in\nYou get on, you get out without a doubt\nGhetto Musick, Ghetto Musick\n\n[Bridge: Big Boi & Patti LaBelle]\nI just want you to know how I feel\nFeeling good, feeling great\nHow I feel\nFeeling great, feeling good, how are you, you?\nI just want you to know how I feel\nFeeling good, feeling great\nHow I feel\nFeeling great, feeling good, how are you?"}}, {"title": "Gasoline Dreams", "album": "Stankonia", "year": "2000-10-31", "lyrics": "[Intro: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nAlright, alright,

never made no sense to me one day I hope it will\nAnd that's that, sport, sport\nPray I live to see the day when Seven's happily married with kids\nWoe woe, the world is moving fast and I'm losing my

acknowledge us as their kin folk\nStill eatin' pork\nAbomination desecration for beating flesh\nPenalty for violation is death\nWoe, woe, to the man that strive with his maker on Judgement Day\nHip Hip Hooray!\nMr. Reaper Babylon the great\nThe mother of harlots is falling, prophecy must be fulfilled\nThe lake of fire is calling\n\n[Hook: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nDon't everybody like the smell of

alright, alright\nAlright, alright, alright, alright\nAlright, alright, alright, alright\n\n[Hook: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nDon't everybody like the smell of gasoline?\nWell burn muthafucka burn American dreams\nDon't everybody like the taste of apple pie?\nWe'll snap for yo' slice of life I'm tellin' ya why\nI hear that Mother Nature now's on birth control\nThe coldest pimp be looking for somebody to hold\nThe highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll\nYouth full of fire ain't got nowhere to go, nowhere to go\n\n[Verse 1: Andre 3000]\nAll of my heroes did dope\nEvery nigga 'round me playing married, or paying child support\nI can't cope, never made no sense to me one day I hope it will\nAnd that's that, sport, sport\nPray I live to see the day when Seven's happily married with kids\nWoe woe, the world is moving fast and I'm losing my balance\nNow time to dig, low low\nTo a place where ain't nowhere to go but up\nYou with me say shit, sho sho\nNow let me ask y'all this\n\n[Hook: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nDon't everybody like the smell of gasoline?\nWell burn muthafucka burn American dreams\nDon't everybody like the taste of apple pie?\nWe'll snap for yo' slice of life I'm tellin' ya why\nI hear that Mother Nature now's on birth control\nThe coldest pimp be looking for somebody to hold\nThe highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll\nYouth full of fire ain't got nowhere to go, nowhere to go\n\n[Verse 2: Big Boi]\nIt's shitty like Ricky Stratton got a million bucks\nMy cousin Ricky Walker got ten years doing Fed time\nOn a first offense drug bust, fuck the Holice\nThat's if ya racist or ya crooked\nArrest me for this dope I didn't weight it up or cook it\nYou gotta charge the world cause over a million people took it\nLook at me, I'm outta your jurisdiction now ya lookin' stupid\nOfficer, get off me sir\nDon't make me call L.A. he'll have ya walking sir\nA couple of months ago they gave OutKast the key to the city\nBut I still gotta pay my taxes and they give us no pity\nAbout these youngsters amongst us\nYou think they respect the law\nThey think they monsters, they love us, reality rappin'\nAnd giving the youth the truth from this booth\nAnd when we on stage we scream\nDon't everybody, everybody\n\n[Hook: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nDon't everybody like the smell of gasoline?\nWell burn muthafucka burn American dreams\nDon't everybody like the taste of apple pie?\nWe'll snap for yo' slice of life I'm tellin' ya why\nI hear that Mother Nature now's on birth control\nThe coldest pimp be looking for somebody to hold\nThe highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll\nYouth full of fire ain't got nowhere to go, nowhere to go\n\n[Verse 3: Khujo]\nOfficer of the most high\nYou touch me you touch the apple of his eye\nIf they kick us out, where will we go?\nNot to Africa cause not one of them acknowledge us as their kin folk\nStill eatin' pork\nAbomination desecration for beating flesh\nPenalty for violation is death\nWoe, woe, to the man that strive with his maker on Judgement Day\nHip Hip Hooray!\nMr. Reaper Babylon the great\nThe mother of harlots is falling, prophecy must be fulfilled\nThe lake of fire is calling\n\n[Hook: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nDon't everybody like the smell of gasoline?\nWell burn muthafucka burn American dreams\nDon't everybody like the taste of apple pie?\nWe'll snap for yo' slice of life I'm tellin' ya why\nI hear that Mother Nature now's on birth control\nThe coldest pimp be looking for somebody to hold\nThe highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll\nYouth full of fire ain't got nowhere to go, nowhere to

your brain, check it out\n\n[Verse 1: Big Boi + Andr\u00e9 3000]\nOnce upon a time not long ago\nWhen the playa from the Point didn't have no flow\nA nigga hit me for my tennis shoes, walking to the store\nCaught a nigga slipping, but now I lay it to the flo'\nJust like carpet, 'cause I got the heat in my baby\nMomma name now, never bragging just to stay knot\nEven when I was a younger lad, I learned my lesson;\nNever talked to strangers in the trap and answer questions\nThe Pope and his folks got us under a scope\nBut for unknown reasons cause we don't sell dope\nThat you distribute, we don't contribute to your clandestine\nActivity, my soliloquy may be hard for some to swallow\nBut so is cod liver oil\nYou went behind my back like Bluto when he cut up Olive Oyl\nTwo things I hate\u2014liars and thieves; they make my blood boil\nBoa constricted, on my soul that they coil\n\n[Hook: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nTouched by the wheelz of steel\nNow, show me how you feel\n\nTouched by the wheelz of steel\nNow, show me how you feel\n\n[Verse 2: Big Boi + Andr\u00e9 3000]\nIt took your momma nine months to make it\nBut it only took a nigga thirty minutes to take it\nCut that kronk clean up, I did, but I did so not safely\nDon't want no AIDS, *clapping* no claps, or no rabies\nYeah, we take no shit, like, ummm, stopped up commodes\nGotta collect call, they done locked up my folks\nLow blow, hit me in the left ventricle\nWe won't be able to ride out till two thousand four\nBut not for long 'cause we got a better sack to serve\nTryna take you other people 'fore your rims at the curb\n'Fore you swerve and bust ya forehead, go 'head, go 'head\nMore head for me, while you ride to the beat\nDrop, like tears, like For Fears, you know\nShout, shout, let it all out, just for my peers\nAnd peoples who feel it's time to unwind\nLike December 31st, on nineteen-ninety-nine\n\n[Hook: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nTouched by the wheelz of steel\nNow, show me how you feel\n\nTouched by the wheelz of steel\nNow, show me how you feel\n\n\n[Bridge: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nOkay, like this, yes, yes\nOne time for my boys doing King shit\nTwo times, too legit and it don't quit\nThree times for my folks in the drop top\nFour times, OutKast and it don't stop\nOne time for my girls doing Queen thangs\nDead fresh to the T, eating chicken wings\nThree times for my girls in the beauty shop\nFour times, OutKast and it don't stop\n\n[Interlude]\n\n[Hook: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nTouched by the wheelz of steel\nNow, show me how you feel\n\nTouched by the wheelz of steel...", "image":

sweatpants\nI finna enhance your brain, check it out\n\n[Verse 1: Big Boi + Andr\u00e9 3000]\nOnce upon a time not long ago\nWhen the playa from the Point didn't have no flow\nA nigga hit me for my tennis shoes, walking to the store\nCaught a nigga slipping, but now I lay it to the flo'\nJust like carpet, 'cause I got the heat in my baby\nMomma name now, never bragging just to stay knot\nEven when I was a younger lad, I learned my lesson;\nNever talked to strangers in the trap and answer questions\nThe Pope and his folks got us under a scope\nBut for unknown reasons cause we don't sell dope\nThat you distribute, we don't contribute to your clandestine\nActivity, my soliloquy may be hard for some to swallow\nBut so is cod liver oil\nYou went behind my back like Bluto when he cut up Olive Oyl\nTwo things I hate\u2014liars and thieves; they make my blood boil\nBoa constricted, on my soul that they coil\n\n[Hook: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nTouched by the wheelz of steel\nNow, show me how you feel\n\nTouched by the wheelz of steel\nNow, show me how you feel\n\n[Verse 2: Big Boi + Andr\u00e9 3000]\nIt took your momma nine months to make it\nBut it only took a nigga thirty minutes to take it\nCut that kronk clean up, I did, but I did so not safely\nDon't want no AIDS, *clapping* no claps, or no rabies\nYeah, we take no shit, like, ummm, stopped up commodes\nGotta collect call, they done locked up my folks\nLow blow, hit me in the left ventricle\nWe won't be able to ride out till two thousand four\nBut not for long 'cause we got a better sack to serve\nTryna take you other people 'fore your rims at the curb\n'Fore you swerve and bust ya forehead, go 'head, go 'head\nMore head for me, while you ride to the beat\nDrop, like tears, like For Fears, you know\nShout, shout, let it all out, just for my peers\nAnd peoples who feel it's time to unwind\nLike December 31st, on nineteen-ninety-nine\n\n[Hook: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nTouched by the wheelz of steel\nNow, show me how you feel\n\nTouched by the wheelz of steel\nNow, show me how you feel\n\n\n[Bridge: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nOkay, like this, yes, yes\nOne time for my boys doing King shit\nTwo times, too legit and it don't quit\nThree times for my folks in the drop top\nFour times, OutKast and it don't stop\nOne time for my girls doing Queen thangs\nDead fresh to the T, eating chicken wings\nThree times for my girls in the beauty shop\nFour times, OutKast and it don't stop\n\n[Interlude]\n\n[Hook: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nTouched by the wheelz of steel\nNow, show me how you feel\n\nTouched by the wheelz of steel..."}},

a blizzard\nI'm so cold I'm tryin' to hold ya\nLife is like a great big roller coaster\nEverything in life don't happen like it's suppose to\nTrials and tribulations make you stronger live longer\nYou wanna reach the nation nigga start from ya corner\nEverything don't always happen like you plan it\nDemand it; over stand it then you handle it\nFuck wishing you, you missing the ambition on your mission\nNow you switching why you quitting cause it's heated in the kitchen\nSloppy slipping in your pimping nigga\nYou either pistol whoop the nigga or you choke the trigger\nYou've got to follow

her draws\nShe said she thought Hip Hop was only guns and alcohol\nI said \"Oh hell naw!\", but yet it's that too\nYou can't discrima-hate cause you done read a book or two\nWhat if I looked at you in a microscope saw all the dirty organisms\nLiving in your closet would I stop and would I pause it\nTo put that bitch in slower motion, got the potion and the antidote\nAnd a quote for collision the

I'm free just like the wind the breeze that blows\nAnd I flow just like a brook, a stream, the rain\nAnd I fly just like a bird up in the sky\nAnd I'll surely die just like a flower plucked\nAnd dragged away and thrown away\nAnd then one day, it turns to clay\nIt blows away, it finds a ray, it finds its way\nAnd there it lays, until the rain and sun\nThen I breathe\nJust like the wind the breeze that blows\nAnd I grow just like a baby blossoming\nAnd it's beautiful\nThat's life, that's life\nThat's life, that's life\n\n[Hook: Andr\u00e9 3000 + Erykah Badu]\nHumble as a mumble in the

"[Intro: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nAh, I stank I can, I stank I can\nThe funky engine that could\nOoh, ooh, yosky, wosky, pisky, wisky\nAll aboard the Stankonia Express\nThe underground smell road\nEverybody's lookin' for an excuse to let loose\nWhat's your locomotive, the Chatta-nigga choo choo?\n\n[Hook: Andr\u00e9 3000 + Erykah Badu]\nHumble as a mumble in the jungles\nOf shouts and screams\nThat's the way the cracker crumbles\nSo I guess I've got to re-route my dreams\nHumble as a mumble in the jungles\nOf shouts and screams\nThat's the way the cracker crumbles\nSo I guess I've got to re-route my dreams\n\n[Verse 1: Big Boi]\nBack on the microphone, your number one controller\nI rock the microphone like a blizzard\nI'm so cold I'm tryin' to hold ya\nLife is like a great big roller coaster\nEverything in life don't happen like it's suppose to\nTrials and tribulations make you stronger live longer\nYou wanna reach the nation nigga start from ya corner\nEverything don't always happen like you plan it\nDemand it; over stand it then you handle it\nFuck wishing you, you missing the ambition on your mission\nNow you switching why you quitting cause it's heated in the kitchen\nSloppy slipping in your pimping nigga\nYou either pistol whoop the nigga or you choke the trigger\nYou've got to follow through, struggle to complete your dreams\n\"No Weapon Formed Against You Prospers\" 54:17\nFrom Isaiah, lay a, nigga down and spray 'em\nIf the dealer dealt a fucked up hand of cards you've gotta play 'em\n\n[Hook: Andr\u00e9 3000 + Erykah Badu]\nHumble as a mumble in the jungles\nOf shouts and screams\nThat's the way the cracker crumbles\nSo I guess I've got to re-route my dreams\nHumble as a mumble in the jungles\nOf shouts and screams\nThat's the way the cracker crumbles\nSo I guess I've got to re-route my dreams\n\n[Verse 2: Andre 3000]\nYeah, too Democratic, Republic fuck it\nWe chicken nugget, we dip in the sauce like mop and bucket\nBlue-collar scholars, who'll take your dolla, and wipe my ass with it\nYou living for the lotto never hit it\nI met a critic, I made her shit her draws\nShe said she thought Hip Hop was only guns and alcohol\nI said \"Oh hell naw!\", but yet it's that too\nYou can't discrima-hate cause you done read a book or two\nWhat if I looked at you in a microscope saw all the dirty organisms\nLiving in your closet would I stop and would I pause it\nTo put that bitch in slower motion, got the potion and the antidote\nAnd a quote for collision the decision\nDo you want to live or wanna exist?\nThe game changes everyday, so obsolete is the fist and marches\nSpeeches only reaches those who already know about it\nThis is how we go about it\n\n[Hook: Andr\u00e9 3000 + Erykah Badu]\nHumble as a mumble in the jungles\nOf shouts and screams\nThat's the way the cracker crumbles\nSo I guess I've got to re-route my dreams\nHumble as a mumble in the jungles\nOf shouts and screams\nThat's the way the cracker crumbles\nSo I guess I've got to re-route my dreams\n\n[Verse 3: Erykah Badu]\nI'm wild just like a rock, a stone, a tree\nAnd I'm free just like the wind the breeze that blows\nAnd I flow just like a brook, a stream, the rain\nAnd I fly just like a bird up in the sky\nAnd I'll surely die just like a flower plucked\nAnd dragged away and thrown away\nAnd then one day, it turns to clay\nIt blows away, it finds a ray, it finds its way\nAnd there it lays, until the rain and sun\nThen I breathe\nJust like the wind the breeze that blows\nAnd I grow just like a baby blossoming\nAnd it's beautiful\nThat's life, that's life\nThat's life, that's life\n\n[Hook: Andr\u00e9 3000 + Erykah Badu]\nHumble as a mumble in the jungles\nOf shouts and screams\nThat's the way the cracker crumbles\nSo I guess I've got to re-route my dreams\nHumble as a mumble in the jungles\nOf shouts and screams\nThat's the way the cracker crumbles\nSo I guess I've got to re-route my dreams\n\n[Outro: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nHumble as a mumble in the jungles\nOf shouts and screams\nThat's the way the cracker crumbles\nSo I guess I've gotta re-route my dreams\nY'all can't harm me, it's over"}}, {"title": "Vibrate", "album":

1]\nSometimes when it's late at, when it's late at night\nAnd you have no one to talk to\nHere's what you do\nYou go through that raggedy cell phone 'bout two or three times\nTracy ain't home, Tina ain't home\nThe Love Below starts talkin' to ya\n\n[Chorus]\nEvery boy and girl, woman to man\nWhen you feel you've done about the best you can\nMotherfuck the wagon, come join the band\nVibrate,

already begun\nDesensitizing the very thing or thang\nThat brought you into this motherfucker in the first place\nAnd when I say \"motherfucker\", I do mean \"motherfucker\"\nBecause Mother Earth is dying\nAnd we continue to fuck her to death\nPlay with your own score sheet\nBecome the master of your own 'bation\nAnd yes, God is watching you\nBut no need to be embarrassed\nFor the future is in your hands\nNo, the future is in your hand\nPlay with your own score sheet\n\n[Chorus]\nEvery boy and girl, woman to man\nWhen you feel you've done about the best you can\nMotherfuck the wagon, come

from me at 23\nMaking it free in my community\nOne day is what I live for\nAin't thinking about no hope no more\nI got my boots I kick it 'til I get with\nAdapt and overcome, oh hum hum\nGo get my gun, load up for fun, and put down with the frown\nWhat goes round comes round from M.L.K. to Cascade\nI know it's through them plenty figures\nCocaine dealers walk the wrong side\nUp in they rides\nLooking cleaner then I seen them the last time\nThen selling dimes, now its quarter ki's, stacking G's\nIn the South Indies\nMy nigga them folks riding bicycles among vehicles\nOff in the hood\nKnowing each and every nigga selling, but can you blame\nThe fact the only way a brother can survive the game\nThe block hard to get by the dope dealing\nFatal killings, and fed time, to writing rhymes\nIt ain't just the police\nWe kill each other just lost another brother\nFast living will get you took\nThinking it can't happen to you and then it do\nOff crooked schemes it's just a dream\nFloating face down in the mainstream\n\n[Hook]\nThink it is when it ain't all peaches and cream\nThat's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream\n\n[Verse 2: Andre 3000]\nThey swan diving\nAs if they name be Gretchen von Ivan\nVolkoff rushin' to finish their album then you find them\nLost, dog paddling, backstroking, what done happened?\nBe rhyming \"catch of the day\" when the recipe calls for \"blackened\"\nWrong ingredients\nMaybe too much herbs and spices\nMaybe you got hungry for the wrong dish\nOf them greens and it's enticing how them Jones's sing\nSo I'm gonna sing just like them to get where they at\nI'll even break my by back to touch their rim, if I gotta\nMy alta mater be that I follow\nI bite whatever that's looking tasty, water it down then swallow\nI hope you vomit, won't call no names cause that's not my job\nIt just applies to whom it may concern, you know who you are\nBut if you don't you never will, you just receive the steel\nBut then it might get ugly 'cause trust me niggas do feel\nThe way that I felt when I wrote this, but we must stay in focus\nWe kings and queens up in this thing, get rid of all them jokers\nFace down, face down, face down\n\n[Hook]\nThink it is when it ain't all peaches and cream\nThat's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream\n\n[Verse 3: Khujo Goodie]\nI let you stay in my crib\nNow you know where I live\nWhen you was hungry, fed you a hot meal\nLook at the hand you deal\nMe crudball business, niggas giving inches, so here, take a foot\nLuck only counts in rabbit's feet and horseshoes\nExperience is sometimes the best teacher until we get our own plate\nI hope you don't mind me eating off of yours\nProcess sm-m-moking like Jerry\nMeanwhile, fairies up the street sprinkling pixie dust over greenery\nNever to attain another level of conscience\nOnly to test, the potency\nWhy laying here, they scheme over one another mouth to feed\nDeceased with a decision to make, now words shake your destiny\nBut one miss will take it all the way, just as quick as you can say\n\"I wish I never did what I did\", now face this bid\nIt was the company you kept, the many places you slept\nWhen you shouldn't have, geeking like a rat, jumping like a trap\nContributing to sin and your nigga bitch in the club showing pink for 10\nThey got you niggas where they want you again\nFloating face down in the mainstream\nThat's why, that's why, that's why\n\n[Hook]\nThink it is when it ain't all peaches and cream\nThat's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream\n\n[Verse 4: Big Boi]\nEverybody's a player, wearing them Kangols on their head\nThinking it's all about your clothes, nigga, it's all about your self\nThe way you feel about your life, the times that you done shared with\nYour friends and family, up and down like hoes give head\nTo dicks oh, six, serving them in the mix, but ain't no mystery\nYou know the history about this clique, bitch\nOh, what, you want me to call you slut?\nThen why you fucking all them niggas letting them all up in your guts\nBut see that AIDS I'm afraid that's why I play the quiet role\nI lay in the cut, every month thinking I'll let that fire roll\nLike chimneys, and smoke signals, maybe peace pipes even\nMy partners call me Big Boi and my first name is not Steven\nIn the mainstream, home team banging them with these hits\nIn the mix, flowing like some motherfucking swordfish\n\n[Hook]\nThink it is when it ain't all peaches and cream\nThat's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream\nThink it is when it ain't all peaches and cream\nThat's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream\nThink it is when it ain't all peaches and cream\nThat's why some are found

"lyrics": "[Verse 1: T-Mo Goodie]\nRevolutionary, scary\nThought provoking, spoken\nWords of a change I don't feel but I see\nVisions from me at 23\nMaking it free in my community\nOne day is what I live for\nAin't thinking about no hope no more\nI got my boots I kick it 'til I get with\nAdapt and overcome, oh hum hum\nGo get my gun, load up for fun, and put down with the frown\nWhat goes round comes round from M.L.K. to Cascade\nI know it's through them plenty figures\nCocaine dealers walk the wrong side\nUp in they rides\nLooking cleaner then I seen them the last time\nThen selling dimes, now its quarter ki's, stacking G's\nIn the South Indies\nMy nigga them folks riding bicycles among vehicles\nOff in the hood\nKnowing each and every nigga selling, but can you blame\nThe fact the only way a brother can survive the game\nThe block hard to get by the dope dealing\nFatal killings, and fed time, to writing rhymes\nIt ain't just the police\nWe kill each other just lost another brother\nFast living will get you took\nThinking it can't happen to you and then it do\nOff crooked schemes it's just a dream\nFloating face down in the mainstream\n\n[Hook]\nThink it is when it ain't all peaches and cream\nThat's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream\n\n[Verse 2: Andre 3000]\nThey swan diving\nAs if they name be Gretchen von Ivan\nVolkoff rushin' to finish their album then you find them\nLost, dog paddling, backstroking, what done happened?\nBe rhyming \"catch of the day\" when the recipe calls for \"blackened\"\nWrong ingredients\nMaybe too much herbs and spices\nMaybe you got hungry for the wrong dish\nOf them greens and it's enticing how them Jones's sing\nSo I'm gonna sing just like them to get where they at\nI'll even break my by back to touch their rim, if I gotta\nMy alta mater be that I follow\nI bite whatever that's looking tasty, water it down then swallow\nI hope you vomit, won't call no names cause that's not my job\nIt just applies to whom it may concern, you know who you are\nBut if you don't you never will, you just receive the steel\nBut then it might get ugly 'cause trust me niggas do feel\nThe way that I felt when I wrote this, but we must stay in focus\nWe kings and queens up in this thing, get rid of all them jokers\nFace down, face down, face down\n\n[Hook]\nThink it is when it ain't all peaches and cream\nThat's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream\n\n[Verse 3: Khujo Goodie]\nI let you stay in my crib\nNow you know where I live\nWhen you was hungry, fed you a hot meal\nLook at the hand you deal\nMe crudball business, niggas giving inches, so here, take a foot\nLuck only counts in rabbit's feet and horseshoes\nExperience is sometimes the best teacher until we get our own plate\nI hope you don't mind me eating off of yours\nProcess sm-m-moking like Jerry\nMeanwhile, fairies up the street sprinkling pixie dust over greenery\nNever to attain another level of conscience\nOnly to test, the potency\nWhy laying here, they scheme over one another mouth to feed\nDeceased with a decision to make, now words shake your destiny\nBut one miss will take it all the way, just as quick as you can say\n\"I wish I never did what I did\", now face this bid\nIt was the company you kept, the many places you slept\nWhen you shouldn't have, geeking like a rat, jumping like a trap\nContributing to sin and your nigga bitch in the club showing pink for 10\nThey got you niggas where they want you again\nFloating face down in the mainstream\nThat's why, that's why, that's why\n\n[Hook]\nThink it is when it ain't all peaches and cream\nThat's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream\n\n[Verse 4: Big Boi]\nEverybody's a player, wearing them Kangols on their head\nThinking it's all about your clothes, nigga, it's all about your self\nThe way you feel about your life, the times that you done shared with\nYour friends and family, up and down like hoes give head\nTo dicks oh, six, serving them in the mix, but ain't no mystery\nYou know the history about this clique, bitch\nOh, what, you want me to call you slut?\nThen why you fucking all them niggas letting them all up in your guts\nBut see that AIDS I'm afraid that's why I play the quiet role\nI lay in the cut, every month thinking I'll let that fire roll\nLike chimneys, and smoke signals, maybe peace pipes even\nMy partners call me Big Boi and my first name is not Steven\nIn the mainstream, home team banging them with these hits\nIn the mix, flowing like some motherfucking swordfish\n\n[Hook]\nThink it is when it ain't all peaches and cream\nThat's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream\nThink it is when it ain't all peaches and cream\nThat's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream\nThink it is when it ain't all peaches and cream\nThat's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream\nThink it is when it ain't all peaches and cream\nThat's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream"}}, {"title": "Slum Beautiful", "album": "Stankonia", "year": "2000-10-31", "lyrics": "[Hook]\nSlum beautiful, driving I plum crazy\nSlum beautiful, soul, but so

"[Hook]\nSlum beautiful, driving I plum crazy\nSlum beautiful, soul, but so amazing\n\n[Andre 3000]\nThey don't know, but I do though\nBaby my darling you make me lose composure\nFragments of a million me\nScattered across the floor to a certain degree\nWhere I had to give your mama call\nAnd thank her for spending time with your daddy\nFor all its worth, girl what's your frequency\nAnd can I come there frequently\n\n(Hook)\n\n[Big Boi]\nLucius Left Foot\nWhat I like to do most is spit this game like sports announcers\nAnd will pity pat them hoez down like a gentlemen club bouncer\nOunce of killa dilla, be making my game more flagrant\nAnd once I done had some Cuervo 'bout six shots I'm nothin to play wit\nLike plug sockets and babies, possums, raccoons, and rabies\nMaybe Lady Luscious oba kaybee so they say thee\nAn old school playa pimp type ass nigga like Tony Mercedes\nAnd will work every last muscle off in your body like Billy Blanky\nHanky panky, where did you get your gold grill cause it's banging\nAnd I like them red hot Fila straight from Walters off the chain\nFuck them bouige bitches they don't know nothin 'bout you\nCause you push a big black Buick, so fresh, so clean on them Trues\nSlum beautiful you's the would to me, shawty I dig ya\nAnd I'm loving the way them Jordache got a bear hug on your figure\nYou my nigga, nigga\n\n(Hook)\n\n[Cee-Lo Goodie]\nLook at you, unbelievably, brilliant beautiful you\nYou're looking deliciously divine darling you really and truly do\nThe very thought of has got me running at the speed of love\nExploring everything about you from the ground to the God above\nSuddenly I started dreaming, traveling in time so fast\nI could almost taste outer space\nI saw the face of God and looked like you and me too\nHello, I'm the man that God made you for\nProfound don't think, okay let's put this poetry in motion\nI'm shining simply because mother earth I'm your son\nOur entire circumference engulfed in emotion\nForever's gonna be so fun\n\n(Hook)\n\n[Andre 3000]\nI don't know but, it seem like uh, your daddy must have gave you\nA teaspoon of honey every night before you went to bed\nOr was it a pack of Now & Laters cause you're the sweetest thing on my head\nAnd I'd like to say that I'd love to make love to every molecule of you\nAnd if you want to spontaneously combust that's what we'll do in unison"}}, {"title": "We Luv Deez Hoez", "album": "Stankonia", "year": "2000-10-31", "lyrics": "[Intro: Big Boi]\nYe-yeah\nEast point in the house like this here\n\n[Hook: Big Boi]\nFrom the weave to

straight from her booty\nSo Do Re, blow me, Fa So La Ti Da Ha I'm tellin' the truth\nYou suckin' your tooth you treatin' her like a star boy\nFrom a Figueroa to a herringbone\nFrom droppin' her off to takin' her home\nShe tried to pull my rubber off with her pussy muscles that was wrong\nThe bitch is no good like lesbians with no tongues\nYou fucked around and knocked her up and now you say she the

cocaine\nYou ready to turn your 'fro, from natural straight to a cold wave\nDat ho name Betty Big Shoez, she wore them Herman Munster heels\nPopped a pill, now she's in your Coupe De Ville, passenger seat\nI made her eat my meat while I was rubbin' her coochie\nInjection in her top and bottom lip straight from her booty\nSo Do Re, blow me, Fa So La Ti Da Ha I'm tellin' the truth\nYou suckin' your tooth you treatin' her like a star boy\nFrom a Figueroa to a herringbone\nFrom droppin' her off to takin' her home\nShe tried to pull my rubber off with her pussy muscles that was wrong\nThe bitch is no good like lesbians with no tongues\nYou fucked around and knocked her up and now you say she the one\nNigga you dumb, you should have pulled it out and squirted on her eyelash\nAnd let her face be holdin' the baby, now she after yo ass!\nYeah, I told y'all niggas\nAbout god damn takin' them hoez to the Cheesecake Factory\nLettin' them hoez order strawberry lemonade and popcorn shrimps\nThey ain't goin' do nuthin'\nBut try to take all your motherfuckin' cheese! (Yeah!)\n\n[Hook: Big Boi]\nFrom the weave to the fake eyes\nTo the fake nails, down to the toes\nHa ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez\nHa ha ha ha!

We luv deez hoez\n\n[Verse 2: BackBone]\nAy, ay, what's up lil' girl I see you workin' them Valente\nShe walk wit a fly Sashay\nLook here say, I'm Mr. Fat Face I come through swervin' (ay, ay)\nYou love the way the leather grippin' your butt\nConversation kill 'em, drippin' em up\nRelax Shawty, oh lordy, I quote the facts\nWhippin' convertible with Daddy Fat Sax\nI stay G sharp as a note of music\nCall me fresh baked bread, make a broad lose it\nI'm just sayin' they just can't stand to see me execute game plan\nI slow it down, she like it - speed it up\nShe poked it out, I beat it up like that\nHit 'em from the back, had to increase that ho vocabulary\n\n[Hook: Big Boi]\nFrom the weave to the fake eyes\nTo the fake nails, down to the toes\nHa ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez\nHa ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez\nFrom the weave to the fake eyes\nTo the fake nails, down to the toes\nHa ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez\nHa ha ha ha!

moment, jumping like a pogo stick\nLife never lived up to my expectations, so I accept the patience\nExpect the worse but now I'm pacing back and forth\nInside I'm melting like water on wicked witches\nA monster truck done came and ran over my picket fences\nI had the best of life in my clenches, but monkey wrenches was thrown\nLike chairs kings sit on, my prayers seem too long\nI fall asleep before the ending, don't even get to say Amen\nI hope He understand I be on bended knees\nAt times, I think I'm crazy, then I say 'forget it'\nOr maybe it's the devil infiltrating and like Riddick...Bowe\nI've been fighting this since them fetus days\nI count from one to twenty, when I'm through, repeat the phrase\nIt's just a phase, it's gon' all pass, but that gets old too\nI'm weakening like a deacon doing dirt\nWhat am I s'posed do?\n\n[Hook: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nUh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh uh, uh uh uh uh uh (Planets and stars)\nUh uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh uh uh (Earth, Jupiter,

start some new shit\nI'm writing this rhyme in faith, so when you hear it, hope you true it\nMy nigga, you do it like swooshes, the lyrical cleanse and new sense\nWiping away your germs and filling your cranium with juices\nSee Mo goes on, my slick flow flows on\nStraight from West Savannah, Georgia, but the S.W.A.T.S. is my home\nNever go wrong cause the click is tighter than gnat ass and that bad\nMosquito, now we goes, \"I'm proud of you people\nFor selling your crack in sacks, I'm glad I'm white not Black\"\nShit, on the real, that's how them mighties really act\nWhen your back was turned, them slackers learned and now we falling apart\nYou looking me in my eye, but you ain't feeling me in your heart\nYes, yes Lord, give me the power within the final hour\nThese niggas, they leaving me stranded like Rapunzel in the tower\nNow or never, let's stick together and overcome\nBut they don't feel like marching, 'cause they shoes is overrun\nAin't that a bitch\n\n[Hook]\nUh, uh,

unstable like Chernobyl\nReady to go at any moment, jumping like a pogo stick\nLife never lived up to my expectations, so I accept the patience\nExpect the worse but now I'm pacing back and forth\nInside I'm melting like water on wicked witches\nA monster truck done came and ran over my picket fences\nI had the best of life in my clenches, but monkey wrenches was thrown\nLike chairs kings sit on, my prayers seem too long\nI fall asleep before the ending, don't even get to say Amen\nI hope He understand I be on bended knees\nAt times, I think I'm crazy, then I say 'forget it'\nOr maybe it's the devil infiltrating and like Riddick...Bowe\nI've been fighting this since them fetus days\nI count from one to twenty, when I'm through, repeat the phrase\nIt's just a phase, it's gon' all pass, but that gets old too\nI'm weakening like a deacon doing dirt\nWhat am I s'posed do?\n\n[Hook: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nUh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh uh, uh uh uh uh uh (Planets and stars)\nUh uh uh uh

bedknobs to broomsticks, we looking to start some new shit\nI'm writing this rhyme in faith, so when you hear it, hope you true it\nMy nigga, you do it like swooshes, the lyrical cleanse and new sense\nWiping away your germs and filling your cranium with juices\nSee Mo goes on, my slick flow flows on\nStraight from West Savannah, Georgia, but the S.W.A.T.S. is my home\nNever go wrong cause the click is tighter than gnat ass and that bad\nMosquito, now we goes, \"I'm proud of you people\nFor selling your crack in sacks, I'm glad I'm white not Black\"\nShit, on the real, that's how them mighties really act\nWhen your back was turned, them slackers learned and now we falling apart\nYou looking me in my eye, but you ain't feeling me in your heart\nYes, yes Lord, give me the power within the final hour\nThese niggas, they leaving me stranded like Rapunzel in the tower\nNow or never, let's stick together and overcome\nBut they don't feel like marching, 'cause they shoes is overrun\nAin't that a bitch\n\n[Hook]\nUh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh uh, uh uh uh uh uh (Planets and stars)\nUh uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh uh uh (Earth, Jupiter, Mars)\nUh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh uh, uh uh uh uh

street ever heard\nNow bitches sucking on my nouns and I'm eating their verbs\nGet full, and niggas, niggas\nPop, pop, lock, lock to the, to the beat, beat\nAs if pitbulls went out of style, made a vow to myself\nIf it's for the wealth I'll stop, well put it like this\nIt's like me selling some dope because my girlfriend wants to shop\nWrong reason, whatever the season, hey winter, spring, summer or fall\nI dont stall, slow drag wit' your brain against the wall\nYeah, nigga, naw, we lean to the side don't fall\nAll y'all fuckboys, tuck toys inside your pants\nJust to pull it out, point

harm, out of danger's way\nLet strangers play while you graduate and move on\nTrue happiness is not acquired and you won't find it for sale\nUnless you're in jail and trying to get a bail\nBondsman to go on and post that bail\nYou would be happy as hell\nYou thought you was happy until that court date came\nCouldn't abort that case\nNobody to take your place, family members at stake\nToo late to

one time when I was a child\n(Flip that smile upside down now!)\nWhen I found out that Santa Claus was nothing more than Vanilli\nIt was silly, 'cause my mom and pop, they worked for every penny\nDidn't have many but had enough to get by, enough to get fly\nOnly to start the New Year off in debt\nNow you forget your happiness came and went like mom and dad's relationship\nTake a trip, you bring potato chips, I'll bring the hot sauce!\n\n[Hook]\nMight as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done\nWhen your goose is cooked\nMight as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done\nWhen

3]\n1979, Dirty South, local lounge\n(Flip that smile upside down now!)\nI never thought that alcohol could ease the notion of the sadness\nNow what done used to be a happy home done turned into some bad shit\nGraphic, language, mild violence and the silence of the the fams\nNo members to remember but I know just who I am\nI've grown into a man and like my nigga said\nWe executed the game plan

led\nWhichever way no I'm not gay\nAnd really don't give a fuck bout what you doin\nLong as I pave the way\nFor my SouthWest GA warriors\nTo come in packs, to feed, takin what we need\nTo succeed, you know what we gon' do, on this road\nWe gon' explode, now are you ready for this territory\nMakin our life one big story to tell\nReality amongst the youth, long as, breath is in my body\nI got proof, I'm not scared\n\nIf you scared, say you scared\n\n[Verse 2: Gipp]\nWho's scared?\nIn this world I'm Gipp, in second the mutant\nThe third the Geechee, how many ways can you reach me?\nNow most be scully, went from clean to muddy\nPolished to shine, the season to rhyme\nBeen down like brown, like dirt to the ground\nBeen lookin for love, now I bubble like suds\nOthers flew sky high, while others were duds\nLive high up on the hills, to escape the floods\nSituation they change, like faces and names\nWent from cool to plain, from lame to flame\nMan down or not, man plans or plots\nGive a

Well see your time elapsed\nHave you ever thought of the meaning of the word trap?\nBaboon on your back, but what's sad is that crack\nWas introduced to Hispanic communities and blacks\nBut then it spread to white and got everyone's undivided attention\n'Cause your daughter is on it and you can't hide it\nMaybe your son tried it\nRehab too crowded\nYou scared, she scared, they scared, I said\nThey scared they scared to talk about it\nBout it, bout it, bout it, bout it, bout it\n\nIf you scared, say you scared\n\n[Verse 4: Big Boi]\nFebruary 1st, 1975's my birthdate\nThe player the B-O-I, was brought onto this Earth on Thursday\nI think see, my cap I twist it back from all the dank\nBut if you see me on the Ave, you betta believe I tote that shank\nSo what y'all thought, bruh?\nI gotta protect my name and what we fought for\nSouthernplayalistic ATLiens in your sock drawer\nNo lockjaw, we got that raw shit and all the trimmings\nEven though we got two albums, this one feel like the beginning\nThe intro, the Goodie\u2014we kinfolk\nNigga, it's fin to jump off\nBut now it's time I lay low\n'Cause I believe the track gon' cut off\nPsych, the track is bumpin' like pussies on some dykes\nSo if you scared, say you scared, 'cause everybody can die tonight\n'Cause my heart don't pump no Slushee\nYou touch my niggas you touch me\nI blow up the microphone, like Marilyn Manson\nYou can't hush me, yeah\n\n[Verse 5: Khujo]\nHeat'll make anything move\nEven Tyson, can get laid down, with this tool\nJust cause the name say Goodie, you take us for fools\nOut they rabbit ass mind, don't give me mine\nI go off like mines, blowin suckers to smithereens\nWe was never folks if we fell out over this lil' cream\nOr let some soft legs come in between our dreams\nWe live like Kings, and die like fuckin' men\nI don't care how rough you roll, we can't be shut down\nAin't no openin' up shop, we already established\nYou lap doggin', we boss hoggin\nGrown men, don't beg for attention\nKeep wishin', high heels clickin'\nPaper champions, leavin' with they feet behind\nZap em for the pumpkin, at twelve\nOn the bottom bunk, holla at me\nSix to the left, last one, can't turn over with dirt on ya\nSlain dead, devils, don't have enough to purchase my essence\nIn da head, missin ounces, zip code, eight miles\nSuckas, think I got they package\nBut they still eatin moo-moo, oink-oink\nAnd fowl-fowl-fowl-fowl.. *repeats*\n\nThe truth hurts, but you can't be scared of it\nSo remember that, OutKast, Goodie Mo-B\nStill standin for somethin while y'all fallin for nothin\nStop dyin over this lil concrete and lil paper\nWe get this shit together our power's in numbers\nYou can deny the lie but you can't deny the truth\nYou scared, you scared, say you scared!"}}, {"title": "Spread", "album": "Speakerboxxx / The Love Below", "year": "2003-09-23", "lyrics": "[Chorus 1: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nI don't want to move too fast, but\nCan't resist your sexy ass\nJust spread, spread for me\n(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)\nDon't want to come on too strong, but\nI'll play in you all day long\nJust spread, spread for me\n(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)\n\n[Verse 1: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nI, I can't read minds, but I can read yours\nI think she says that she wants to pour\nYour, your, yourself all over me\nWhat you think?

Honest me, gotta be how I roll\nFuck the rhythm, tuck the rhythm under your bosom\nYou're the prism, Shirley Chisholm\nWas the first, let's rehearse makin' a baby\nPut in your order, I want a baby daughter\nDance on the tip of my tongue\nShake the clouds until there's no more wetness in them\nTell your homegirls that you will send them\nA postcard from 3000, hard\n\n[Chorus 2: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nDon't want to make you feel strange, but\nDon't let these words be in vain\nSo spread, spread for me\n(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)\nNature knows that I want you, but\nNot unless you want me too\nSo spread, spread for me\n(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus 1: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nI don't want to move too fast, but\nCan't resist your sexy ass\nJust spread, spread for me\n(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)\nDon't want to come on too strong, but\nI'll play in you all day long\nJust spread, spread for me\n(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)\n\n[Chorus 2: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nDon't want to make you feel strange, but\nDon't let these words be in vain\nSo spread, spread for me\n(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)\nNature knows that I want you, but\nNot unless you want me too\nSo spread, spread for me\n(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)\n\n[Outro: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nThe morning after..."}}, {"title": "You May Die (Intro)", "album": "ATLiens", "year": "1996-08-27", "lyrics": "Nada de novo vem do sol\nTudo de novo vem do nosso senhor\nA vida \u00e9 uma continua\u00e7\u00e3o\nO nosso senhor \u00e9 que d\u00e1 a nossa vida, \u00e1men\n\nYou can be sure\nSome go low to get high\nYou may hurt till you cry\nYou may die (You may die)\nKeep on trying (Keep on trying)\nTill it's summer, in the city\nTill it's summer, in the city", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d293509eb8c5aea6fb76de18a66c6b24.999x999x1.jpg", "artist": "OutKast", "raw": {"annotation_count": 4, "api_path": "/songs/36237", "apple_music_id": "263570539", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/36237/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "Intro to OutKast\u2019s 1996 album ATLiens.

"[Verse 1: Cool Breeze]\nI call the crib they say \"Breeze, you ain't know?\"\nI say \"What?\" \"Big Time got popped in his Benzo!\"\nI said \"Damn man, I'm riding in his Lexus\nI'm 'bout to dump this nigga's shit in New Dimensions\nGet to the crib so I can call Big Slate up\nAnd tell 'em the money man done slipped and got his throat cut\nAnd everything that we took from the warehouse\nI heard somebody talkin' 'bout it at the White House\nMan I thought you said that this job was for me and you\nI ain't know that Bill Clampett wanted some too\nYou tell his folks that I'm sorry 'bout that Lexus\nI'm 'bout to dip and see my sister up in...naaah!\nCan't even tell you where I put my extra playa card\n'Cause them Red Dog police know we homeboys\nJust tell everybody who owe us a dime\nIt's the 'great ho 'round up yo' money' time\nI got to have mine, then I'm outta here!\nTake a loss, come back up just like Coco Grier\nAin't got to worry 'bout yo' partner getting caught like a lame\nIt won't be over til' that big girl from Decatur sang\"\n(It won't be over till that big girl from Decatur sang!\nEast Point police don't know a damn thang...)\n\n[Verse 2: Big Boi]\nYeah, it won't be over, check this out\nCan you see what I be hearing talking to spirits when I sleep?\nPeep this out real quick Slick, we gets on this beat and speak\nAbout that pimp shit, that walk with dat limp shit, that hemp shit\nLooking up in your face, I see a coward and a dimwit\nLooking to run up in my private home just like you was the folks\nServing a warrant to a baby daddy, who didn't come to court\nOn a Tuesday, April Fool's Day, don't get caught slipping\nLeaving the keys off in the ignition, making me guilty by suspicion\nPenny pinchers trying to stack for ninety-six\nBuying another Fleetwood, Diamond took it, so know we's in the mix\nI need to take my ass to the crib and drop the baby off\n'Cause them niggas at the corner sto' been looking at me for too long\nStaring like accidents on highways, high days are better than sober ones\nDon't be biased, but I know it has to come\nSo I put two in the sky to let them know I'm babysittin'\nY'all don't know nothin' 'bout Big Boi, 'cause that nigga steady dipping\nIt ain't over (why that? why that?) 'til the bitch open her mouth up\nAnd sang\n\n[Verse 3: Big Gipp]\nTook me a long time to get here\nLong time man\nI'm talking about, years, and years\nRiding past funeral fields holding bodies of my peers\nIf you don't educate yourself\nNow how the fuck you gonna understand how you supposed to get paid?\nNiggas walk around get with shade tree ass ways\nFuck a fade, let my hair drag\nBack and forth like a see-saw\nJumping Lily, to lilypad dag\nLooking to get my Goodie feel\nI'm broke in like some old men\nWho'd stop dem or would stop\nI'm dropping lines for the big plot\nSixteen is when I started this dream\nIt's ninety-six I'm in your face\nCan you hear that bitch scream?\n\n(It won't be over til that big girl from Decatur sang...)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d293509eb8c5aea6fb76de18a66c6b24.999x999x1.jpg", "artist": "OutKast", "raw": {"annotation_count": 27, "api_path": "/songs/36232", "apple_music_id": "263570690", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/36232/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "In this track off of ATLiens, the duo dedicates their version of a Biblical psalm to the ATL neighborhood of Decatur.

you ain't know?\"\nI say \"What?\" \"Big Time got popped in his Benzo!\"\nI said \"Damn man, I'm riding in his Lexus\nI'm 'bout to dump this nigga's shit in New Dimensions\nGet to the crib so I can call Big Slate up\nAnd tell 'em the money man done slipped and got his throat cut\nAnd everything that we took from the warehouse\nI heard somebody talkin' 'bout it at the White House\nMan I thought you said that this job was for me and you\nI ain't know that Bill Clampett wanted some too\nYou tell his folks that I'm sorry 'bout that Lexus\nI'm 'bout to dip and see my sister up in...naaah!\nCan't even tell you where I put my extra playa card\n'Cause them Red Dog police know we homeboys\nJust tell everybody who owe us a dime\nIt's the 'great ho 'round up yo' money' time\nI got to have mine, then I'm outta here!\nTake a loss, come back up just like Coco Grier\nAin't got to worry 'bout yo' partner getting caught like a lame\nIt won't be over til' that big girl from Decatur sang\"\n(It won't be over till that big girl from Decatur sang!\nEast Point police don't know a damn thang...)\n\n[Verse 2: Big Boi]\nYeah, it won't be over, check this out\nCan you see what I be hearing talking to spirits when I sleep?\nPeep this out real quick Slick, we gets on this beat and speak\nAbout that pimp shit, that walk with dat limp shit, that hemp shit\nLooking up in your face, I see a coward and a dimwit\nLooking to run up in my private home just like you was the folks\nServing a warrant to a baby daddy, who didn't come to court\nOn a Tuesday, April Fool's Day, don't get caught slipping\nLeaving the keys off in the ignition, making me guilty by suspicion\nPenny pinchers trying to stack for ninety-six\nBuying another Fleetwood, Diamond took it, so know we's in the mix\nI need to take my ass to the crib and drop the baby off\n'Cause them niggas at the corner sto' been looking at me for too long\nStaring like accidents on highways, high days are better than sober ones\nDon't be biased, but I know it has to come\nSo I put two in the sky to let them know I'm babysittin'\nY'all don't know nothin' 'bout Big Boi, 'cause that nigga steady dipping\nIt ain't over (why that? why that?) 'til the bitch open her mouth up\nAnd sang\n\n[Verse 3: Big Gipp]\nTook me a long time to get here\nLong time man\nI'm talking about, years, and years\nRiding past funeral fields holding bodies of my peers\nIf you don't educate yourself\nNow how the fuck you gonna understand how you supposed to get paid?\nNiggas walk around get with shade tree ass ways\nFuck a fade, let my hair drag\nBack and forth like a see-saw\nJumping Lily, to lilypad dag\nLooking to get my Goodie feel\nI'm broke in like some old men\nWho'd stop dem or would stop\nI'm dropping lines for the big plot\nSixteen is when I started this dream\nIt's ninety-six I'm in your face\nCan you hear that bitch scream?\n\n(It won't be over til that big girl from Decatur sang...)"}}, {"title": "Red Velvet", "album": "Stankonia",

some class G\nAsk me, do OutKast got some flows so you can blast me\nNasty, niggas on the point they see you shining\nEngineers in the studio see me rhyming\nDon't get me wrong, got four albums; stay consisent\nYou got a bodyguard, I let my nigga tote the biscuit\nTwist ya cap back, you got blood off on ya fur hat\nCap, cap, ya link snap, you slumped off in ya Cadillac\nFor what though, some diamonds and a Bentley what you dying for\nAight ho, I'mma bake my cheese and let my mic flow\nPrioritize to live through\nTell these other niggas how you bought yo' kid some tennis shoes\nLet these brothers know that your momma she got her house too\nLet these niggas know that your sister wouldn't of..\nFinished.. college.. without you\nI doubt you, do that though, so do this here\nAnd keep that bullshit out of our ear\nYou too near me to not hear me, too open to conceal me\nThe love for the music keepin Big Boi spittin real G\n\n[Hook]\nCause they know where you live and they've seen what ya drive\nAnd they say they gonna put one in your hel-met\nCause you brag 'bout that watch, and all them things that you got\nThem dirty boys turn your poundcake to red velvet\n\n[Verse 2: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nHow can you measure a nigga by multiple figures he may got, got, got\nHad he not purchased the newest Mercedes\nThat lose it's value soon as you drive that bitch off the lot, lot, lot\nWould he still be the latest, most wanted, doggonit you want it\nHe got it-type nigga 'round the town, town, town\nHad he not played it so flashy\nAshy when half of these niggas hurtin and workin\nWould be he be found, found, found\nIn a ho (ho) tel (tel) room (room) shot up (shot up)\nWith his dick shoved in something he got a lot of\nBill Gates don't dangle diamonds in the face\nOf peasants when he Microsoft'n in the place\nYou gettin on my nerves, well I'm gettin on your case\nConsider your surroundings or you leave without a trace\n\n[Hook]\nCause they know where you live and they've seen what ya drive\nAnd they say they gonna put one in your hel-met\nCause you brag 'bout that watch, and all them things that you got\nThem dirty boys turn your poundcake to red velvet\n\n[Big Boi]\nI know you got the biggest bank roll and you ballin\nFollow the heater because the leader he is haulin\nAss like Juan Valdez, I think he scared\nCause my nigga Khujo Goodie got that toolie to his head\n\n[Andr\u00e9 3000]\nLittle did he know that, waitin in the closet\nNo matter what you call that, playboy sure got done\nDone was the one who came in contact\nWith those with slow goals who prone to sell crack\nOn this megaphone, hey look world I'm on\nYou off, he floss hard cause he celebrate the fact\nLittle did he know that, waitin in the closet\nNo matter what you call that, playboy sure got done\n\n[Hook]\nCause they know where you live and they've seen what ya drive\nAnd they say they gonna put one in your hel-met\nCause you brag 'bout that watch, and all them things that you

G\nAsk me, do OutKast got some flows so you can blast me\nNasty, niggas on the point they see you shining\nEngineers in the studio see me rhyming\nDon't get me wrong, got four albums; stay consisent\nYou got a bodyguard, I let my nigga tote the biscuit\nTwist ya cap back, you got blood off on ya fur hat\nCap, cap, ya link snap, you slumped off in ya Cadillac\nFor what though, some diamonds and a Bentley what you dying for\nAight ho, I'mma bake my cheese and let my mic flow\nPrioritize to live through\nTell these other niggas how you bought yo' kid some tennis shoes\nLet these brothers know that your momma she got her house too\nLet these niggas know that your sister wouldn't of..\nFinished.. college.. without you\nI doubt you, do that though, so do this here\nAnd keep that bullshit out of our ear\nYou too near me to not hear me, too open to conceal me\nThe love for the music keepin Big Boi spittin real G\n\n[Hook]\nCause they know where you live and they've seen what ya drive\nAnd they say they gonna put one in your hel-met\nCause you brag 'bout that watch, and all them things that you got\nThem dirty boys turn your poundcake to red velvet\n\n[Verse 2: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nHow can you measure a nigga by multiple figures he may got, got, got\nHad he not purchased the newest Mercedes\nThat lose it's value soon as you drive that bitch off the lot, lot, lot\nWould he still be the latest, most wanted, doggonit you want it\nHe got it-type nigga 'round the town, town, town\nHad he not played it so flashy\nAshy when half of these niggas hurtin and workin\nWould be he be found, found, found\nIn a ho (ho) tel (tel) room (room) shot up (shot up)\nWith his dick shoved in something he got a lot of\nBill Gates don't dangle diamonds in the face\nOf peasants when he Microsoft'n in the place\nYou gettin on my nerves, well I'm gettin on your case\nConsider your surroundings or you leave without a trace\n\n[Hook]\nCause they know where you live and they've seen what ya drive\nAnd they say they gonna put one in your hel-met\nCause you brag 'bout that watch, and all them things that you got\nThem dirty boys turn your poundcake to red velvet\n\n[Big Boi]\nI know you got the biggest bank roll and you ballin\nFollow the heater because the leader he is haulin\nAss like Juan Valdez, I think he scared\nCause my nigga Khujo Goodie got that toolie to his head\n\n[Andr\u00e9 3000]\nLittle did he know that, waitin in the closet\nNo matter what you call that, playboy sure got done\nDone was the one who came in contact\nWith those with slow goals who prone to sell crack\nOn this megaphone, hey look world I'm on\nYou off, he floss hard cause he celebrate the fact\nLittle did he know that, waitin in the closet\nNo matter what you call that, playboy sure got done\n\n[Hook]\nCause they know where you live and they've seen what ya drive\nAnd they say they gonna put one in your hel-met\nCause you brag 'bout that watch, and all them things that you

selfish\nPut it in ya pelvis\nLet it work, gyrate, motivate\n\n[Hook]\nI'll call before I come\nI won't just pop over, out the blue\nI hope that you do too\nI'll call before I come\nI won't just pop up over, out the blue\nNo, after you\n\n[Verse 1: Andre 3000]\nOh, thank you Lord for throwing some shy\nBones in my body let me tell you why\nIf not so, I'd be too, too bad\nWhen it comes to pink polka dots and plaids\nGlad to meet you, my name is Dre\nBut you can call me Possum Aloysuis Jenkins\nAndre 3000 for short\nAnd naaw I don't want to see your thongs\nI kinda dig them old school cute regular draws\nAnd I will pause for your cause\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Big Boi]\nI'm a gentleman, I'm a satisfy your soul\nAnd then I'm a get mine\nLike Wimbledon we back and forth across the court\nUntil we give out, do you take it all or spit it out\nAre you faking the funk and living a lie\nDo you really know what it feels like\nTo have no control over the G spot?\nIt's like a brand new pair of Reeboks or a junkie freshly detoxed\nYou feel the tingling all over like convulsions or the rooster pox\nI used to not give a damn\nBut now I make it a point just to please you\nSo you can go back and tell all your buddies, I Pretty D'd you\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Gangsta Boo]\nLet's see what you wanna do with the Gangsta Boo\nLet's cut, nigga, nigga what, I'll cut you too\nComing through in a Escalade limo, tint with shade\nPurple haze in the ashtray ready to get a blaze\nWhat the biz nigga jump on in relax wit a lady\nWit a reputation known for sexing niggas till they crazy\nWhatcha mean dog, telling a playa like Boo to call before I come\nYou a game I'm fucking on you for fun\nJoin the bandwagon nigga it's a Gangsta Boo party\nEverybody wanna join come and freak wit somebody\nRiding Jaguars, riding Prowlers all sports cars\nHitting strip bars wit the top down, fuck y'all\nGroupie you need to be glad you even knew me\nDo me and tell all my friends you truly blew me\nBitch\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 4: Eco]\nNigga you better dial 404-584 well bump all that\nBut shit you'd better call before you get here and that's a fact\nBefore you get your feelings hurt\nBecause you caught me playing nurse\nWit a stethoscope running around in one of those cute short white skirts\nI tried to tell you, but you wouldn't respond to Aloysius\nPeeped in the window saw me cooking shrimp\nIn high heels and washing dishes\nFor Daddy Fat Sax and it's something I couldn't explain\nI know it's a dirty, dirty game, but you should called before you came\n\n[Hook]", "image":

Andre 3000]\nNigga, quit being so got damn selfish\nPut it in ya pelvis\nLet it work, gyrate, motivate\n\n[Hook]\nI'll call before I come\nI won't just pop over, out the blue\nI hope that you do too\nI'll call before I come\nI won't just pop up over, out the blue\nNo, after you\n\n[Verse 1: Andre 3000]\nOh, thank you Lord for throwing some shy\nBones in my body let me tell you why\nIf not so, I'd be too, too bad\nWhen it comes to pink polka dots and plaids\nGlad to meet you, my name is Dre\nBut you can call me Possum Aloysuis Jenkins\nAndre 3000 for short\nAnd naaw I don't want to see your thongs\nI kinda dig them old school cute regular draws\nAnd I will pause for your cause\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Big Boi]\nI'm a gentleman, I'm a satisfy your soul\nAnd then I'm a get mine\nLike Wimbledon we back and forth across the court\nUntil we give out, do you take it all or spit it out\nAre you faking the funk and living a lie\nDo you really know what it feels like\nTo have no control over the G spot?\nIt's like a brand new pair of Reeboks or a junkie freshly detoxed\nYou feel the tingling all over like convulsions or the rooster pox\nI used to not give a damn\nBut now I make it a point just to please you\nSo you can go back and tell all your buddies, I Pretty D'd you\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Gangsta Boo]\nLet's see what you wanna do with the Gangsta Boo\nLet's cut, nigga, nigga what, I'll cut you too\nComing through in a Escalade limo, tint with shade\nPurple haze in the ashtray ready to get a blaze\nWhat the biz nigga jump on in relax wit a lady\nWit a reputation known for sexing niggas till they crazy\nWhatcha mean dog, telling a playa like Boo to call before I come\nYou a game I'm fucking on you for fun\nJoin the bandwagon nigga it's a Gangsta Boo party\nEverybody wanna join come and freak wit somebody\nRiding Jaguars, riding Prowlers all sports cars\nHitting strip bars wit the top down, fuck y'all\nGroupie you need to be glad you even knew me\nDo me and tell all my friends you truly blew me\nBitch\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 4: Eco]\nNigga you better dial 404-584 well bump all that\nBut shit you'd better call before you get here and that's a fact\nBefore you get your feelings hurt\nBecause you caught me playing nurse\nWit a stethoscope running around in one of those cute short white skirts\nI tried to tell you, but you wouldn't respond to Aloysius\nPeeped in the window saw me cooking shrimp\nIn high heels and washing dishes\nFor Daddy Fat Sax and it's something I couldn't explain\nI know it's a dirty, dirty game, but you should called before you came\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "Where Are My Panties (Interlude)", "album": "Speakerboxxx / The Love Below", "year": "2003-09-23", "lyrics": "[Intro: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nThe morning after...\n\n[Spoken

what I really wanna know?\nWhere do all the good girls go?\nWhat clubs they hang at?\n\n[Chorus: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nBehold\nA lady\nI see you standing on the wall\nClap, clap, you deserve it all\nBehold (Candy-coated unicorns are)\nA lady (Quite hard to find)\nI see you standing on the wall\n(The classic lady, a rare breed indeed)\nClap, clap, you deserve it all\n(Is that make and model discontinued?)\n\n[Verse 1: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nToday, I might snow, tomorrow, I'll rain\n3000's always changing but you stay the same\nAnd I need that\nHey, I need that (in my life)\nWhen I feel washed up and inadequate\nAnd throw all my songs away, no matter how mad I get\nYou make me smile, you make me smile\nYou make me smile, you make me (Oh)\nYou're the anchor that holds me down\nWhen my ship is sinking, you won't let me drown\nAnd I'm grateful (Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)\n\n[Chorus: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nBehold (Maybe they disappeared with the dinosaurs?)\nA lady (Oh, but that's such a Big Bang Theory)\nI see you standing on the wall (Maybe they're still around?)\nClap, clap, you deserve it all\n(But only to be seen with appreciative eyes)\nBehold (Maybe they were taken for granted?)\nA lady (And lost all their magic)\nI see you standing on the wall (Oh, how awful)\nClap, clap, you deserve it all (Oh, so tragic)\n\n[Verse 2: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nYo mama's old fashioned, yo daddy don't play\nYou'll always be this lovely 'cause they raised you that way\nHallelujah! Thank ya, Jesus! Thank ya, Lord!\nThank ya, Jesus! Thank ya, Lord!\nThank ya, Jesus! Thank ya, Lord!\nYou're not extra extra, you're so plain Jane\nThe ying to my yang, darlin', you've got that thang\nAnd you know it, but yet you don't\nBut yet you don't and that's what's so cool\nYou don't say too much, but when you do, it's profound\nIn the street, you hold your head high\nAt home, you get low down for me\n(Can't get no lower, can't get no lower, can't get no lower, yeah)\nOh, you're the anchor that holds me down\nWhen my ship is sinking, you won't let me drown, ah-ah-ah-ah\nSad, but one day our kids will have to visit museums\nTo see what a lady looks like\n\n[Chorus: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nBehold (So if you find one, I beg you, hold her tight)\nA lady (Yes, if you spot one, good sir, treat her right)\nI see you standing on the wall (Benjamin Andr\u00e9, signing off)\nClap, clap, you deserve it all (Thanks a million)\n(Good luck and goodnight)\nBehold\nA lady\nI see you standing on the wall\nClap, clap, you deserve it all\nBehold\nA lady\nI see you standing on the wall\nClap, clap, you deserve it all\nBehold\nA lady\nI see you standing on the wall"}}, {"title": "Toilet Tisha", "album": "Stankonia", "year": "2000-10-31", "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nHave you heard the news today?\nThey say a little 14-year old little girl had a baby on the way\nToo much for her little mind to bear\nAnd that type of news to her Mama she cannot spare\n\n[Hook: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nToilet Tisha, damn we miss you\nToilet Tisha is the issue\nDamn we miss you, Toilet Tisha\nDamn we miss you\n\n[Interlude]\nTisha?

away\nDon't go away\n\n[Verse 2: Big Boi]\nFive thousand, one hundred ten days is a short period of time\nA mere fourteen years on this precious mother earth\nYou see Tisha had issues\nAnd her decision making skills were still in its early stages\nYou know what I'm talking about\nTherefore she could not properly handle a blessing in which\nShe thought to be an obstacle in her path to adulthood\nPause, Just like a brother with a thousand pauses\nShould I, shouldn't I, I can't, I have to, Mama will never see me the same\nDaddy and Big Mama I know all of them gonna be ashamed of me\nAre just a few thoughts racing through her cranium\nAs she sits on top of the pale, cold porcelain seat in the rear of the house\nThe unthinkable moments away from becoming reality, sadly with no clue\nAnd no way of expressing her feeling to her mama or anybody else in her life\nTisha done came to the crossroads and now she got to choose\nFatality, fatality, fatality, fatality"}}, {"title":

Andr\u00e9 3000 + Big Boi]\nNiggas elope wit ski slopes and fall like avalanches\nTootin' like it's cool: he's a fool, and I can't just\nSit around and watch those nose membranes flame\nMy ends is loose and you can't stop that rain\nWhen it starts to fall\nLookin' like Ms. Pac-Man, hammers and Vogues and cat-man\nI'm speaking about these pros 'cause you know nothing bout that, man\nThe nigga the B-I-G is high and fly like ValuJet\nYou thinkin' about the beatin', this my ends is never met, nigga\nBlack man, white man, Jew man, ain't no joke\nRemember me and my cousin used to sit up on the porch\nAnd talk about when we get older; now we up against the ropes\nYeah, they kickin' niggas door down, 'cause it ain't no dope on the streets\nAnd a quarter pound of feet weed, that's all a nigga like me need\nTalkin' about that Southern sess, nigga, you all up in that mess\nBut never shall you test, and never shall you quit\nRunnin' up on me with that fuck shit will get you nothin' but dead, nigga\n\n[Hook: Sleepy Brown]\nBe careful where you roam cause you might not make it home\n(In the junction, in the junction)\nDon't you dare ever get lost or get caught up in that sauce\n(Junction, junction)\nTo all you players play ya brims and you hustla chrome ya rims\n'Llac and pimps and macks I love the corners that you bend\nY'all, yes, yes, uhh\n(Junction, junction)\n\n[Verse 2: Big Boi + Andr\u00e9 3000]\nUh, well I'm drankin' on 'gnac while I'm dippin' off in that 'llac ('llac)\nThe junkies around my way are always smokin' up on that crack\nBe layin' them College Park hoes flat on they backs (backs)\nLivin' the life of pimps steadily makin' this paper stack\nNiggas don't understand the master plan, crumble yo' herb, man\n'Til they start kickin' the do' in, then we ready to blast them\nOut (Out) like 'Kast ('Kast), we 'bout to crash (crash)\nSo mayday, may Dr\u00e9, knock 'em up off they ass boi\nWe struggle like fat hoes just to get things that those\nPeople got we forgot they always gonna keep a plot\nRight up they sleeve you won't believe they deceive like weave\nThieves can't break in your crib and leave in that good life too\nSo gimme me and then I'm straight, as eight-oh-five\nSee, blindfolds can't cover three eyes\nWe wise to the fact so we attack with what we know\nHeaven is the only good life, so what you strivin' fo'?\n\n[Hook: Sleepy Brown]\nBe careful where you roam cause you might not make it home\n(In the junction, in the junction)\nDon't you dare ever get lost or get caught up in that sauce\n(Junction, junction)\nTo all you

3000]\nWell, like flip-flops and football socks\nA nigga be rockin' the mic like birthdays\nLil' Jon and Sercy, so are you worthy?\nI'm callin' yo' ass a flawed pimp\nYappin' about this crew you run wit'\nBankhead bouncin' to that dumb shit\nSo what mo' can you come wit'?\nYeah, they can bite, but cannot be us\nThey can come and pick up little slang but cannot see us\nYou ought to be ashamed, trying to fit in my adidas\nSo Run like D.M.C. is me and, no, don't got no heater\nWell, we zippin' around the corner in that golden stankin' Lincoln\nI got my heat up under my seat\nJust in case these youngsters tryin' to take it\nPullin' the pistol on another black man was never the plot\nBut sometimes my brothers lose theyself and try to take my spot\nThey come like black stallions in the night\nUsually around fo' or five is when they figure the time is right\nWhen you good and sleep; I couldn't sleep until I seen it\n'Wit my own eyes, 'til they come over the hill\u2014surprise\n\n[Hook: Sleepy Brown]\nBe careful where you roam cause you might not make it home\n(In the junction, in the junction)\nDon't you dare ever get lost or get caught up in that

nigga that's comin' for your throat\nBut not no guillotine see, we be them Southern playas\nRemember the football socks, aerobic Reeboks and Decaturs, now\nYou up to par and ready for your lesson\nI got an ounce of dank and a couple of drinks so let's crank up a session\nLike Tri-Cities High School, was pulling 'em in a broke down Rabbit\nI spit a couple of words and laying em down was just a habit\nJust like Smokey, choking off da pee-wee that we rolled up\nTalking about the clique will get you nathaniel but swolled up\nHootie Hoo slapped you boys across the cheek with Isotoners\nAnd went to tell yo momma and yo pop that you was a goner\nTell 'em Big Boi did it; I swear that nigga be rhyming\nEvery lyric that he spit be turning charcoals into Diamonds and Pearls\nGirl, when you giving up them drawers, 'cause\nI got a couple of niggas down the hall\nThat wanna hit it too, I'm not the type to be acting selfish\nSet it out and let it out and I'll be right back just like Elvis\n'Cause

I tell it like it is so I'm like look here\nJust willing to get what I deserve, my kids do have a mother\nAnd a little house, with a dog in the backyard going \"woof-woof\"\nWho knows what I must face when I leave this recording booth?\nPoof, back in the real world where birds fly\nFrom Miami by way of Cuba to whoever wants to get that high\nThere's clouds of clowns, seas of G's\nPro-jects, packed

the Glock to work\nAnd putting the body to standstills\nMan it kills me\nTaking that life is like taking a shit\nHit or miss, niggas are playing God\nTrying to rob and steal\nThat's why ya gotta guard ya grill\nLike a barbecue cause them harming you\nAre just like honeybees swarming you\nVocally arming you was my responsibility\nIt's killing me thinking that all these niggas see they flauging\nThinking they Steven Seagal and balling\nFalling to the wayside when ya try to call, I've fallen\nWhen we was little nappy headed niggas in the projects\nBut now they carjacks, wait on income tax and unsafe sex\nStill yet they tend to flex - like solo for tha lo-lo\nSmoke same thing -- no-no, not this time\nNiggas around my way can rhyme\nSo fuck that country shit - we done a bunch of shit\nAnd yes ya heard of this out of this world like E.T\nComing across ya T.V\nExtraterrestrial - straight from ATL\n\n[Hook]\nOut of this world\nAre you alien?\nOut of this world\nAre you alien?\nOut of this world\nAre you alien?\nOut of this world\n\n[Verse 2: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nRight now I'm smiling, taking advantage of this moment\nCause there might not be another soon\nHolding on to memories like roller coaster handle bars\nTightly cause I'm slightly off my rocker\nBut to you I may appear to be your average Joe\nBut little do you know that even Joe got problems that he gots to joust with\nFloating in this game of life despite how out of place you may feel\nIn this race oh you just can't quit\nAin't that a bitch that be in heat\nI'm on the beat like cops\nOnly cultivate the stable dirt when I skeet my drops\nNo concentrating knocking other niggas out the box\nWhy? Cause in a sense see we all be kind of fly\nJust can't be scared to spread your wings, head to better things\nMaybe the mockingbird and nightingale they want to sing\nKeeping this thing alive, to the table's what we bring\nWe like hailstorms and blizzards in the middle of the spring\nExtraterrestrial, out of this world\n\n[Hook]\nOut of this world\nAre you alien?\nOut of this world\nAre you alien?\nOut of this world\nAre you alien?\nOut of this world"}}, {"title": "Xplosion", "album": "Stankonia", "year": "2000-10-31", "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nHello lord, it's me again\nI just wanna make love to the whole globe\nAnd all her girlfriends\nNow don't that make ya mind move\nLike smoke patterns, me on my way to Saturn wit' a bomb\nNam-viet, Viet or Saudi Shawty\nI figure before the first gun blast, they know who gon' win\nNow won't that make us all fools, like class clowns\nPraying Private Ryan comes 'round\nSound travels at one-thousand-one-thirty feet per second\nNiggas in the street they want it, hurry\nWhen niggas stop biting that's when 3000 starts to worry\nA little knowledge from the college of wizard Ray Murray\nAnswer quick: do you know what desire is?

whole globe\nAnd all her girlfriends\nNow don't that make ya mind move\nLike smoke patterns, me on my way to Saturn wit' a bomb\nNam-viet, Viet or Saudi Shawty\nI figure before the first gun blast, they know who gon' win\nNow won't that make us all fools, like class clowns\nPraying Private Ryan comes 'round\nSound travels at one-thousand-one-thirty feet per second\nNiggas in the street they want it, hurry\nWhen niggas stop biting that's when 3000 starts to worry\nA little knowledge from the college of wizard Ray Murray\nAnswer quick: do you know what desire is? (Huh?)\nApparently not, that's why you get what you got\nNow answer this: do you know what fire is? (Yeah!)\nThe body of hot, the motivator of pots\nSnot, spit, shit are characteristics of release\nAsk your niece or nephew, you think we left you\nWhat the future holds in its sweaty palms\nThink I'm finna vom'?\nYou move it like you mean it, she'll cum\nProm night might excite a down right fight like\nWhite blood cells to the common cold rebel\nNight gets jealous of day, play is no longer\nThe feelin' gets stronger than ammonia sticks inhale\n\n[Hook: B-Real]\nWe just can't be amazed\nEven if you pull the pin from your hand grenade\nWe just can't be amazed\nEven if you pull the pin from your hand grenade\nWe just can't be amazed\nEven if you pull the pin from your hand grenade\nWe just can't be amazed\nAnd we some home-made bombs\nFinna blow right up in your face\n\n[Verse 2: B-Real]\nLook at the way you look at me, I see it on your face\nAll your hate emanates, but you still hesitate\n'Cause you want inside of my head, but don't know how\nTo brainwash me to be a commercial clown\nFuck that, I see the way you were\nSee the way you smirk\nI'm catching you where you work\nGod only knows all the trouble that grows\nDeep beneath my soul dealing with you assholes\nCan I blast those who point the finger at me\nWho criticize and talk shit so freely\nFuck XXL\u2014you're a size too small\nI should hire Eminem so we can kill you all\nWhether you live to talk shit about the Real\nThen kiss my ass in person how much you love the Hill\nI'm the outcast coming to blaze the grass\nOutlaw due to my life that's come to pass\nDr\u00e9, pass me the glass of wine\nSo I can pour it over my homies grave and mine\nFor all those who fallen and answered when God was calling\nJump into my ragtop and get all in\nI'm the bomb, planted in your car\u2014why you frozen?\nPop the tape in ignite the explosion\nThe world is mine, the world is yours, the world is ours\nThe world is lost, the world is tossed\n\n[Hook: B-Real]\nWe just can't be amazed\nEven if you pull the pin from your hand grenade\nWe just can't be amazed\nEven if you pull the pin from your hand grenade\nWe just can't be amazed\nEven if you pull the pin from your hand grenade\nWe just can't be amazed\nAnd we some home-made bombs\nFinna blow right up in your face\n\n[Verse 3: Big Boi]\nWith a one-two punch, B-Real and Andr\u00e9 drop they verses\nYour homeboy Daddy Fat Sax playin' clean-up, so it worsens\nPeople and persons on the opposite teams, oh, yes, its curtains\nNo bullets burpin', oh, just lyrically twerking, oh\nMaking a statement when you freestyle and your mind is in a free state\nIt's kinda hard to execute when you ain't feeling it that day\nJumpin' the gun and rushing your flow\nBabbling on the mikie like auctioneer\nGot the public's ears fucked up, can't hear\nAtlanta, Georgia where y'all at? (right here)\nOutKast this Dirty South to death the Dungeon Family Camp\nGot this thang licked like stamps and nine-volt battery end caps\nMaking that music that make your neck hurt\nAnd the beats that bother your back in my Cadillac\nSix woofers and four amps\nLo pro vogues on swole, with the carriage lamps\nDiamond tucked velour pistol in my lap\nCome in peace, but then explode like booty traps\n\n[Hook: B-Real]\nWe just can't be amazed\nEven if you pull the pin from your hand grenade\nWe just can't be amazed\nEven if you pull the pin from your hand grenade\nWe just can't be amazed\nEven if you pull the pin from your hand grenade\nWe just can't be amazed\nAnd we some home-made bombs\nFinna blow right up in your face\n\n[Outro: Debra Killings]\nDo-do-do, do, do-do-do\nDo-do-do, do, do-do-do\nDo-do-do, do, do-do-do\nDo-do-do, do, do-do-do"}}, {"title": "Wailin'", "album": "ATLiens", "year": "1996-08-27", "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Big Boi]\nIn the zone like Keyser S\u00f6ze\nAlways the Usual Suspect\nNo check, all I got in this game is my respect\nAnd Southern pride, I'd be\nChecking my fucking head\nScared, looking up in your face, boy, I see dead\nIf you test like SAT, then I guess that we may be\nEnemies in the P's, freestyles be freebies\nI be that wrong nigga to fuck with, wouldn't I?\nWouldn't I be the wrong one to try\nNever eating chicken thighs\nOnly the twenty piece mojo\nFlows on like Flo Jo\nI wanted to figure out, just how low could your hoe go\nThe beat hit like Beat Street\nKrush Groove and Breakin'\nNever baking, rebuking Satan\nWe had you waiting\nFor the Second Coming, funny how time flies when you're rhyming\nLaFace Records, I think they got that perfect timing\nTo be doper than Saddam, believe the Nation of Islam\nFuck the police and the dogs, sniffing that dope up out your car\nI think they overstep they boundaries\nOJ, not guilty, that's how they found he\n\n[Interlude: Cee-Lo]\nMmm, yeah, mmm, mmm (Repeat 4X)\n\n[Verse 2: Andre]\nI felt the pressure like sun shining\nWhile raining at the same time\nI kept on rhyming\nNot complaining\nStorm braining cats and dogs\nMy catalog be the size of golf balls\nThrow up your Daisy Dukes\nI'm Hazzard-ous to all you Boss Hoggs\nAnd Rosco P.

be freebies\nI be that wrong nigga to fuck with, wouldn't I?\nWouldn't I be the wrong one to try\nNever eating chicken thighs\nOnly the twenty piece mojo\nFlows on like Flo Jo\nI wanted to figure out, just how low could your hoe go\nThe beat hit like Beat Street\nKrush Groove and Breakin'\nNever baking, rebuking Satan\nWe had you waiting\nFor the Second Coming, funny how time flies when you're

Aquemini)\n(Killer Mike-Roc-A-Fella collaboration\u2014holla!)\n\n[Chorus: JAY-Z +Big Boi]\nYoung Hov' in the place to be\nBig Boi in the place to be (Young!)\nAndr\u00e9 3000 (Cash!) Shout out to public housing, bitch\nI brought (Holla!) the whole hood with me\nYou got red dirt in your afro\nYoung Hov' in the place to be (Yeah)\nOutKast in the place to be (Yeah)\n\n[Verse 1: Big Boi]\nDid you ever think that you would be the nigga on the block?\nDidn't have to break a steerin column, didn't have to cook a rock\nA damn goodie two-shoes, that what they call ya\nNever judge a person or a book by it's covers\nJust because my tone is darker than yours, a little tanner\nYou never took the time out, examine yourself boi\n.. are you black, white, Asian?\nIndonesian, or Borean; that's black and Korean\nWe on the same team if we breathin\nI jumped off the subject to see if you was seein\nThat we drop a little science off in every verse\nThey put that P.A. sticker on it cause they scared we gon' curse\nBut the knowledge is the power, the cowards get devoured\nAny hour, any cipher, any way to any height\nBecause I might just snap on a fuck-ass nigga\nMight clap a cap at a sucka-ass nigga\nIn the meantime, Daddy Fat Sax gon' chill out\nHe might just, pull out his pistol\nAnd let that thang whistle at your windshield or your residence\nSuperman to Clark Kent, you better be way harder\nThan the park bench to start this\nMarcus, Jason, my little brother James\nAll my brothers from my momma but Andre is just the same\nAin't no uno, we a duo; deuce dos to a pair\nA player stiffen the competition\nPressed like Levi's and toughskins, one minus one\nNegative one minus negative one is nothin\nBustin d-boy raps and player poems\nThe 'Kast shit ain't plastic, we smash it and move the crowd\nAnd rock the crowd original material while you bore 'em\nYour live show consists of everybody's shit but you're-uns\nDo your own shit! In your live show (Bitin'-ass nigga)\n\n[Chorus: JAY-Z]\nYoung Hov' in the place to be\nBig Boi in the place to be (Young!)\nAndr\u00e9 3000 (Cash) shout out to public housing, bitch!\nI brought

whole hood with me (Yeah, yeah)\n\n[Verse 2: Big Boi]\nPenelope Ann Cruz couldn't snooze\nWith her Eyes Wide Shut, before I asked to hit her gut\nIf you brunette, Legally Blonde I might respond\nTake you to Swan Lake and beyond\nAntwan raps on, raps on, clap off clap on\nI switch the flow so quick you cannot fa-thom\nI take a submarine two thousand leagues below the sea\nAnd try to grab one line or sentence\nRhyme repentance, find the illest lyricist\nAnd give him a clean bill of health\nWealth might make you look good but you sound like shit\nAnd your team lookin shitty to death\n\n[Verse 3: Killer Mike]\nMy nigga Big Boi said, watch 'em as they gawk and they gander\nYou can follow or lead like Commander Picard\nYou can have \"The Whole World\"\nOr be satisfied with the boulevard, overstand\nThis young player's rhyme\nI foregoed the crime and I focused on rhyme\nFocused on every word, and line\nLike a young Cassius Clay in his prime\nI was born to talk shit and prove mine, and I'm\nThe epitome of raw rhyme\nGot signed, got serious about the craft\nOf raw rhyme and I got mine\u2014Aqueminis\nMurderous monster move minds\nDid it so hard that it oughta be a crime\nWhen you see I'm comin holla one-time, holla one-time\nWhen you see I'm comin holla one-time (One-time)\n\n[Chorus: JAY-Z]\nYoung Hov' in the place to be\nBig Boi in the place to be (Young!)\nAndr\u00e9 3000

out to public housing, bitch!\nI brought (Holla!) the whole hood with me (Yeah, yeah)\n\n[Interlude]\nDon't, you, like, to groove\nIn your hooptie on your old, flip, flop, sweatshoes\nTo run yo' tennis shoes\nDon't, it, matter to you\nThat OutKast we got that slump for y'all\nKeep that funk for y'all\n\n[Verse 4: JAY-Z]\nWhen I'm in the mood I rock the S Dot tennis shoes\nAt the interlude, I got the Gucci flip-flops\nAnd I, fix it up like gin and juice when I'm them interviews\nDudes wanna know what he copped\nAnd where you got that, and how could they buy that\nWhere the million dollar watch at, stop that!\nWhy that, why this, niggas wanna hijack the flyness\nI'm on a whole 'nother plane\nA whole different lane, a whole 'nother game that I'm playin\nUnderstand what I'm sayin\nHov' and OutKast, whatchu think about that?\nReally don't matter though what you niggas chatter though\nAnybody get out of line then you trust\nThat the Mac'll go b-r-r-r-r-ap, got you killed for that alone\nBack on the shit, back on the strip\nAnother hit I'm not gon' miss\n\n[Interlude]"}}, {"title": "Pink & Blue", "album": "Speakerboxxx / The Love Below", "year": "2003-09-23", "lyrics": "[Intro:

Guest vocals are contributed by Scar and Sleepy Brown, two Georgia-native performers the same as the Outkast duo.\n\nTrue to the track\u2019s name, the Wolverine Marching Band of MBC provided the instrumental for this song back in 1999 where it was intended to be released on Outkast\u2019s fourth studio release, Stankonia. Although the track didn\u2019t see an album release until 2006, the vocals were redone to compensate for the seven year wait."}, "comment_count": 0, "community": true, "custom_preview": null,

"[Intro]\nGreetings, earthlings. Take me to your leader (ooh shit!)\n\n[Hook]\nD.E.E.P. you want to go D.E.E.P., I'll take ya D.E.E.P\nYou know you fucked up when you let my mind creep\nDeeper than the page of a book let me look\nYou let me hit the stage, that's when I got my folks hooked like...\n\n[Verse 1: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nDeeper than deep dish, hammers and vogues\nDeeper than thee fish in the O(cean)\nI got my gun on standby, like Coast Guards\nYou boast hard, you'll get your salty ass crumbled like erb, word (hey man)\nYou heard it here first with your master plan in reverse\nI ain't the one with the curse, so disperse, yes, catching plagues\nNiggas catching AIDS, niggas getting sprayed, niggas on they way\nTo a dead end, you won't catch me spreading no white thighs\nI only see afro bitches up in my eyes\nI don't eat no beef and surely not no pork\nI used to drink that 8, but now I shove it down your throat\nQuote, 'If they kill they own folks, what you think they gonna do to you?'\nI'm Outkasted and claiming true\nAiming two at your muthafucking spine\nNo, I make that three cause I don't wanna hear you whine\nSwine, got my folks blind, like Stevie\nMe be, wondering when I'm gonna see the end\nAndre Ben' slamming backs like King acts\nOver Organized tracks full of facts\nSo you know that it's D.E.E.P\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Big Boi]\nWell, you want me to get D.E.E.P., well then, I will\nWhat? What will happen if you shoot that nigga and don't kill\nHe will come back and return like Lalah Hathaway\nAiming for your skull, yeah I'm flexing on you that a way\nSo if you pulling a tool, nigga you better use it\nCause if you're threatening my life, better believe I'll be a fool with it\nI don't take no shit from nobody\nI gots the Goodie Mo crew right beside of me\nDamn, no pain, no gain, so I'mma hurt you\nBreaking knees and elbows like I used to break my curfew\nMy mama used to tell me if a nigga ever hit me\nJust to pick up the closest thing and knock the living shit out of he\nSo if you run up, you get done up, I'mma end it\nThrow the gun up out the window, see the corner that I bent it\nIt's just so simple how we get so D.E.E.P\nLearn a lesson, pick up the album when it hits the streets like...\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nNo, I ain't never been pimped by the system\nThat's because I ain't no slave\nDon't be trying to sunbathe, never lived off in no cave\nBloody old chap and in this head of mine is full of naps\nAnd the only thing I know is how to fuck and how to rap\nY'all think I'm stupid cause I shoots 'em up like cupid\nAnd if you gave me a basketball, I'll show you how to shoot it\nMy head's polluted cause I'm zooted, bobbin to the bottom\nIf a pair of Jordan's came out, y'all figure that I got 'em\nBut no I don't because I don't be having funds\nThe gold that I am wearing is really made out of bronze\nIt weighs a ton and making my neck turn green\nAnd I got a criminal record that will never come clean\nOh, and it seems that I make babies like a rabbit\nAnd then never taking care of them has just become a habit\nI grab my tablet and get busy with the pen\nY'all could not be just like me if y'all was my twin\nSo you get mad and try to make me inferior\nYou pissing me off, I'm in that ass like interior\nOh, step in my Cadillac, let's ride through the hood\nEh, why don't you roll that window down so you can see it real good\nAnd take a look at all the pimps and all the pushers and the players\nThat's living on a whim, thin ice and a prayer\nOh and mayor, can I gets a little backup\nPlease don't let them Dixie muthafuckas put that flag up\nBut let me shut up cause they say we equal\nWhenever the fuck our record comes out in 1994\nYeah, yes sir, it's like that\nGonna take y'all deep, so go back\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 4: Big Boi]\nI'm getting deeper than that prostitutes vagina\nAnd pimping way mo' hoes than there's peoples out in China\nI roll that black Lac with the crust velvet interior\nNiggas try to bite that shit, but their shit is inferior\nWe rolling thick like the Pillsbury Doughboy\nAnd I don't give a damn, muthafucka cause you know why\nThe Caucus Mountains and the mutant gene\nYou try to wipe a nigga like me slam up off the scene\nYou hairy bastard, work a little bit faster\nBecause of the shit that I done been through, I shall never call you master\nYou D-E-V-I-L, the cave is where you dwell\nSo stay up out the rain, it's beginning to smell like dog, yeah\nI wonder how you would be acting if youse in my shoes\nYou'd probably shit your tight ass draws cause I got a short ass fuse\nSo what do you really wanna do when I get militant\nThought I was a pimp, flip the script if you can' get with this\nThey call me Big Boi, I be capping with a big gun\nRun up on it if you want it, then you bite the big one, yeah\nUh huh, can you deal with it, D-E-V-I-L\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "Myintrotoletuknow", "album": "Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik",

vultures, slam my nigga back out\nTo make his ass black out, or even pull your fucking heater\nTo make his whole crew believers, you're harder than a bitch full of dicks\nBut that don't be sounding like King Shit to me\nSee now in the ghetto or should I be saying Lakewood\nYou better be strapped cause them niggas over there just ain't good\nJust being a hustler, serving the loyal customers\nRent was due on the first of the month so I'm hustling\nI buy you 50 box of Phillies at the Citgo\nAnd niggas be wanting drinks and shit from the fucking sto', yo\nBut that's aight though, cause I be getting paid\nAnd every trip I take, there's a dollar to be made\nI'm digging through my pockets for my earnings got you five\nDeep, there it is, now it's time to smoke that dime\n\n[Chorus: Big Boi]\nIf you smoke a dime, then I'll smoke a dime\nIf you smoke a dime, then I'll smoke a dime\n\n[Verse 2: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nTime is slipping, slowly but surely\nNiggas I used to hang with wants to act like they don't know me\nCome and listen to my story, I gots a lot of shit up on my mind\nI wipe the boo-boo from my brain then I finish up my rhyme\nTake a number, I caught you in a slumber\nI hit you for a lick, I'm in the slammer for the summer\nBut now it is the fall, I'm having a ball, making my nickel sacks crawl\nTo my niggas got to serving when they beep and when they call\nI got the Peter, Paul and plus that Mary Jane\nI'm rolling reefer out of a Regal, how could I refrain\nFrom being rough, from being tough, from being dangerous\nI'm hanging with the P.A., nigga, ain't no changing us\nSee you can try, if you try, if you don't, you don't\nIf you wanna battle, it's either that you will or you won't\nSee that rap shit is really just like selling smoke\nIf you got some fire shit, yo niggas gonna always toke\nDope, is not what I be slanging on this track\nNiggas don't comprehend that it be deeper than Cadillacs\nYou know that, right, you bite, you fucked up\nYou won't be getting away this time, I'm real as hell, so what's up\nI rip shit wit pimp shit, I'm slanging it from the South\nTalk bad about the A-town, I'll bust you in your fucking mouth\n\n[Chorus:

in the days when we was slaves I bet we was some cool ass niggas\nBut now we vultures, slam my nigga back out\nTo make his ass black out, or even pull your fucking heater\nTo make his whole crew believers, you're harder than a bitch full of dicks\nBut that don't be sounding like King Shit to me\nSee now in the ghetto or should I be saying Lakewood\nYou better be strapped cause them niggas over there just ain't good\nJust being a hustler, serving the loyal customers\nRent was due on the first of the month so I'm hustling\nI buy you 50 box of Phillies at the Citgo\nAnd niggas be wanting drinks and shit from the fucking sto', yo\nBut that's aight though, cause I be getting paid\nAnd every trip I take, there's a dollar to be made\nI'm digging through my pockets for my earnings got you five\nDeep, there it is, now it's time to smoke that dime\n\n[Chorus: Big Boi]\nIf you smoke a dime, then I'll smoke a dime\nIf you smoke a dime, then I'll smoke a dime\n\n[Verse 2: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nTime is slipping, slowly but surely\nNiggas I used to hang with wants to act like they don't know me\nCome and listen to my story, I gots a lot of shit up on my mind\nI wipe the boo-boo from my brain then I finish up my rhyme\nTake a number, I caught you in a slumber\nI hit you for a lick, I'm in the slammer for the summer\nBut now it is the fall, I'm having a ball, making my nickel sacks crawl\nTo my niggas got to serving when they beep and when they call\nI got the Peter, Paul and plus that Mary Jane\nI'm rolling reefer out of a Regal, how could I refrain\nFrom being rough, from being tough, from being dangerous\nI'm hanging with the P.A., nigga, ain't no changing us\nSee you can try, if you try, if you don't, you don't\nIf you wanna battle, it's either that you will or you won't\nSee that rap shit is really just like selling smoke\nIf you got some fire shit, yo niggas gonna always toke\nDope, is not what I be slanging on this track\nNiggas don't comprehend that it be deeper than Cadillacs\nYou know that, right, you bite, you fucked up\nYou won't be getting away this time, I'm real as hell, so what's up\nI rip shit wit pimp shit, I'm slanging it from the South\nTalk bad about the A-town, I'll bust you in your fucking mouth\n\n[Chorus: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nIf you smoke a dime, then I'll smoke a dime\nIf you smoke a dime, then I'll smoke a dime"}}, {"title": "Call of Da Wild", "album": "Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik", "year": "1994-04-26", "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nI'll be coming around the ghetto when I come kicking one for the treble\nY'all can't stoop to my level, I'm like the devil or whatever\nI'm picking em up and throwing em down like dishes\nCall me Kenny Anderson cause I slam the sons of bitches\nI ain't bragging, folks dragging me up and down the road\nThey'll be fucked up when I gets into my calling mode\nThen cut the clown up on they ass like Bozo\nOh no, then dance on top of they asses like Jo Jo Dancer\nCome Comet, come Dasher, come Prancer\nCome niggas with machine guns, I think that is the answer\nBut the question \"Should we take that bullshit from them people?\"\nI'm making 300 on my SAT yet I am equal\nAin't no sequel, no saga, no way out, I'm nervous\nI've had it up to fo'head of suckas tryin to serve us\nTo graduate is really becomin a very stressful journey\nI feel like a steering wheel, for them is trying to turn me\nInto a hate monger, and I'm wishing and I wonder\nDamn, will I graduate before I hit the summer\nI think not, Officer Friendly tryin to dig up in me\nHe said I'm half assed and got no future\nAnd so he sent me up the creek and shit\nStroking like hell without no paddle\nBut niggas is gettin smart, we back on the saddle\nNo longer, y'all know y'all had us down for some years\nIt's the call of da wild nigga, uh, there it is\n\n[Hook: Cee-Lo Green]\nI hear voices in my head and they keep calling me\nI hear voices in my head and they keep calling me\nI hear voices in my head and they keep calling me\nI hear voices in my head and they keep calling me\n\n[Verse 2: T-Mo]\nAs I step up, the stage is empty\nNo words cause I serve with my Southern dialect, so I get respect\nDon't call me T, it's a T thang with a G swang\nLet my nuts hang down to the flo' mane\nSmoking that dang dang, making mics swang\nIn my 2-8-0 Z, nobody can see me, cruising down the block\nJust like I was a squirrel in a world full of nuts\nDamn, I'd probably be mad even if I called Uncle Sam\nTo bring dough to the Goodie Mo-B\nT-Mo, Khujo, Cee-Lo, J and my homie Brandon B\nDon't flex, I'm next, I break necks too\nRolling with Outkast, PA, Goodie Mob for the 94\nHa-ha-ha. Yeah, you know what I'm sayin?\n\n[Hook: Cee-Lo Green]\nI hear voices in my head and they keep calling me\nI hear voices in my head and they keep calling me\nI hear voices in my head and they keep calling me\nI hear voices in my head and they keep calling me\n\n[Verse 3: Big Boi]\nYeah, I'm steady bucking muthafuckas\nNot ducking 'em like duck goose, I'm heavily strapped, yeah niggas\nSqueezing rhymes like that noose around your neck\nYou can't hang with this, see ain't no thangs to this\nI show no pity so take off because I'm dangerous\nI breaks 'em off like I was Beat Street, see I be breaking\nSpeaking of breaking, break on out or get your life taken, boy\nFucking around with me will get your cabbage cut, your wig split\nSimply means I'm bringing the funk with the hollow tips\nPlaya shit is how I'm kicking it\nComing around the ghetto, victims soft as a tack on a jackass\nSo fuck it or flip it, I'll still be a playa\nPuffy afro with nigga naps off in my hair\nShit, that's simply how I run my shit and that's how it be\nThat nigga B-I-G B-O-I, that be me, yeek\nSee I'm a playa, got my struggle on\nThinking about the volume and thickness of my bankroll\nYou see the cops is in my shit like colon cancer\nEven though I never smoke that shit like (right)...yeah\nI give a call of da wild to my niggas around the projects\nSo don't flex or get served with a pop neck shit\nOG, original gangsta, not quite\nBut maybe when I'm locked up, lifting weights, getting swole right\nLife's a bitch with a G-string, it's either in your ass or it ain't\nSo you can see who can really hang\nBut y'all don't wanna do nothing, y'all can go to hell\nAin't no playas in office cause I'm locked off in a cell\nSo can you feel me, nigga\n\n[Hook: Cee-Lo Green]\nI hear voices in my head and they keep calling me\nI hear voices in my head and they keep calling me\nI hear voices in my head and they keep calling me\nI hear voices in my head and they keep calling me\n\n[Verse 4: Khujo]\nKhujo, coming in dope, bring it\nI got more problems than the average Joe\nSo bro don't come 'round me with your flim flam, hot damn\nIt's a jack, top of the burbs, and my notebook is a bird\nK's madness into capping\nThrow in a few more logs, so my fire looking through the want ads\nAnd only red hot, desire in your pot is something wicked\nBut you can't feel it, stick it up your monkey ass\nI could let shit ride in the past, now it's time to blast that ass\nShhh... Mr. Knighton take off your hat\nCan't even my wear my locs in\nDemon eye scoping, oh my, peripheral vision got it\nMade you go no holds barred\nDecisions, decisions to make, oops, here comes the Goodie Mo crew\nAnd they just might want to battle you\nOut with the quickness\nThe price of living is beginning to be a risky business\nUncaged, Parkay\nHow do you like the taste of hot butter melting through your biscuits?\nThis is your brain on drugs, this is your brain...\nDope cut niggas I hang with before there were apartments\nIn Chappell Forest, it's gettin horrid\nThe hunted child is on the prowl, yahhh!!!!!\nI let out a call to da wild\nI let out a call to da wild", "image": "https://images.genius.com/147e5098e96af0503b7515285d9f9a34.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "OutKast",

ghetto when I come kicking one for the treble\nY'all can't stoop to my level, I'm like the devil or whatever\nI'm picking em up and throwing em down like dishes\nCall me Kenny Anderson cause I slam the sons of bitches\nI ain't bragging, folks dragging me up and down the road\nThey'll be fucked up when I gets into my calling mode\nThen cut the clown up on they ass like Bozo\nOh no, then dance on top of they asses like Jo Jo Dancer\nCome Comet, come Dasher, come Prancer\nCome niggas with machine guns, I think that is the answer\nBut the question \"Should we take that bullshit from them people?\"\nI'm making 300 on my SAT yet I am equal\nAin't no sequel, no saga, no way out, I'm nervous\nI've had it up to fo'head of suckas tryin to serve us\nTo graduate is really becomin a very stressful journey\nI feel like a steering wheel, for them is trying to turn me\nInto a hate monger, and I'm wishing and I wonder\nDamn, will I graduate before I hit the summer\nI think not, Officer Friendly tryin to dig up in me\nHe said I'm half assed and got no future\nAnd so he sent me up the creek and shit\nStroking like hell without no paddle\nBut niggas is gettin smart, we back on the saddle\nNo longer, y'all know y'all had us down for some years\nIt's the call of da wild nigga, uh, there it is\n\n[Hook: Cee-Lo Green]\nI hear voices in my head and they keep calling me\nI hear voices in my head and they keep calling me\nI hear voices in my head and they keep calling me\nI hear voices in my head and they keep calling me\n\n[Verse 2: T-Mo]\nAs I step up, the stage is empty\nNo words cause I serve with my Southern dialect, so I get respect\nDon't call me T, it's a T thang with a G swang\nLet my nuts hang down to the flo' mane\nSmoking that dang dang, making mics swang\nIn my 2-8-0 Z, nobody can see me, cruising down the block\nJust like I was a squirrel in a world full of nuts\nDamn, I'd probably be mad even if I called Uncle Sam\nTo bring dough to the Goodie Mo-B\nT-Mo, Khujo, Cee-Lo, J and my homie Brandon B\nDon't flex, I'm next, I break necks too\nRolling with Outkast, PA, Goodie Mob for the 94\nHa-ha-ha. Yeah, you know what I'm sayin?\n\n[Hook: Cee-Lo Green]\nI hear voices in my head and they keep calling me\nI hear voices in my head and they keep calling me\nI hear voices in my head and they keep calling me\nI hear voices in my head and they keep calling me\n\n[Verse 3: Big Boi]\nYeah, I'm steady bucking muthafuckas\nNot ducking 'em like duck goose, I'm heavily strapped, yeah niggas\nSqueezing rhymes like that noose around your neck\nYou can't hang with this, see ain't no thangs to this\nI show no pity so take off because I'm dangerous\nI breaks 'em off like I was Beat Street, see I be breaking\nSpeaking of breaking, break on out or get your life taken, boy\nFucking around with me will get your cabbage cut, your wig split\nSimply means I'm bringing the funk with the hollow tips\nPlaya shit is how I'm kicking it\nComing around the ghetto, victims soft as a tack on a jackass\nSo fuck it or flip it, I'll still be a playa\nPuffy afro with nigga naps off in my hair\nShit, that's simply how I run my shit and that's how it be\nThat nigga B-I-G B-O-I, that be me, yeek\nSee I'm a playa, got my struggle on\nThinking about the volume and thickness of my bankroll\nYou see the cops is in my shit like colon cancer\nEven though I never smoke that shit like (right)...yeah\nI give a call of da wild to my niggas around the projects\nSo don't flex or get served with a pop neck shit\nOG, original gangsta, not quite\nBut maybe when I'm locked up, lifting weights, getting swole right\nLife's a bitch with a G-string, it's either in your ass or it ain't\nSo you can see who can really hang\nBut y'all don't wanna do nothing, y'all can go to hell\nAin't no playas in office cause I'm locked off in a cell\nSo can you feel me, nigga\n\n[Hook: Cee-Lo Green]\nI hear voices in my head and they keep calling me\nI hear voices in my head and they keep calling me\nI hear voices in my head and they keep calling me\nI hear voices in my head and they keep calling me\n\n[Verse 4: Khujo]\nKhujo, coming in dope, bring it\nI got more problems than the average Joe\nSo bro don't come 'round me with your flim flam, hot damn\nIt's a jack, top of the burbs, and my notebook is a bird\nK's madness into capping\nThrow in a few more logs, so my fire looking through the want ads\nAnd only red hot, desire in your pot is something wicked\nBut you can't feel it, stick it up your monkey ass\nI could let shit ride in the past, now it's time to blast that ass\nShhh... Mr. Knighton take off your hat\nCan't even my wear my locs in\nDemon eye scoping, oh my, peripheral vision got it\nMade you go no holds barred\nDecisions, decisions to make, oops, here comes the Goodie Mo crew\nAnd they just might want to battle you\nOut with the quickness\nThe price of living is beginning to be a risky business\nUncaged, Parkay\nHow do you like the taste of hot butter melting through your biscuits?\nThis is your brain on drugs, this is your brain...\nDope cut niggas I hang with before there were apartments\nIn Chappell Forest, it's gettin horrid\nThe hunted child is on the prowl, yahhh!!!!!\nI let out a call to da wild\nI let out a call to da wild"}}, {"title": "Take Off Your Cool", "album": "Speakerboxxx / The Love Below", "year": "2003-09-23", "lyrics": "[Intro: Andr\u00e9 3000 & Norah Jones]\nHey, oh\nBa-do-ba, ba-do-ba\nHey, oh\nBa-do-ba, ba-do-ba\n\n[Verse 1: Norah Jones]\nBaby, take off your cool\nI wanna see you, I wanna see you\nBaby, don't be so cool\nI wanna see you, I wanna see you\n\n[Verse 2: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nBaby, take off your cool\nI want to get to know you\n(Baby, take off your cool)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9c95e6c91deee00543064991b835ada0.999x999x1.jpg", "artist": "OutKast", "raw": {"annotation_count": 6, "api_path": "/songs/36316", "apple_music_id": "1435819852", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/36316/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "In this song, both Andre and Norah want their lovers to be themselves.

love look like?\nLove looks like you\nWhat does love love feel like?\nLove feels like this\nWhat does love smell like?\nLove smells like us\n\n[Verse 1 : Andr\u00e9 3000]\nYou make me understand\nWhat it means to be in l-o-v-e once again\nWhy, must we fly so low?\nAre we 'fraid of heights, do kites get lost in the tow\n\n[Hook]\nStank love\nStank love\nStank love\nStank love\n\n[Verse 2 : Sleepy Brown]\nLet me show your mind a new freaky side of love\nOpen up you flower please let me taste your love\nHoneysuckle sweet, can't stop till I get every drip drop on my tongue\nHitting every spot of you, what you gonna do\nYour body is the rhythm of the boom in the room\nUp and down it seems to go\nOh my god I think I'm bout to explode\n\n[Hook]\nStank love\nStank love\nStank love\nStank love\n\n[Verse 3 : Big Rube]\nMy fingertips scan flesh so supple\nNo longer a couple like two in one skin\nWhere do you end and where do I begin\nBoth brains become one mind sensually\nEvery nerve becoming it's own individual entity\nWith its own lusts, it's own needs to serve\nLonging for the love of all the other nevers\nAs they writhe and twist in satisfaction\nIn the burning chill of pleasure we bathe\nEngulfing, encompassing like a cataclysmic shockwave\nOf an impact so deep, but not one of destruction\nBut of creation, elation in the re-making\nNo faking in the relation, no taking in the relation\nJust giving of ther persona making lover after making love\n'Til ain't nothing but Stankonia\n\n[Hook]\nStank love\nStank love\nStank love\nStank love", "image":

feels like this\nWhat does love smell like?\nLove smells like us\n\n[Verse 1 : Andr\u00e9 3000]\nYou make me understand\nWhat it means to be in l-o-v-e once again\nWhy, must we fly so low?\nAre we 'fraid of heights, do kites get lost in the tow\n\n[Hook]\nStank love\nStank love\nStank love\nStank love\n\n[Verse 2 : Sleepy Brown]\nLet me show your mind a new freaky side of love\nOpen up you flower please let me taste your love\nHoneysuckle sweet, can't stop till I get every drip drop on my tongue\nHitting every spot of you, what you gonna do\nYour body is the rhythm of the boom in the room\nUp and down it seems to go\nOh my god I think I'm bout to explode\n\n[Hook]\nStank love\nStank love\nStank love\nStank love\n\n[Verse 3 : Big Rube]\nMy fingertips scan flesh so supple\nNo longer a couple like two in one skin\nWhere do you end and where do I begin\nBoth brains become one mind sensually\nEvery nerve becoming it's own individual entity\nWith its own lusts, it's own needs to serve\nLonging for the love of all the other nevers\nAs they writhe and twist in satisfaction\nIn the burning chill of pleasure we bathe\nEngulfing, encompassing like a cataclysmic shockwave\nOf an impact so deep, but not one of destruction\nBut of creation, elation in the re-making\nNo faking in the relation, no taking in the relation\nJust giving of ther persona making lover after making love\n'Til ain't nothing but Stankonia\n\n[Hook]\nStank love\nStank love\nStank love\nStank love"}}, {"title": "Mighty \"O\"", "album": "Idlewild", "year": "2006-06-27", "lyrics": "[Hook: Andr\u00e9

Huh?\nPlease tell me - what are we here foooooooorrrrrrrrrr?\nOW!\n\n[Verse Two: Big Boi]\nLife, is nothing but a dream, so peaceful and serene\nUnless you're being evil then you on the devil's team\nWide receive what you want to believe\nBut soon you'll have to sew those bad seeds\nPlease, any man can ask to get a pass\nOr a cleansing of sin to grant another chance\nPerhaps another glance of the light at the end of the tunnel\nTalk to the coach or break out the huddle\nWhatever should you fumble your rebuttal should be subtle\n'Cause he who lives in the upper room is never gullible\nAs you survey the syllables and sentences\nThe question that I'm merely trying to pose is as simple as me saying\nWhat about repentance?\nWhat about detention?\nWhat about you eating dinner in the devil's kitchen?\nWhat about repentance?\nWhat about committing the same sin\nOver and over again and again and ah..\n\n[Hook: Sleepy Brown]\nSometimes life can keep you down, with your face all in the dirt\nNow if you feel that left behind, need to get up and go to church\nOoooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh\nOoooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh..\n\n[Hook - singers]\nWhy are we here?

up\n\n[Hook: Sleepy Brown & Jazze Pha]\nCrocodile on my feet\nFox fur on my back\nBowtie 'round my neck\nThat's why they call me the gangsta mack\nIn the Cadillac, yeah\nCrocodile on my feet\nFox fur on my back\nBowtie 'round my neck\nThat's why they call me the gangsta mack\nIn the Cadillac, yeah\n\n[Verse 1: Big Boi]\nNasty Noompsy Knightingale, fresh in that tuxedo\nCummerbund with no suspenders, my torpedo, you libido\nNeed to chat (Chip, chop it up, shoot the breeze!)\nI'm your r-o-l-a-i-d-s, release the squeeze or release the keys\nTo the shackles on her wrist, she can tackle some of this\nSmack on smack on some of this Dick Tracy\nArrest her, book her, fingerprint your hooker\nYou took her to the club and now her body is full of liquor\nOff that Butterscotch Schnapps and Bailey's Irish Cream\nShe's a damsel in distress impressed with stylish things\nWhatcha mean? (Chip, chop it up, shoot the breeze!)\nIn the parking lot we primp, crooked booty to the scene where I\n\n[Hook: Sleepy Brown]\nCrocodile on my feet\nFox fur on my back\nBowtie 'round my neck\nThat's why they call me the gangsta mack\nIn the Cadillac, yeah\n\n[Verse 2: Big Boi]\nOh, lord, how can it be so hard?\nTo put on a pair of panties much less a pair of jeans or the leotard\nBut I got to start by complimenting you on your physique\nYou unique, you best believe I'm gon' skeet once I speak\nSpoke, spit, spatter, spat and I macked her just like that\nBut it takes years of perseverance and experience to get that cat\nSo why don't I chase this Hennessy down with some of that\nOn your back, like a cheerleader missing the final stack\nAs we strut, skip the line through the glass window, glance\nWe look fine, right on time as we step in the place\nThe nursery's crunk, we've come to play\n\n[Verse 3: Sleepy Brown]\nEverybody's watching cause them furs just hit the door\nWhile the gator's creeping, crawling, oh so wicked across that floor\nTo the V.I.P. where we proceed to give you what you need\nThrow your hands up if you feel me\nThrow your hands up if you feel me\n'Cause we well designed, like the finest wine\nFeel good to be fly, so don't you ask me why\nI got the ladies in line, because they can't deny\nSo raise your hands to the sky, 'cause we super fly\n\n[Hook: Sleepy Brown]\nCrocodile on my feet\nFox fur on my back\nBowtie 'round my neck\nThat's why they call me the gangsta mack\nIn the Cadillac, yeah\nCrocodile on my feet\nFox fur on my back\nBowtie 'round my neck\nThat's why they call me the gangsta mack\nIn the Cadillac, yeah"}}, {"title": "?", "album": "Stankonia", "year": "2000-10-31", "lyrics": "[Verse: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nWhat can make a nigga wanna

the pimp player nigga that you heard about\nYeah, I got the money and a half a million dope houses\nI got the hookers on the go and playa rhymes that I fuck with\nAnd bury amps that pops my trunk swift\nI've been a player since the age of two\nThat's when I learned to walk, grab my crotch, talk\nDo how them hustlers do\nSee born and raised as a pimp, that's what I claim to be\nAlways claiming true to what I do and then fuck what I see\nI pledge allegiance to the streets, that's where I growed up\nAnd make my money 'cause my daddy never showed up\nBut fuck it, I'm on my own, I'm in my zone\nAnd nothing wrong, you don't belong, you left me standing alone\nYeah, I'm the nigga with the feather in my hat\nFinger waves and snake skins, shit, I got all that\nBut you ain't know I'm the one dipping and dodging bullets\nThe price you pay when you behind it steady trying to pull it\nSo Dolemite, Dolemite not shit\nI studied The Mack and Rudy Ray Moore\nThey were my idols when I was a kid\nFrom nappy head, greasy face, eating watermelon\nTo drug dealer, armed robber, now convicted felon\n\n[Chorus: Big Boi]\nI wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes\nI put in work and did the dirt, that's how I paid my dues\nUh, 1-2-3, that's how it be\nSo all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me\nI wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes\nI put in work and did the dirt, that's how I paid my dues\nUh, 1-2-3, that's how it be\nSo all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me\n\n[Verse 2: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nOur heavenly Father, why do you even bother watching over me?\nGrowing up a little G, my mama thought I'd grow to be\nA lawyer or a doctor but I felt like coming harder\nPacked a shank up in my socks when I started kindergarten\nThis ain't no secret garden, so you flower niggas flee\nIf it is one of my own, I'm letting the trigger be\n'Cause I got love for any nigga who got love for me\nAnd then I get a slap or dap from niggas slinging quarter keys\nJust trying to make it, then of age, come through, take it\nI ain't forgot about y'all women who be working Nikki's butt naked\nAt Magic City, shaking titties just to pay the rent\nLord, trying to hustle must be something that was heaven sent\nBut I ain't got no sense, that's what I got them thinking\nI think about Barack, strap myself and keep on danking\n'Cause I be taking the rough side of the mountain\nIf you cross my path, I'll leave you draining like a fountain\nYes it's been like that since way back, in 1975\nBeen taught to hustle with muscle and even try to strive\nSo little batty bwoy better say your prayers\nYou better learn some street sense before somebody lay ya\n\n[Chorus: Big Boi]\nI wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes\nI put in work and did the dirt, that's how I paid my dues\nUh, 1-2-3, that's how it be\nSo all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me\nI wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes\nI put in work and did the dirt, that's how I paid my dues\nUh, 1-2-3, that's how it be\nSo all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of

houses\nI got the hookers on the go and playa rhymes that I fuck with\nAnd bury amps that pops my trunk swift\nI've been a player since the age of two\nThat's when I learned to walk, grab my crotch, talk\nDo how them hustlers do\nSee born and raised as a pimp, that's what I claim to be\nAlways claiming true to what I do and then fuck what I see\nI pledge allegiance to the streets, that's where I growed up\nAnd make my money 'cause my daddy never showed up\nBut fuck it, I'm on my own, I'm in my zone\nAnd nothing wrong, you don't belong, you left me standing alone\nYeah, I'm the nigga with the feather in my hat\nFinger waves and snake skins, shit, I got all that\nBut you ain't know I'm the one dipping and dodging bullets\nThe price you pay when you behind it steady trying to pull it\nSo Dolemite, Dolemite not shit\nI studied The Mack and Rudy Ray Moore\nThey were my idols when I was a kid\nFrom nappy head, greasy face, eating watermelon\nTo drug dealer, armed robber, now convicted felon\n\n[Chorus: Big Boi]\nI wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes\nI put in work and did the dirt, that's how I paid my dues\nUh, 1-2-3, that's how it be\nSo all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me\nI wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes\nI put in work and did the dirt, that's how I paid my dues\nUh, 1-2-3, that's how it be\nSo all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me\n\n[Verse 2: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nOur heavenly Father, why do you even bother watching over me?\nGrowing up a little G, my mama thought I'd grow to be\nA lawyer or a doctor but I felt like coming harder\nPacked a shank up in my socks when I started kindergarten\nThis ain't no secret garden, so you flower niggas flee\nIf it is one of my own, I'm letting the trigger be\n'Cause I got love for any nigga who got love for me\nAnd then I get a slap or dap from niggas slinging quarter keys\nJust trying to make it, then of age, come through, take it\nI ain't forgot about y'all women who be working Nikki's butt naked\nAt Magic City, shaking titties just to pay the rent\nLord, trying to hustle must be something that was heaven sent\nBut I ain't got no sense, that's what I got them thinking\nI think about Barack, strap myself and keep on danking\n'Cause I be taking the rough side of the mountain\nIf you cross my path, I'll leave you draining like a fountain\nYes it's been like that since way back, in 1975\nBeen taught to hustle with muscle and even try to strive\nSo little batty bwoy better say your prayers\nYou better learn some street sense before somebody lay ya\n\n[Chorus: Big Boi]\nI wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes\nI put in work and did the dirt, that's how I paid my dues\nUh, 1-2-3, that's how it be\nSo all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me\nI wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes\nI put in work and did the dirt, that's how I paid my dues\nUh, 1-2-3, that's how it be\nSo all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me\n\n[Break]\n\n[Chorus: Big Boi]\nI wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes\nI put in work and did the dirt, that's how I payed my dues\nUh, 1-2-3, that's how it be\nSo all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me\nI wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes\nI put in work and did the dirt, that's how I payed my dues\nUh, 1-2-3, that's how it be\nSo all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me\n\n[Rico Wade]\nWhat y'all fuck niggas know about that?\nOutKast, Goodie Mob, P.A\nSo all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me\n\n[Kawan \"K-Axe\" Prather]\nYeah, it's K-Axe, here to let y'all know\nAin't shit changed, just a couple of more names\nYeah, that's right\nOrganized Noize, JOI, Big Gipp, Big Rube\nCeeLo, Goodie Mob, P.A., and the muthafuckin' OutKast\nThat's right, nigga, we taking that bullshit no mo' in '94\nShit\n\n[Outro: Big Boi & (Rico Wade)]\nI wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes\n(Peace to the Godfather ass, gangsta ass niggas, Antonio Reid)\nSo all the real niggas step up

Lorena Bobitt maybe?\n\n[Hook: Big Boi]\nTomb after tomb, boom, boom after boom\nServing up emotion once you deep inside the tomb\nFrom embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb\nCool, ooh, that's cool\n\n[Verse 2: Lil' Brotha]\nYou see, I cock back Glocks, got more pull than slang shots\nHit G spots, I'm givin hoes back shots\nI'm a young country boy, long socks with flip flops\nBut I pull up on your block in the 500 Benz drop\nKonkrete, Aquemini, we takin this here to the top\nBust like balloons, who gives a damn if it goes pop\nYou say it's hot, well let me turn it up another notch\nTo my real niggas, won't you pump this out your Speakerboxxx\nFuck the cops, we makin noise and we won't stop\nBump, bump, there goes the boom and it's gon' drop\nOld school, big shoes, nigga, no socks\nWe keep tools, see fools, bullets will flock\n\n[Verse 3: Big Gipp]\nThey call me Mr. Ravioli, Mr. Streudel\nMr. Poke Em with the Noodle, Mr. Cockerspaniel in your Poodle\nAfter school tutor, Roto Rooter, addicted to follies\nLike brown collies, stay soft fro crows\nSwimming in the fallopian of an Ethiopian\nTalking a different language, RBI fly wide\nTalk to me now, 84 hard, 84 soft wit me now\nBeautiful ladies, they want to walk wit me now, talk wit me now\nPussy pop for me now, sell cock for me now\nFight a bitch, hit her in the eye for me now\nSee you when I see you, now I'm out wit me now\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 4: Supa Nate]\nI will never fall off, I haul off heavy weight\nFuck wit me dog, I chop you up like Norman Bates\nI'm true to this shit, I ain't new to this shit\nOver a million sold on strictly weed, bricks\nFlammable like gasoline when I'm lit up\nI prefer my liquor dark and a mean white slut\nIt's over for you, cavern ass rapper, get out the game\nYou can fool the record labels but not the streets mayne\nI just tell it how I see it nigga, facts is facts\nThe first verse I ever wrote, I got a Platinum plaque\nI've been to hell and back so nigga give me my props\nKonkrete, Big Boi, beatin through your Speakerboxxx, yeah!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 5: Ludacris]\nLudacris, yeah I keep a Glock in case you like to leak a lot\nMeanwhile, crankin' the volume knob up on my Speakerboxxx\nSo hear ye, \"Get the fuck on the ground!\"\nIs just a phrase you might hear strolling through the A-Town\nThey don't believe that we'll stab them in the abdomen\nFrom College Park, Georgia to College Park, Maryland\nSo put your fist up boy, you wanna romp\nYou can Bankhead Bounce or get Eastside Stomped\nThinking way back before I got mine\nPutting bullet holes through the neighborhood stop signs\nStill wild is my adrenaline, yes, ladies and gentleman\nDenenen, A hundred thou, bitch! Diamonds shimmerin\nCatch me with a sack of dro, reaching for The Strap Below\nOr with some nasty hoes, eating pistachios\nY'all driving Subarus, stuck in your cubicles\nI'm stuck in the air with weed crumbs under my cuticles\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 6: Big Boi]\nFourth and goal, should I take the three point field goal\nFor the score, or should I roll around and take the ball\nUp the middle, the gut, the what, the hole\nCranium overload, overthrowed, now we got seven more\nPoints on the board, fa sho\nB-I-G B-O-I, me oh my, I think He's blessing me\nExcelling in harmonious melody, boy we got the recipe\nLike Ragu, it's in there, giving you some of the best of me\nPlaya pimp gangsta poet, we gon spit it, we gon show it to yo ass\n\"You're a champion,\" were my dad's last words before he passed\nBut I know one day we will once more cross paths\nThey say, \"Big Boi, can you pull it off without your nigga Dre?\"\nI say, \"People, stop the madness cause me and Dre, we okay\"\nOutKast, Cell Therapy to cell division\nWe done split it down the middle so you can see both the visions\nBeen spittin it damn near 10 years, why the fuck would we be quittin?\nFuck nigga!", "image":

Dungeon Family all day long baby\nWe finna break it off with some fresh new shit\n\n[Verse 1: C-Bone]\nThis rap game lovely\nKonkrete play a part cause the Feds want to bug me\nAthletes want to be rappers, shawty, trust me\nBending corners in the Benz, ridin like a bucket, nigga fuck it\nI know some hoes slutty\nI auctioned a bitch off like a nigga playin rugby\nI done seen a ghetto meal, little buddy, trust me\nJump European, came clean through customs, no questions\nPerpetrators in the booth, rappin lame like they drug related\nIt made me sick to my stomach, lost a two and a baby\nYou don't grind, you be lying\nShould be castrated, Lorena Bobitt maybe?\n\n[Hook: Big Boi]\nTomb after tomb, boom, boom after boom\nServing up emotion once you deep inside the tomb\nFrom embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb\nCool, ooh, that's cool\n\n[Verse 2: Lil' Brotha]\nYou see, I cock back Glocks, got more pull than slang shots\nHit G spots, I'm givin hoes back shots\nI'm a young country boy, long socks with flip flops\nBut I pull up on your block in the 500 Benz drop\nKonkrete, Aquemini, we takin this here to the top\nBust like balloons, who gives a damn if it goes pop\nYou say it's hot, well let me turn it up another notch\nTo my real niggas, won't you pump this out your Speakerboxxx\nFuck the cops, we makin noise and we won't stop\nBump, bump, there goes the boom and it's gon' drop\nOld school, big shoes, nigga, no socks\nWe keep tools, see fools, bullets will flock\n\n[Verse 3: Big Gipp]\nThey call me Mr. Ravioli, Mr. Streudel\nMr. Poke Em with the Noodle, Mr. Cockerspaniel in your Poodle\nAfter school tutor, Roto Rooter, addicted to follies\nLike brown collies, stay soft fro crows\nSwimming in the fallopian of an Ethiopian\nTalking a different language, RBI fly wide\nTalk to me now, 84 hard, 84 soft wit me now\nBeautiful ladies, they want to walk wit me now, talk wit me now\nPussy pop for me now, sell cock for me now\nFight a bitch, hit her in the eye for me now\nSee you when I see you, now I'm out wit me now\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 4: Supa Nate]\nI will never fall off, I haul off heavy weight\nFuck wit me dog, I chop you up like Norman Bates\nI'm true to this shit, I ain't new to this shit\nOver a million sold on strictly weed, bricks\nFlammable like gasoline when I'm lit up\nI prefer my liquor dark and a mean white slut\nIt's over for you, cavern ass rapper, get out the game\nYou can fool the record labels but not the streets mayne\nI just tell it how I see it nigga, facts is facts\nThe first verse I ever wrote, I got a Platinum plaque\nI've been to hell and back so nigga give me my props\nKonkrete, Big Boi, beatin through your Speakerboxxx, yeah!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 5: Ludacris]\nLudacris, yeah I keep a Glock in case you like to leak a lot\nMeanwhile, crankin' the volume knob up on my Speakerboxxx\nSo hear ye, \"Get the fuck on the ground!\"\nIs just a phrase you might hear strolling through the A-Town\nThey don't believe that we'll stab them in the abdomen\nFrom College Park, Georgia to College Park, Maryland\nSo put your fist up boy, you wanna romp\nYou can Bankhead Bounce or get Eastside Stomped\nThinking way back before I got mine\nPutting bullet holes through the neighborhood stop signs\nStill wild is my adrenaline, yes, ladies and gentleman\nDenenen, A hundred thou, bitch! Diamonds shimmerin\nCatch me with a sack of dro, reaching for The Strap Below\nOr with some nasty hoes, eating pistachios\nY'all driving Subarus, stuck in your cubicles\nI'm stuck in the air with weed crumbs under my cuticles\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 6: Big Boi]\nFourth and goal, should I take the three point field goal\nFor the score, or should I roll around and take the ball\nUp the middle, the gut, the what, the hole\nCranium overload, overthrowed, now we got seven more\nPoints on the board, fa sho\nB-I-G B-O-I, me oh my, I think He's blessing me\nExcelling in harmonious melody, boy we got the recipe\nLike Ragu, it's in there, giving you some of the best of me\nPlaya pimp gangsta poet, we gon spit it, we gon show it to yo ass\n\"You're a champion,\" were my dad's last words before he passed\nBut I know one day we will once more cross paths\nThey say, \"Big Boi, can you pull it off without your nigga Dre?\"\nI say, \"People, stop the madness cause me and Dre, we okay\"\nOutKast, Cell Therapy to cell division\nWe done split it down the middle so you can see both the visions\nBeen spittin it damn near 10 years, why the fuck would we be quittin?\nFuck nigga!"}}, {"title": "The

Not hardly; I'm trying to stay up outta that womb\nOr that p-u-s-s uss, I said uss\nLuther Vandross couldn't make a home out of this house that we smooshed\nSmashed, pushed to the limit, Smash and turned it timid\nHell everyone was suffering, the house was feeling wicked\nThe cat got sold, the dog got old, the food got cold\nBoth of our tempers were on swolle\nFor the most, part you fuss, fight, fart\nYou build it up to break it down and now take it from the start\nRepeatedly leading a path that only ends in a clash\nOf two stubborn minds, grown folks blind to the sign\n\n[Hook x4]\nThrow your neck out\nThrow your back out\n\n[Verse 3:]\nK-O, knocked out by technicality\nThe love has kissed the canvas, now the whole family is mad at me\nMy daughter don't want me at her PTA meetings\nAnd then my son, he can't talk, when I change him he's peeing\nI think he's pissed, I can't dismiss the matter of the fact\nBecause he saw you and me argue, now the energy is coming back\nSet an example, a positive pattern, keep life on track\nBut I'm married to the music and committed to the wax, tapes and CDs\n\n[Bridge]\nTapes, CD's, Baby please, you make me want to scream\nYou're on my team starting first string so why are we arguing?\nWax, tapes, CD's, Baby please, you make me want to scream\nYou're on my team starting first string so why are we arguing?\n\n[Hook x4]\nThrow your neck out\nThrow your back out\n\n[Bridge]\nTapes, CD's, Baby please, you make me want to scream\nYou're on my team starting first string so why are we arguing?Tapes, CD's, Baby please, you make me want to scream\nYou're on my team starting first string so why are we arguing?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/547d6239cd014bda1acb0078d0ddaafc.999x999x1.jpg", "artist": "OutKast", "raw": {"annotation_count": 15, "api_path": "/songs/36298", "apple_music_id": "281430672", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/36298/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "OutKast released their double album \u201cSpeakerboxxx/The Love Below\u201d in 2003 upon critical acclaim.

Not hardly; I'm trying to stay up outta that womb\nOr that p-u-s-s uss, I said uss\nLuther Vandross couldn't make a home out of this house that we smooshed\nSmashed, pushed to the limit, Smash and turned it timid\nHell everyone was suffering, the house was feeling wicked\nThe cat got sold, the dog got old, the food got cold\nBoth of our tempers were on swolle\nFor the most, part you fuss, fight, fart\nYou build it up to break it down and now take it from the start\nRepeatedly leading a path that only ends in a clash\nOf two stubborn minds, grown folks blind to the sign\n\n[Hook x4]\nThrow your neck out\nThrow your back out\n\n[Verse 3:]\nK-O, knocked out by technicality\nThe love has kissed the canvas, now the whole family is mad at me\nMy daughter don't want me at her PTA meetings\nAnd then my son, he can't talk, when I change him he's peeing\nI think he's pissed, I can't dismiss the matter of the fact\nBecause he saw you and me argue, now the energy is coming back\nSet an example, a positive pattern, keep life on track\nBut I'm married to the music and committed to the wax, tapes and CDs\n\n[Bridge]\nTapes, CD's, Baby please, you make me want to scream\nYou're on my team starting first string so why are we arguing?\nWax, tapes, CD's, Baby please, you make me want to scream\nYou're on my team starting first string so why are we arguing?\n\n[Hook x4]\nThrow your neck out\nThrow your back out\n\n[Bridge]\nTapes, CD's, Baby please, you make me want to scream\nYou're on my team starting first string so why are we arguing?Tapes,

Southernplayalistic pimp is up in this bitch\nMan, my folkers up on that track, complimentin' that wickedness\nSee one is for the money, two is for my niggas who jack\nNiggas ain't takin' that shit no

comfort, too close to home\nToo close to be playin' your boy, so hey, why don't you get your own?\nAs long, as I got this legally\nPeople see that we can be on top of things without causin' another nigga sorrow\nI know it seems it ain't enough to go around\nBut keep on holdin' on like Goodie Mob 'cause it's a better day tomorrow\nThat's all I can say, can't tell the future\nTomorrow's another day but today, they just might shoot you\nFor your ride, fuck your pride, hide better be out your seat\nQuick and snappy with a happy face before you bleed\nAsk me, if that material shit is worth your life\nI don't know about yours, but if so, you smoking pipes, right?\n\n[Hook 4X]\nEither want a Benz or a Beamer\n\n[Verse 2]\n[Andr\u00e9 3000]\nDeep in the Dungeon for these many months\nAmongst the Dungeon Dragon as we pass around dem blunts\nHad to cut it out like shears, but for years I used to burn 'em\nGettin deep off in my thoughts just to get shit off my sternum\nChest/chess, I never played but made many a moves\nI still blame it on the session 'cause I can't remember the due\nI guess, I feel that getting a Benz is out of the question\nThe world is yelling Hootie Hoo but in my pockets nuthin but\nGum and lint, to sum the shit, up, I'm broke\nNothin' but hope, so Big Boi, tell 'em what you toke\n\n[Big Boi]\nI'm travellin' up to Jersey with four keys off in my trunk\nAnd thinkin' of startin' the ways to get that motherfucker crunk\nSee yes I be that nigga that with that sess off in my chest\nSmokin' and chokin' them token blacks, that wanted to test\nSee strong niggas survive and the weak niggas they die\nI never fuck no white bitch, I stopped eatin' at pig stys\nBe activatin that Lo-Jack 'cause the Fleetwood has been stolen\nCampbellton Road is open, the B-I-G has

good sir\nHow do you do? Look fine\nFantastically well, I am certainly not fine by far\nBut you could say I'm close to spectacular\nClose to spectacular? How so?\nOpen your eyes, spectacular's right in front of you\nWhatever you say, you're spectacular\nNo, I'm fantastically well\nCome on, man, make up your mind\nA minute ago, you said you were fine\nNo, I said I'm \"close to spectacular\"\nBut I'm meetin' fine in a minute\nClose to spectacular?

on it only gets rougher!)\nSisters at the crib knowing\n(From this point on it only gets rougher!)\nPreachers at the church knowing, but still get by\n(From this point on it only gets rougher!)\nTeachers at the school knowing\n(From this point on it only gets rougher!)\nBabies on the bottle knowing\n(From this point on it only gets rougher!)\nJunkies on the corner knowing, but still get high\n(From this point on it only gets rougher!)\n\n[Verse 1: Big Boi]\nWell, here's a formal introduction\nSomething to make you ponder\nThe situation's ugly like In Living Color's Wanda\n(Word up!)\nNow, everybody play dumb, but there's some that succumb\nOr fall victim, I will overcome\nAny hurdle or obstacle that's in my path\nFast cash should be the last resort, so make it last\nFor the risk you took, trick, you shook your ass\nFor some hundred dollar heels and a designer bag\nNow that's ass backwards\nAll you got in the refrigerator is bratwurst\nYour stomach is balled in a knot, you got that phat purse\nPocketbook, stop and look, pockets look void\nDestroyed by the need to indulge and enjoy the finer things in life\nYour dignity the only sacrifice\nSlim as your chances of being somebody's wife\nThey seeing ya butt booty naked every night\nAin't nothing right or wrong!\n\n[Hook: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nBrothers on the block knowing\n(From this point on it only gets rougher!)\nSisters at the crib knowing\n(From this point on it only gets rougher!)\nPreachers at the church knowing, but still get by\n(From this point on it only gets rougher!)\nTeachers at the school knowing\n(From this point on it only gets rougher!)\nBabies on the bottle knowing\n(From this point on it only gets rougher!)\nJunkies on the corner knowing, but still get high\n(From this point on it only gets rougher!)\n\n[Verse 2: Big Boi]\nEven though things started falling apart\nWanda went and bought a Honda, now she's out of a job\nShe would slob on a knob for a little less than a yard\nA massage, you could drill her like a sarge\nShe would charge and rob, pick through your pockets\nShe got the trick's watch and the silver locket\nThat he bought for his wife but Wanda left her license\nOn the nightstand fuckin' with this white man\nShe met in a little red Corvette, paid for sex\nMade a deal that she would never forget, you can bet\nEvery action has a positive and equal reaction\nTherefore everything that goes around comes around in that fashion\nFast and furiously, there was a knock on the sliding glass door (Bitch, it's me!\nYou thought you was slick the way you hit me for that lick\nBut you slipped, now I'm getting in your shit!)\n\n[Hook: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nBrothers on the block knowing\n(From this point on it only gets rougher!)\nSisters at the crib knowing\n(From this point on it only gets rougher!)\nPreachers at the church knowing, but still get by\n(From this point on it only gets rougher!)\nTeachers at the school knowing\n(From this point on it only gets rougher!)\nBabies on the bottle knowing\n(From this point on it only gets rougher!)\nJunkies on the corner knowing, but still get high\n(From this point on it only gets rougher!)\n\n(From

This was Cee-Lo\u2019s first collaboration with any member of the Goodie Mob since World Party, and he said the following regarding his involvement in \u201cReset\u201d:\n\n\nI got the invite to come and be a part of it. Typically, I would go in and I would pick something, but this time Big just had me in mind. I think he just felt really strongly that this was a record that would just suit me, and he was right. When you\u2019re presented with an ultimatum like that, you just want to deliver, you know what I mean? I just definitely wanted to step up and deliver. That\u2019s really what the simple motivation is, and then I just began to reflect on things that were immediate in my everyday life.\n\nI think in some type of roundabout way, it was kind of an opportunity for us to all showcase together. Me and Goodie, we were at industrial odds, not internal odds. We were never uncool, we were always family. With family, you have that sibling rivalry, that internal riffing and that\u2019s to be expected. We\u2019re all men, all individuals. they have different opinions, priorities, different focuses, different flaws.\n\n\nKhujo Goodie added how the song\u2019s theme fit his life after he had part of his right leg amputated due to a car accident he had in 2002:\n\n\nThat particular song definitely fit the way my life was going at the time because I had to reset, man. I had to go back in and rethink some things. I had to re-evaluate myself, and I had to get back in there, get back on my job.\n\nCee-Lo wasn\u2019t on the song yet, and I think that Big Boi was already on the song, and the hook was too. Once I heard the hook, I started vibin\u2019 with it. I was like, \u201cMan, this shit would go perfect with what I\u2019m going through right now.\""}, "embed_content": "<div id='rg_embed_link_36287' class='rg_embed_link' data-song-id='36287'>Read <a

after making mistakes.\n\nBetween the time of OutKast\u2019s previous album, 2000\u2019s Stankonia, and this Speakerboxxx album, Cee-Lo dissed the Goodie Mob\u2019s third album, 1999\u2019s World Party, and he subsequently began his solo career, causing a rift between Cee-Lo and the rest of the group. This was Cee-Lo\u2019s first collaboration with any member of the Goodie Mob since World Party, and he said the following regarding his involvement in \u201cReset\u201d:\n\n\nI got the invite to come and be a part of it. Typically, I would go in and I would pick something, but this time Big just had me in mind. I think he just felt really strongly that this was a record that would just suit me, and he was right. When you\u2019re presented with an ultimatum like that, you just want to deliver, you know what I mean? I just definitely wanted to step up and deliver. That\u2019s really what the simple motivation is, and then I just began to reflect on things that were immediate in my everyday life.\n\nI think in some type of roundabout way, it was kind of an opportunity for us to all showcase together. Me and Goodie, we were at industrial odds, not internal odds. We were never uncool, we were always family. With family, you have that sibling rivalry, that internal riffing and that\u2019s to be expected. We\u2019re all men, all individuals. they have different opinions, priorities, different focuses, different flaws.\n\n\nKhujo Goodie added how the song\u2019s theme fit his life after he had part of his right leg amputated due to a car accident he had in 2002:\n\n\nThat particular song definitely fit the way my life was going at the time because I had to reset, man. I had to go back in and rethink some things. I had to re-evaluate myself, and I had to get back in there, get back on my job.\n\nCee-Lo wasn\u2019t on the song yet, and I think that Big Boi was already on the song, and the hook was too. Once I heard the hook, I started vibin\u2019 with it. I was like, \u201cMan, this shit would go perfect with what I\u2019m going through right now.\""}, "comment_count": 0, "community": true, "custom_preview": null, "has_voters": true, "id": 3526563,

spirit is touched\nYou know what, I take that back, why? You was alive\nDate of conception, interception cause the sperm did collide\nFrom T 'n A to DNA, feelings turn to children\nThe morning after pill didn't put a halt to our very existance\nWe livin, breathin, soon we'll be teethin\nOur granny got a gold and now we want one for that reason\nAn adolescent mind is so impressionable in those stages\nBut parents got to parent their kids to keep them out of cages\nCell therapists beware of this lugie that I spit\nIncarceration without rehabilitation really don't mean shit\nLittle Ricky's home, he gotta serve probation for six months\nBut Uncle Darnell and Ol' Dirty Bastard still in the joint\nReset\n\n[Debra Killings]\nStart over again\nEverything happens for a reason\nGood doesn't come without pain\nStart over again\nEverything happens for a reason\nStart over again\nEverything happens for a reason\nGood doesn't come without pain\nStart over again\nEverything happens for a reason\n\n[Khujo]\nGood does not come without pain\nMeaning, before it gets better, it's goin get worse\nLike my homies on the sick side still dyin over turf\nThat don't belong to urse; I mean us, left in the dust\nTry to catch up with massah\nI used to wanna wrap my hands around the esophagus\nOf them crackers, but Ephesians 6:12\nSaid it wasn't flesh and blood that we wrestle against\nPrincipalities, powers of this world\nRulers of darkness and spiritual wickedness\nIn high places, so throw that whole armor of righteousness\nI spark this thang, but my name ain't Bubba\nI got a problem with racist cab drivers, like Glover\nAnd brothers that wax fat and forget all about the struggle\nYeah, come on, come on, guess what, guess what\nTime to reset this thang\n\n[Debra Killings]\nStart over again\nEverything happens for a reason\nGood doesn't come without pain\nStart over again\nEverything happens for a reason\n\n[Cee-Lo]\nListen to me, I awaken to sunlight\nThat's beyond bright; this day will be done right\nThere is a war just waiting on the other side of the door\nBut I'll be bringing God to the gunfight\nCan't live forever, so have some fun, right?\nLife's a bowl of candy, you can have one, right?\nYou can handle if tomorrow never come, right?\nYou'll get used to singin if only for one night\nBut I intend to raise two daughters and a son right\nAnd I couldn't have wrote this if I was hopeless\nAnd see I focus to provoke this\nSo open wide for my opinionated opus\nStop playin Go Fish, but not below this\nBefore I go, I thought that you all should know this\nRecognize and realize before any regretting\nBefore you relapse, perhaps you'll consider resetting\nHmm?\n\n[Debra Killings]\nStart over again\nEverything happens for a reason\nGood doesn't come without pain\nStart over again\nEverything happens for a reason"}}, {"title": "True Dat (Interlude)", "album": "Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik", "year": "1994-04-26", "lyrics": "[Big Rube]\nOperating under the crooked American system too long\nOutKast, pronounced outcast\nAdjective meaning homeless, or unaccepted in society\nBut let's look deeper than that\nAre you an OutKast?\nIf you understand and feel the basic principles and\nFundamental truths contained within this music, you probably are\nIf you think it's all about pimpin' hoes and slamming Cadillac do's\nYou probably a cracker, or a nigga that think he a cracker\nOr maybe just don't understand\nAn OutKast is someone who is not considered to be part of the normal world\nHe is looked at differently\nHe is not accepted because of his clothes, his hair\nHis occupation, his beliefs or his skin color\nNow look at yourself, are you an OutKast?

slamming Cadillac do's\nYou probably a cracker, or a nigga that think he a cracker\nOr maybe just don't understand\nAn OutKast is someone who is not considered to be part of the normal world\nHe is looked at differently\nHe is not accepted because of his clothes, his hair\nHis occupation, his beliefs or his skin color\nNow look at yourself, are you an OutKast?  I know I am\nAs a matter of fact, fuck being anything else\nIt's only so much time left in this crazy world\nWake up niggas and realize what's going on around you\nPoisoning of the food and water\nTampering of cigarettes\nDisease engineering control over your life\nTake back your existence or die like a punk\nThis is Big Rube, sayin' right on to the real, and death to the fakers\nPeace out"}}, {"title": "Hold On, Be Strong", "album": "Aquemini", "year": "1998-09-29", "lyrics": "[Produced by Donny Mathis & OutKast]\n\nHold on, be strong\nHold on, be strong\nHold on, be strong\nHold on, be strong\nHold on...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1d70ec18b556343d079f83245405002c.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "OutKast", "raw": {"annotation_count": 3, "api_path": "/songs/493826", "apple_music_id": "266365277", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/493826/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "The intro to OutKast\u2019s seminal album Aquemini serves as the calm before the upcoming storm.

the flow start shakin' it all (YES Y'ALL)\nWhat we drinking, no we drinking it all (EH)\nWe gon do it 'til we can't or we fall, Last call\nTell them mothafuckas holding the wall: (FUCK Y'ALL!!)\nHit the flow start shaking it all (YES Y'ALL)\nWhat we drinking, no we drinking it all (EH)\nWe gon do it 'til we can't or we fall, Last call\n\n[Verse 1 : Mello]\nNow look here\nI'm gon' hit da club man, I'm gon' get some love\nI'm the coolest nigga ain't gon' spend more than a dub\nI'm gon' tell that broad and her chicken head friend\nNo Ferrari, no Jag, no Bentley, or a Benz\nMight just play the wall with this mean look on my grill\nAct like I'm da hater, the Haitian from Hateville\nI remember her, act like she don't remember me\nWhen I was Cadillac'n, Coupe Deville'in, and chickenhead drillin'\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2 : Big Boi]\nI'm gon' get that fresh-fly fade and then I'm gon' get laid\nLike some finger-waves on pay day, my lady, you gon' get paid\nMaking a early morning serenade for you to start your day\nOr the sound of a starter pistol fired close to where you lay\nLast call for alcohol, make a fast call for the hay\nThe dirty Dungeon [?] has informed me the drought has ended today\nWith no delay\nAnd a, four piece grizzle we on our way\nFor a brief stay in a sweet place for a petite face to lay\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3 : Slimm Calhoun]\nThem boys so wild, don't crack no smile\nCloset like the Wild Kingdom: fox, minks, and crocodiles\nPopped tops and what we drink, so sit back for a while\nMatter a fact, light that, and I'll be right back\nThey want a couple more bottles I got something for 'em to swallow\nAnybody ever told you you look like a model?\nYou know the story, she bit the hook, line, and follow\nGot my hooks in the back and I'm a grind until tomorrow\nThey call me Mack Rapalicious, and when I bubble\nI blow trouble up, in your ear\nThey call me Mack Rapalicicious, and when I bubble\nIt's, trouble all up in you dear!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 4 : Mello]\nYes, I know the way excite them hoes\nMe cold reptilian feet, bite them hoes\nGot a partner, oh his mind sick\nHe say he loved this ol' coke-strung-out stripper bitch\nWhy he so dumb?\nI'm so pimp it's ridiculous\nGot tinted windows on my ride I'm inconspicuous\nRun with this pretty thang\nShe ain't yours you wish she was\nWe don't stop, it's so repeated and continuous\nMello Capone, Don Huggy Bear\nPokey the fuckin' pimpolous, ain't that cute slick em, out their draws I'm so infamous\nDead serious\nFrom the club, to the Caddy, to the Holiday Inn\nFrom the dusk til' the dawn we gon' do it again\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/547d6239cd014bda1acb0078d0ddaafc.999x999x1.jpg", "artist": "OutKast", "raw": {"annotation_count": 13, "api_path": "/songs/36291",

(YES Y'ALL)\nWhat we drinking, no we drinking it all (EH)\nWe gon do it 'til we can't or we fall, Last call\nTell them mothafuckas holding the wall: (FUCK Y'ALL!!)\nHit the flow start shaking it all (YES Y'ALL)\nWhat we drinking, no we drinking it all (EH)\nWe gon do it 'til we can't or we fall, Last call\n\n[Verse 1 : Mello]\nNow look here\nI'm gon' hit da club man, I'm gon' get some love\nI'm the coolest nigga ain't gon' spend more than a dub\nI'm gon' tell that broad and her chicken head friend\nNo Ferrari, no Jag, no Bentley, or a Benz\nMight just play the wall with this mean look on my grill\nAct like I'm da hater, the Haitian from Hateville\nI remember her, act like she don't remember me\nWhen I was Cadillac'n, Coupe Deville'in, and chickenhead drillin'\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2 : Big Boi]\nI'm gon' get that fresh-fly fade and then I'm gon' get laid\nLike some finger-waves on pay day, my lady, you gon' get paid\nMaking a early morning serenade for you to start your day\nOr the sound of a starter pistol fired close to where you lay\nLast call for alcohol, make a fast call for the hay\nThe dirty Dungeon [?] has informed me the drought has ended today\nWith no delay\nAnd a, four piece grizzle we on our way\nFor a brief stay in a sweet place for a petite face to lay\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3 : Slimm Calhoun]\nThem boys so wild, don't crack no smile\nCloset like the Wild Kingdom: fox, minks, and crocodiles\nPopped tops and what we drink, so sit back for a while\nMatter a fact, light that, and I'll be right back\nThey want a couple more bottles I got something for 'em to swallow\nAnybody ever told you you look like a model?\nYou know the story, she bit the hook, line, and follow\nGot my hooks in the back and I'm a grind until tomorrow\nThey call me Mack Rapalicious, and when I bubble\nI blow trouble up, in your ear\nThey call me Mack Rapalicicious, and when I bubble\nIt's, trouble all up in you dear!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 4 : Mello]\nYes, I know the way excite them hoes\nMe cold reptilian feet, bite them hoes\nGot a partner, oh his mind sick\nHe say he loved this ol' coke-strung-out stripper bitch\nWhy he so dumb?\nI'm so pimp it's ridiculous\nGot tinted windows on my ride I'm inconspicuous\nRun with this pretty thang\nShe ain't yours you wish she was\nWe don't stop, it's so repeated and continuous\nMello Capone, Don Huggy Bear\nPokey the fuckin' pimpolous, ain't that cute slick em, out their draws I'm so infamous\nDead serious\nFrom the club, to the Caddy, to the Holiday Inn\nFrom the dusk til' the dawn we gon' do it again\n\n[Hook]"}}, {"title": "Bust", "album": "Speakerboxxx / The Love Below", "year": "2003-09-23", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nGhosts and goblins run amok\nIn the caverns of rhine\nSlinging petty

the baddest motherfuckers are the ones that are chose!\nSome of the coolest individuals on the planet we said\nBest believe that we can buck or give a damn if we care!\nNo collision supervision but my family is here\nNow my mama taught my niggas that was under the stairs\nOne of those who chauffeured life and then was unprepared\nBut my hunger is the thunder, no wonder it can't be smothered\nOr buttered up, buttercup, melt your sauce\nYou a Chuck E. Cheese bouncer chumpin' off the boss\nWhat I'm trying to tell you now is that you're softer than soft\nAnd I'm sick as a cough, did I mention it's raw?\nYour predicaments flawed, flaw means fucked up\nAnd serving out the oven not fried, slow roast\nNo coast, tuck your tail and hide!\nYou scared?\n\n[Hook]\nYeah!!!!!!!\nGive to you and I do what it takes!\nTo give it to you!\nBust...bust!\n\n[Verse 2: Killer Mike]\nI officially do it with duns on tour\nWe lock down traps, push caps galore\nMy wiz cook work 'til it scale like fish\nMy old earth even known to handle biz\nI serve whipped, out of whips, whip out cash\nUsually keep a G-pack on the dash\nTry to test my gangsta, I bring harm\nI'm as slick as Freeway Rick and Nicholas Barnes\nMy Uptown Nikes hold caps and cheddar\nMy waistline hold a 4-pound Baretta\nI'll shoelace your face just to learn you better\nMy ox so sharp it cut through leather\nMy rap name Killer, my street name Skunk\nI mastered the music that was born in the Bronx!\nI switch my slang spit from my mouth\nI'm still all coast, my coast the South!!!\n\n[Hook]\nYeah!!!!!!!\nGive to you and I do what it takes!\nTo give it to

realms of space where nobody goes\nOnly the baddest motherfuckers are the ones that are chose!\nSome of the coolest individuals on the planet we said\nBest believe that we can buck or give a damn if we care!\nNo collision supervision but my family is here\nNow my mama taught my niggas that was under the stairs\nOne of those who chauffeured life and then was unprepared\nBut my hunger is the thunder, no wonder it can't be smothered\nOr buttered up, buttercup, melt your sauce\nYou a Chuck E. Cheese bouncer chumpin' off the boss\nWhat I'm trying to tell you now is that you're softer than soft\nAnd I'm sick as a cough, did I mention it's raw?\nYour predicaments flawed, flaw means fucked up\nAnd serving out the oven not fried, slow roast\nNo coast, tuck your tail and hide!\nYou scared?\n\n[Hook]\nYeah!!!!!!!\nGive to you and I do what it takes!\nTo give it to you!\nBust...bust!\n\n[Verse 2: Killer Mike]\nI officially do it with duns on tour\nWe lock down traps, push caps galore\nMy wiz cook work 'til it scale like fish\nMy old earth even known to handle biz\nI serve whipped, out of whips, whip out cash\nUsually keep a G-pack on the dash\nTry to test my gangsta, I bring harm\nI'm as slick as Freeway Rick and Nicholas Barnes\nMy Uptown Nikes hold caps and cheddar\nMy waistline hold a 4-pound Baretta\nI'll shoelace your face just to learn you better\nMy ox so sharp it cut through leather\nMy rap name Killer, my street name Skunk\nI mastered the music that was born in the Bronx!\nI switch my slang spit from my mouth\nI'm still all coast, my coast the South!!!\n\n[Hook]\nYeah!!!!!!!\nGive to you and I do what it takes!\nTo give it to you!\nBust...bust!"}}, {"title": "Kim & Cookie (Interlude)", "album": "Stankonia", "year": "2000-10-31", "lyrics": "[Announcer]\nAnd now, Kim and Cookie\n\nCookie: Ring-Ring\nKim: Say hello Cookie!\nCookie: Hello\nKim: Girl, I got something to tell ya\nCookie: Spill it girl, spill it\nKim: Remember ol' boi, at the club...\nCookie: From last night?\nKim: Last night!\nCookie: What's up?\nKim: Went home with the mothafucka, now I'm thinkin I'm fittin' to goddamn get my ass to' up!\n(Background singers: To' up!)\nKim: But girl...\nCookie: What?\nKim: Dick so short!\n(Short!)
